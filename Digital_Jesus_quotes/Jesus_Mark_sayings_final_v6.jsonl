"The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ
 the Son of God; ","and saying
 The time is fulfilled
 and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye
 and believe the gospel. ","And Jesus said unto them
 Come ye after me
 and I will make you to become fishers of men. ","And Jesus rebuked him
 saying
 Hold thy peace
 and come out of him. ","And when they had found him
 they said unto him
 All men seek for thee. ","And he said unto them
 Let us go into the next towns
 that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth. ","And Jesus
 moved with compassion
 put forth his hand
 and touched him
 and saith unto him
 I will; be thou clean. ","and saith unto him
 See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way
 shew thyself to the priest
 and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded
 for a testimony unto them. ","When Jesus saw their faith
 he said unto the sick of the palsy
 Son
 thy sins be forgiven thee. ","And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves
 he said unto them
 Why reason ye these things in your hearts? ","Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy
 Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say
 Arise
 and take up thy bed
 and walk? ","But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins
 (he saith to the sick of the palsy
) ","I say unto thee
 Arise
 and take up thy bed
 and go thy way into thine house. ","And as he passed by
 he saw Levi the son of Alph\u00e6us sitting at the receipt of custom
 and said unto him
 Follow me. And he arose and followed him. ","When Jesus heard it
 he saith unto them
 They that are whole have no need of the physician
 but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous
 but sinners to repentance.","And Jesus said unto them
 Can the children of the bridechamber fast
 while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them
 they cannot fast. ","But the days will come
 when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them
 and then shall they fast in those days. ","No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old
 and the rent is made worse. ","And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: else the new wine doth burst the bottles
 and the wine is spilled
 and the bottles will be marred: but new wine must be put into new bottles.","And the Pharisees said unto him
 Behold
 why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful? ","And he said unto them
 Have ye never read what David did
 when he had need
 and was an hungred
 he
 and they that were with him? ","And he said unto them
 The sabbath was made for man
 and not man for the sabbath: ","therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.","And he saith unto the man which had the withered hand
 Stand forth. ","And he saith unto them
 Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days
 or to do evil? to save life
 or to kill? But they held their peace. ","And when he had looked round about on them with anger
 being grieved for the hardness of their hearts
 he saith unto the man
 Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it out: and his hand was restored whole as the other. ","And he called them unto him
 and said unto them in parables
 How can Satan cast out Satan? ","And if a kingdom be divided against itself
 that kingdom cannot stand. ","And if a house be divided against itself
 that house cannot stand. ","And if Satan rise up against himself
 and be divided
 he cannot stand
 but hath an end. ","No man can enter into a strong man\u2019s house
 and spoil his goods
 except he will first bind the strong man; and then he will spoil his house. ","Verily I say unto you
 All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men
 and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme: ","but he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness
 but is in danger of eternal damnation: ","And the multitude sat about him
 and they said unto him
 Behold
 thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee. ","And he answered them
 saying
 Who is my mother
 or my brethren? ","And he looked round about on them which sat about him
 and said
 Behold my mother and my brethren! ","For whosoever shall do the will of God
 the same is my brother
 and my sister
 and mother.","And he taught them many things by parables
 and said unto them in his doctrine
 ","Hearken; Behold
 there went out a sower to sow: ","and it came to pass
 as he sowed
 some fell by the way side
 and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up. ","And some fell on stony ground
 where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up
 because it had no depth of earth: ","but when the sun was up
 it was scorched; and because it had no root
 it withered away. ","And some fell among thorns
 and the thorns grew up
 and choked it
 and it yielded no fruit. ","And other fell on good ground
 and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth
 some thirty
 and some sixty
 and some an hundred. ","And he said unto them
 He that hath ears to hear
 let him hear. ","And he said unto them
 Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without
 all these things are done in parables: ","that seeing they may see
 and not perceive; and hearing they may hear
 and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted
 and their sins should be forgiven them. ","And he said unto them
 Know ye not this parable? and how then will ye know all parables? ","The sower soweth the word.","And these are they by the way side
 where the word is sown; but when they have heard
 Satan cometh immediately
 and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts. ","And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who
 when they have heard the word
 immediately receive it with gladness; ","and have no root in themselves
 and so endure but for a time: afterward
 when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word\u2019s sake
 immediately they are offended. ","And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word
 ","and the cares of this world
 and the deceitfulness of riches
 and the lusts of other things entering in
 choke the word
 and it becometh unfruitful. ","And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word
 and receive it
 and bring forth fruit
 some thirtyfold
 some sixty
 and some an hundred.","And he said unto them
 Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel
 or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick? ","For there is nothing hid
 which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret
 but that it should come abroad. ","If any man have ears to hear
 let him hear.","And he said unto them
 Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete
 it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given. ","For he that hath
 to him shall be given: and he that hath not
 from him shall be taken even that which he hath.","And he said
 So is the kingdom of God
 as if a man should cast seed into the ground; ","and should sleep
 and rise night and day
 and the seed should spring and grow up
 he knoweth not how. ","For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade
 then the ear
 after that the full corn in the ear. ","But when the fruit is brought forth
 immediately he putteth in the sickle
 because the harvest is come.","And he said
 Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it? ","It is like a grain of mustard seed
 which
 when it is sown in the earth
 is less than all the seeds that be in the earth: ","but when it is sown
 it groweth up
 and becometh greater than all herbs
 and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it. ","And the same day
 when the even was come
 he saith unto them
 Let us pass over unto the other side. ","And he arose
 and rebuked the wind
 and said unto the sea
 Peace
 be still. And the wind ceased
 and there was a great calm. ","And he said unto them
 Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith? ","For he said unto him
 Come out of the man
 thou unclean spirit. ","And he asked him
 What is thy name? And he answered
 saying
 My name is Legion: for we are many. ","Howbeit Jesus suffered him not
 but saith unto him
 Go home to thy friends
 and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee
 and hath had compassion on thee. ","For she said
 If I may touch but his clothes
 I shall be whole. ","And his disciples said unto him
 Thou seest the multitude thronging thee
 and sayest thou
 Who touched me? ","And he said unto her
 Daughter
 thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace
 and be whole of thy plague.","As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken
 he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue
 Be not afraid
 only believe. ","And when he was come in
 he saith unto them
 Why make ye this ado
 and weep? the damsel is not dead
 but sleepeth. ","And he took the damsel by the hand
 and said unto her
 Talitha cumi; which is
 being interpreted
 Damsel
 I say unto thee
 arise. ","But Jesus said unto them
 A prophet is not without honour
 but in his own country
 and among his own kin
 and in his own house. ","And he called unto him the twelve
 and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits; ","And he said unto them
 In what place soever ye enter into an house
 there abide till ye depart from that place. ","And whosoever shall not receive you
 nor hear you
 when ye depart thence
 shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them. Verily I say unto you
 It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment
 than for that city. ","But when Herod heard thereof
 he said
 It is John
 whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead.","and when the daughter of the said Herodias came in
 and danced
 and pleased Herod and them that sat with him
 the king said unto the damsel
 Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt
 and I will give it thee. ","And she went forth
 and said unto her mother
 What shall I ask? And she said
 The head of John the Baptist. ","And he said unto them
 Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place
 and rest a while: for there were many coming and going
 and they had no leisure so much as to eat. ","He answered and said unto them
 Give ye them to eat. And they say unto him
 Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread
 and give them to eat? ","He saith unto them
 How many loaves have ye? go and see. And when they knew
 they say
 Five
 and two fishes. ","for they all saw him
 and were troubled. And immediately he talked with them
 and saith unto them
 Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid. ","He answered and said unto them
 Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites
 as it is written
 This people honoureth me with their lips
 but their heart is far from me. ","Howbeit in vain do they worship me
 teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. ","For laying aside the commandment of God
 ye hold the tradition of men
 as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do.","And he said unto them
 Full well ye reject the commandment of God
 that ye may keep your own tradition. ","For Moses said
 Honour thy father and thy mother; and
 Whoso curseth father or mother
 let him die the death: ","But ye say
 If a man shall say to his father or mother
 It is Corban
 that is to say
 a gift
 by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; he shall be free. ","And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother;","making the word of God of none effect through your tradition
 which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye.","And when he had called all the people unto him
 he said unto them
 Hearken unto me every one of you
 and understand: ","There is nothing from without a man
 that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him
 those are they that defile the man. ","And he saith unto them
 Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive
 that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man
 it cannot defile him; ","because it entereth not into his heart
 but into the belly
 and goeth out into the draught
 purging all meats? ","And he said
 That which cometh out of the man
 that defileth the man. ","For from within
 out of the heart of men
 proceed evil thoughts
 adulteries
 fornications
 murders
 ","thefts
 covetousness
 wickedness
 deceit
 lasciviousness
 an evil eye
 blasphemy
 pride
 foolishness: ","all these evil things come from within
 and defile the man.","But Jesus said unto her
 Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children\u2019s bread
 and to cast it unto the dogs. ","And he said unto her
 For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter. ","and looking up to heaven
 he sighed
 and saith unto him
 Ephphatha
 that is
 Be opened. ","In those days the multitude being very great
 and having nothing to eat
 Jesus called his disciples unto him
 and saith unto them
 ","I have compassion on the multitude
 because they have now been with me three days
 and have nothing to eat: ","and if I send them away fasting to their own houses
 they will faint by the way: for divers of them came from far. ","And he asked them
 How many loaves have ye? And they said
 Seven. ","And he sighed deeply in his spirit
 and saith
 Why doth this generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you
 There shall no sign be given unto this generation. ","And he charged them
 saying
 Take heed
 beware of the leaven of the Pharisees
 and of the leaven of Herod. ","And when Jesus knew it
 he saith unto them
 Why reason ye
 because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet
 neither understand? have ye your heart yet hardened? ","Having eyes
 see ye not? and having ears
 hear ye not? and do ye not remember? ","When I brake the five loaves among five thousand
 how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say unto him
 Twelve. ","And when the seven among four thousand
 how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? And they said
 Seven. ","And he said unto them
 How is it that ye do not understand?","And he took the blind man by the hand
 and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes
 and put his hands upon him
 he asked him if he saw ought. ","And he sent him away to his house
 saying
 Neither go into the town
 nor tell it to any in the town.","And Jesus went out
 and his disciples
 into the towns of C\u00e6sarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples
 saying unto them
 Whom do men say that I am? ","And he saith unto them
 But whom say ye that I am? And Peter answereth and saith unto him
 Thou art the Christ. ","But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples
 he rebuked Peter
 saying
 Get thee behind me
 Satan: for thou savourest not the things that be of God
 but the things that be of men.","And when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also
 he said unto them
 Whosoever will come after me
 let him deny himself
 and take up his cross
 and follow me. ","For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel\u2019s
 the same shall save it. ","For what shall it profit a man
 if he shall gain the whole world
 and lose his own soul? ","Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?","Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed
 when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.","And he said unto them
 Verily I say unto you
 That there be some of them that stand here
 which shall not taste of death
 till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power.","And Peter answered and said to Jesus
 Master
 it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee
 and one for Moses
 and one for Elias. ","And he answered and told them
 Elias verily cometh first
 and restoreth all things; and how it is written of the Son of man
 that he must suffer many things
 and be set at nought. ","But I say unto you
 That Elias is indeed come
 and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed
 as it is written of him.","And he asked the scribes
 What question ye with them? ","He answereth him
 and saith
 O faithless generation
 how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him unto me. ","And he asked his father
 How long is it ago since this came unto him? And he said
 Of a child. ","Jesus said unto him
 If thou canst believe
 all things are possible to him that believeth. ","When Jesus saw that the people came running together
 he rebuked the foul spirit
 saying unto him
 Thou dumb and deaf spirit
 I charge thee
 come out of him
 and enter no more into him. ","And he said unto them
 This kind can come forth by nothing
 but by prayer and fasting.","For he taught his disciples
 and said unto them
 The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men
 and they shall kill him; and after that he is killed
 he shall rise the third day. ","And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked them
 What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way? ","And he sat down
 and called the twelve
 and saith unto them
 If any man desire to be first
 the same shall be last of all
 and servant of all. ","And he took a child
 and set him in the midst of them: and when he had taken him in his arms
 he said unto them
 ","But Jesus said
 Forbid him not: for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name
 that can lightly speak evil of me. ","For he that is not against us is on our part.","For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name
 because ye belong to Christ
 verily I say unto you
 he shall not lose his reward. ","And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me
 it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck
 and he were cast into the sea. ","And if thy hand offend thee
 cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed
 than having two hands to go into hell
 into the fire that never shall be quenched: ","And if thy foot offend thee
 cut it off: it is better for thee to enter halt into life
 than having two feet to be cast into hell
 into the fire that never shall be quenched: ","And if thine eye offend thee
 pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye
 than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire: ","where their worm dieth not
 and the fire is not quenched. ","For every one shall be salted with fire
 and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt. ","Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his saltness
 wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves
 and have peace one with another.","And he answered and said unto them
 What did Moses command you? ","And Jesus answered and said unto them
 For the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept. ","But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female.","For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother
 and cleave to his wife; ","and they twain shall be one flesh: so then they are no more twain
 but one flesh. ","What therefore God hath joined together
 let not man put asunder. ","And he saith unto them
 Whosoever shall put away his wife
 and marry another
 committeth adultery against her. ","And if a woman shall put away her husband
 and be married to another
 she committeth adultery.","But when Jesus saw it
 he was much displeased
 and said unto them
 Suffer the little children to come unto me
 and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God. ","Verily I say unto you
 Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child
 he shall not enter therein. ","And Jesus said unto him
 Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one
 that is
 God. ","Thou knowest the commandments
 Do not commit adultery
 Do not kill
 Do not steal
 Do not bear false witness
 Defraud not
 Honour thy father and mother. ","And he answered and said unto him
 Master
 all these have I observed from my youth. ","Then Jesus beholding him loved him
 and said unto him
 One thing thou lackest: go thy way
 sell whatsoever thou hast
 and give to the poor
 and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come
 take up the cross
 and follow me. ","And Jesus looked round about
 and saith unto his disciples
 How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God! ","And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus answereth again
 and saith unto them
 Children
 how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God! ","It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle
 than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. ","And they were astonished out of measure
 saying among themselves
 Who then can be saved? ","And Jesus looking upon them saith
 With men it is impossible
 but not with God: for with God all things are possible.","And Jesus answered and said
 Verily I say unto you
 There is no man that hath left house
 or brethren
 or sisters
 or father
 or mother
 or wife
 or children
 or lands
 for my sake
 and the gospel\u2019s
 ","but he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time
 houses
 and brethren
 and sisters
 and mothers
 and children
 and lands
 with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life. ","But many that are first shall be last; and the last first.","saying
 Behold
 we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests
 and unto the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death
 and shall deliver him to the Gentiles: ","and they shall mock him
 and shall scourge him
 and shall spit upon him
 and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again.","And James and John
 the sons of Zebedee
 come unto him
 saying
 Master
 we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire. ","And he said unto them
 What would ye that I should do for you? ","But Jesus said unto them
 Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? ","And they said unto him
 We can. And Jesus said unto them
 Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized: ","but to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared.","But Jesus called them to him
 and saith unto them
 Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them. ","But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great among you
 shall be your minister: ","and whosoever of you will be the chiefest
 shall be servant of all. ","For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto
 but to minister
 and to give his life a ransom for many.","And Jesus stood still
 and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man
 saying unto him
 Be of good comfort
 rise; he calleth thee. ","And Jesus answered and said unto him
 What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him
 Lord
 that I might receive my sight. ","And Jesus said unto him
 Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight
 and followed Jesus in the way.","and saith unto them
 Go your way into the village over against you: and as soon as ye be entered into it
 ye shall find a colt tied
 whereon never man sat; loose him
 and bring him. ","And if any man say unto you
 Why do ye this? say ye that the Lord hath need of him; and straightway he will send him hither. ","And Jesus answered and said unto it
 No man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever. And his disciples heard it.","And he taught
 saying unto them
 Is it not written
 My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer? but ye have made it a den of thieves. ","And Jesus answering saith unto them
 Have faith in God. ","For verily I say unto you
 That whosoever shall say unto this mountain
 Be thou removed
 and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart
 but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith. ","Therefore I say unto you
 What things soever ye desire
 when ye pray
 believe that ye receive them
 and ye shall have them. ","And when ye stand praying
 forgive
 if ye have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses. ","And Jesus answered and said unto them
 I will also ask of you one question
 and answer me
 and I will tell you by what authority I do these things. ","The baptism of John
 was it from heaven
 or of men? answer me. ","And they answered and said unto Jesus
 We cannot tell. And Jesus answering saith unto them
 Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.","And he began to speak unto them by parables. A certain man planted a vineyard
 and set an hedge about it
 and digged a place for the winefat
 and built a tower
 and let it out to husbandmen
 and went into a far country. ","And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant
 that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard. ","And they caught him
 and beat him
 and sent him away empty. ","And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast stones
 and wounded him in the head
 and sent him away shamefully handled. ","And again he sent another; and him they killed
 and many others; beating some
 and killing some. ","Having yet therefore one son
 his wellbeloved
 he sent him also last unto them
 saying
 They will reverence my son. ","But those husbandmen said among themselves
 This is the heir; come
 let us kill him
 and the inheritance shall be ours. ","And they took him
 and killed him
 and cast him out of the vineyard. ","What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen
 and will give the vineyard unto others. ","And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner:","this was the Lord\u2019s doing
 and it is marvellous in our eyes? ","And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians
 to catch him in his words. ","Shall we give
 or shall we not give? But he
 knowing their hypocrisy
 said unto them
 Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny
 that I may see it. ","And they brought it. And he saith unto them
 Whose is this image and superscription? And they said unto him
 C\u00e6sar\u2019s. ","And Jesus answering said unto them
 Render to C\u00e6sar the things that are C\u00e6sar\u2019s
 and to God the things that are God\u2019s. And they marvelled at him.","And Jesus answering said unto them
 Do ye not therefore err
 because ye know not the scriptures
 neither the power of God? ","For when they shall rise from the dead
 they neither marry
 nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven. ","And as touching the dead
 that they rise: have ye not read in the book of Moses
 how in the bush God spake unto him
 saying
 I am the God of Abraham
 and the God of Isaac
 and the God of Jacob? ","He is not the God of the dead
 but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err.","And one of the scribes came
 and having heard them reasoning together
 and perceiving that he had answered them well
 asked him
 Which is the first commandment of all? ","And Jesus answered him
 The first of all the commandments is
 Hear
 O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord: ","and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart
 and with all thy soul
 and with all thy mind
 and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment. ","And the second is like
 namely this
 Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these. ","And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly
 he said unto him
 Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him any question.","And Jesus answered and said
 while he taught in the temple
 How say the scribes that Christ is the Son of David? ","For David himself said by the Holy Ghost
 The Lord said to my Lord
 Sit thou on my right hand
 till I make thine enemies thy footstool. ","David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he then his son? And the common people heard him gladly.","And he said unto them in his doctrine
 Beware of the scribes
 which love to go in long clothing
 and love salutations in the marketplaces
 ","and the chief seats in the synagogues
 and the uppermost rooms at feasts: ","which devour widows\u2019 houses
 and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation.","And he called unto him his disciples
 and saith unto them
 Verily I say unto you
 That this poor widow hath cast more in
 than all they which have cast into the treasury: ","for all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had
 even all her living.","And as he went out of the temple
 one of his disciples saith unto him
 Master
 see what manner of stones and what buildings are here! ","And Jesus answering said unto him
 Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another
 that shall not be thrown down. ","And Jesus answering them began to say
 Take heed lest any man deceive you: ","for many shall come in my name
 saying
 I am Christ; and shall deceive many. ","And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars
 be ye not troubled: for such things must needs be; but the end shall not be yet. ","For nation shall rise against nation
 and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places
 and there shall be famines and troubles: these are the beginnings of sorrows.","But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake
 for a testimony against them. ","And the gospel must first be published among all nations.","But when they shall lead you
 and deliver you up
 take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak
 neither do ye premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour
 that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak
 but the Holy Ghost. ","Now the brother shall betray the brother to death
 and the father the son; and children shall rise up against their parents
 and shall cause them to be put to death. ","And ye shall be hated of all men for my name\u2019s sake: but he that shall endure unto the end
 the same shall be saved.","But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation
 spoken of by Daniel the prophet
 standing where it ought not
 (let him that readeth understand
) then let them that be in Jud\u00e6a flee to the mountains: ","and let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house
 neither enter therein
 to take any thing out of his house: ","and let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment.","But woe to them that are with child
 and to them that give suck in those days! ","And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter.","For in those days shall be affliction
 such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created unto this time
 neither shall be. ","And except that the Lord had shortened those days
 no flesh should be saved: but for the elect\u2019s sake
 whom he hath chosen
 he hath shortened the days. ","And then if any man shall say to you
 Lo
 here is Christ; or
 lo
 he is there; believe him not: ","for false Christs and false prophets shall rise
 and shall shew signs and wonders
 to seduce
 if it were possible
 even the elect. ","But take ye heed: behold
 I have foretold you all things.","But in those days
 after that tribulation
 the sun shall be darkened
 and the moon shall not give her light
 ","and the stars of heaven shall fall
 and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken. ","And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.","And then shall he send his angels
 and shall gather together his elect from the four winds
 from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven.","Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When her branch is yet tender
 and putteth forth leaves
 ye know that summer is near: ","so ye in like manner
 when ye shall see these things come to pass
 know that it is nigh
 even at the doors. ","Verily I say unto you
 that this generation shall not pass
 till all these things be done. ","Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.","But of that day and that hour knoweth no man
 no
 not the angels which are in heaven
 neither the Son
 but the Father. ","Take ye heed
 watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is. ","For the Son of man is as a man taking a far journey
 who left his house
 and gave authority to his servants
 and to every man his work
 and commanded the porter to watch. ","Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh
 at even
 or at midnight
 or at the cockcrowing
 or in the morning: ","lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.","And what I say unto you I say unto all
 Watch.","And there were some that had indignation within themselves
 and said
 Why was this waste of the ointment made? ","And Jesus said
 Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me. ","For ye have the poor with you always
 and whensoever ye will ye may do them good: but me ye have not always. ","She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying.","Verily I say unto you
 Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world
 this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.","And he sendeth forth two of his disciples
 and saith unto them
 Go ye into the city
 and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him. ","And wheresoever he shall go in
 say ye to the goodman of the house
 The Master saith
 Where is the guestchamber
 where I shall eat the passover with my disciples? ","And he will shew you a large upper room furnished and prepared: there make ready for us.","And as they sat and did eat
 Jesus said
 Verily I say unto you
 One of you which eateth with me shall betray me. ","And he answered and said unto them
 It is one of the twelve
 that dippeth with me in the dish. ","The Son of man indeed goeth
 as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had never been born.","And as they did eat
 Jesus took bread
 and blessed
 and brake it
 and gave to them
 and said
 Take
 eat: this is my body. ","And he said unto them
 This is my blood of the new testament
 which is shed for many. ","Verily I say unto you
 I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine
 until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God.","And Jesus saith unto them
 All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written
 I will smite the shepherd
 and the sheep shall be scattered. ","But after that I am risen
 I will go before you into Galilee. ","And Jesus saith unto him
 Verily I say unto thee
 That this day
 even in this night
 before the cock crow twice
 thou shalt deny me thrice. ","And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples
 Sit ye here
 while I shall pray. ","and saith unto them
 My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: tarry ye here
 and watch. ","And he said
 Abba
 Father
 all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will
 but what thou wilt.","And he cometh
 and findeth them sleeping
 and saith unto Peter
 Simon
 sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour? ","Watch ye and pray
 lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready
 but the flesh is weak.","And he cometh the third time
 and saith unto them
 Sleep on now
 and take your rest: it is enough
 the hour is come; behold
 the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. ","Rise up
 let us go; lo
 he that betrayeth me is at hand.","And Jesus answered and said unto them
 Are ye come out
 as against a thief
 with swords and with staves to take me? ","I was daily with you in the temple teaching
 and ye took me not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled. ","And Jesus said
 I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power
 and coming in the clouds of heaven. ","And some began to spit on him
 and to cover his face
 and to buffet him
 and to say unto him
 Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands.","And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him
 Before the cock crow twice
 thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon
 he wept.","And Pilate asked him
 Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto him
 Thou sayest it. ","But Pilate answered them
 saying
 Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews? ","And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice
 saying
 Eloi
 Eloi
 lama sabachthani? which is
 being interpreted
 My God
 my God
 why hast thou forsaken me? ","And when the centurion
 which stood over against him
 saw that he so cried out
 and gave up the ghost
 he said
 Truly this man was the Son of God.","And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto him the centurion
 he asked him whether he had been any while dead. ","And they said among themselves
 Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre? ","And he saith unto them
 Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth
 which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him. ","And he said unto them
 Go ye into all the world
 and preach the gospel to every creature. ","He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.","And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;","they shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing
 it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick
 and they shall recover.","The beginning of the [facts regarding the] good news of Jesus Christ
 the Son of God.","and saying
 \u201cThe [appointed period of] time is fulfilled
 and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent [change your inner self\u2014your old way of thinking
 regret past sins
 live your life in a way that proves repentance; seek God\u2019s purpose for your life] and believe [with a deep
 abiding trust] in the good news [regarding salvation].\u201d","And Jesus said to them
 \u201cFollow Me [as My disciples
 accepting Me as your Master and Teacher and walking the same path of life that I walk]
 and I will make you fishers of men.\u201d ","Jesus rebuked him
 saying
 \u201cBe quiet (muzzled
 silenced)
 and come out of him!\u201d ","and they found Him and said
 \u201cEverybody is looking for You!\u201d ","He replied
 \u201cLet us go on to the neighboring towns
 so I may preach there also; that is why I came [from the Father].\u201d ","Moved with compassion [for his suffering]
 Jesus reached out with His hand and touched him
 and said to him
 \u201cI am willing; be cleansed.\u201d ","saying to him
 \u201cSee that you tell no one anything [about this]; but go
 show yourself to the priest and offer for your purification what Moses commanded
 as proof to them [that you are really healed].\u201d ","When Jesus saw their  faith [springing from confidence in Him]
 He said to the paralyzed man
 \u201cSon
 your sins are forgiven.\u201d ","Immediately Jesus
 being fully aware [of their hostility] and knowing in His spirit that they were thinking this
 said to them
 \u201cWhy are you debating and arguing about these things in your hearts? ","Which is easier
 to say to the paralyzed man
 \u2018Your sins are forgiven\u2019; or to say
 \u2018Get up
 and pick up your mat and walk\u2019? ","But so that you may know that the Son of Man has the authority and power on earth to forgive sins\u201d\u2014He said to the paralyzed man
 ","\u201cI say to you
 get up
 pick up your mat and go home.\u201d ","As He was passing by
 He saw Levi (Matthew) the son of Alphaeus sitting in the tax collector\u2019s booth
 and He said to him
 \u201cFollow Me [as My disciple
 accepting Me as your Master and Teacher and walking the same path of life that I walk].\u201d And he got up and followed Him [becoming His disciple
 believing and trusting in Him and following His example].","When Jesus heard this
 He said to them
 \u201cThose who are healthy have no need of a physician
 but  those who are sick; I did not come to call the righteous
 but sinners [who recognize their sin and humbly seek forgiveness].\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cThe attendants of the bridegroom cannot fast while the bridegroom is  with them
 can they? As long as they have the bridegroom with them
 they cannot fast. ","But the days will come when the bridegroom is  taken away from them
 and they will fast at that time.","\u201cNo one sews a patch of unshrunk (new) cloth on an old garment; otherwise the patch pulls away from it
 the new from the old
 and the tear becomes worse. ","No one puts new wine into old wineskins; otherwise the  wine will [expand and] burst the skins
 and the wine is lost as well as the wineskins. But new wine must be put into new wineskins.\u201d","The Pharisees said to Him
 \u201cLook
 why are they doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cHave you never read [in the Scriptures] what David did when he was in need and was hungry
 he and his companions; ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cThe Sabbath was made for man
 not man for the Sabbath. ","So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath [and He has authority over it].\u201d","He said to the man whose hand was withered
 \u201cGet up and come forward!\u201d ","He asked them
 \u201cIs it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil
 to save a life or to kill?\u201d But they kept silent. ","After looking around at them with anger
 grieved at the hardness and arrogance of their hearts
 He told the man
 \u201cHold out your hand.\u201d And he held it out
 and his hand was  restored. ","So He called them to Himself and spoke to them in parables
 \u201cHow can Satan drive out Satan? ","If a kingdom is divided [split into factions and rebelling] against itself
 that kingdom cannot stand. ","And if a house is divided against itself
 that house cannot stand. ","And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided
 he cannot stand
 but is coming to an end. ","But no one can go into a strong man\u2019s house and steal his property unless he first overpowers and ties up the strong man
 and then he will ransack and rob his house.","\u201cI assure you and most solemnly say to you
 all sins will be forgiven the sons of men
 and all the abusive and blasphemous things they say; ","but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit and His power [by attributing the miracles done by Me to Satan] never has forgiveness
 but is guilty of an everlasting sin [a sin which is unforgivable in this present age as well as in the age to come]\u201d\u2014 ","A crowd was sitting around Him
 and they said to Him
 \u201cLook! Your mother and Your brothers are outside asking for You.\u201d ","And He replied
 \u201cWho are My mother and My brothers?\u201d ","Looking at those who were sitting in a circle around Him
 He said
 \u201cHere are My mother and My brothers! ","For whoever does the will of God [by believing in Me
 and following Me]
 he is My brother and sister and mother.\u201d","And He taught them many things in parables
 and in His teaching He said to them
 ","\u201cListen! A sower went out to sow seed;","and as he was sowing
 some seed fell by the road
 and the birds came and ate it up. ","Other seed fell on rocks where there was not much soil; and immediately a plant sprang up because the soil had no depth.","And when the sun came up
 the plant was scorched; and because it had no root
 it dried up and withered away. ","Other seed fell among thorns
 and the thorns came up and choked it
 and it yielded no grain. ","And other seed fell into good soil
 and as the plants grew and increased
 they yielded a crop and produced thirty
 sixty
 and a hundred times [as much as had been sown].\u201d ","And He said
 \u201cHe who has ears to hear
 let him hear and heed My words.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cThe mystery of the kingdom of God has been given to you [who have teachable hearts]
 but those who are outside [the unbelievers
 the spiritually blind] get everything in parables
 ","so that they will continually look but not see
 and they will continually hear but not understand
 otherwise they might turn [from their rejection of the truth] and be forgiven.\u201d","Then He said to them
 \u201cDo you not understand this parable? How will you understand and grasp the meaning of all the parables? ","The sower sows the word [of God
 the good news regarding the way of salvation]. ","These [in the first group] are the ones along the road where the word is sown; but when they hear
 Satan immediately comes and takes away the word which has been sown in them. ","In a similar way these [in the second group] are the ones on whom seed was sown on rocky ground
 who
 when they hear the word
 immediately receive it with joy [but accept it only superficially]; ","and they have no real root in themselves
 so they endure only for a little while; then
 when trouble or persecution comes because of the word
 immediately they [are offended and displeased at being associated with Me and] stumble and fall away. ","And others are the ones on whom seed was sown among the thorns; these are the ones who have heard the word
 ","but the worries and cares of the world [the distractions of this age with its worldly pleasures]
 and the deceitfulness [and the false security or glamour] of wealth [or fame]
 and the passionate desires for all the other things creep in and choke out the word
 and it becomes unfruitful. ","And those [in the last group] are the ones on whom seed was sown on the good soil; and they hear the word [of God
 the good news regarding the way of salvation] and accept it and bear fruit\u2014thirty
 sixty
 and a hundred times as much [as was sown].\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cA lamp is not brought in to be put under a basket or under a bed
 is it? Is it not [brought in] to be put on the lampstand? ","For nothing is hidden
 except to be revealed; nor has anything been kept secret
 but that it would come to light [that is
 things are hidden only temporarily
 until the appropriate time comes for them to be known]. ","If anyone has ears to hear
 let him hear and heed My words.\u201d ","Then He said to them
 \u201cPay attention to what you hear. By your own standard of measurement [that is
 to the extent that you study spiritual truth and apply godly wisdom] it will be measured to you [and you will be given even greater ability to respond]\u2014and more will be given to you besides. ","For whoever has [a teachable heart]
 to him more  will be given; and whoever does not have [a yearning for truth]
 even what he has will be taken away from him.\u201d","Then He said
 \u201cThe kingdom of God is like a man who throws seed on the ground; ","and he goes to bed at night and gets up every day
 and [in the meantime] the seed sprouts and grows; how [it does this]
 he does not know. ","The earth produces crops by itself; first the blade
 then the head [of grain]
 then the mature grain in the head. ","But when the crop ripens
 he immediately puts in the sickle [to reap]
 because [the time for] the harvest has come.\u201d","And He said
 \u201cHow shall we picture the kingdom of God
 or what parable shall we use to illustrate and explain it? ","It is like a mustard seed
 which
 when it is sown on the ground
 even though it is smaller than all the  seeds that are  on the soil
 ","yet when it is sown
 it grows up and becomes larger than all the garden herbs; and it puts out large branches
 so that the birds of the sky are able to make nests and live under its shade.\u201d","On that  day
 when evening had come
 He said to them
 \u201cLet us go over to the other side [of the Sea of Galilee].\u201d ","And He got up and  rebuked the wind and said to the sea
 \u201cHush
 be still (muzzled)!\u201d And the wind died down [as if it had grown weary] and there was [at once] a great calm [a perfect peacefulness]. ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cWhy are you afraid? Do you still have no faith and confidence [in Me]?\u201d ","For Jesus had been saying to him
 \u201cCome out of the man
 you unclean spirit!\u201d ","He was asking him
 \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d And he replied
 \u201cMy name is Legion; for we are many.\u201d ","Jesus did not let him 
 but  He said to him
 \u201cGo home to your family and tell them all the great things that the Lord has done for you
 and how He has had mercy on you.\u201d ","For she thought
 \u201cIf I just touch His clothing
 I will get well.\u201d ","His disciples said to Him
 \u201cYou see the crowd pressing in around You [from all sides]
 and You ask
 \u2018Who touched Me?\u2019\u201d ","Then He said to her
 \u201cDaughter
 your faith [your personal trust and confidence in Me] has restored you to health; go in peace and be  healed from your suffering.\u201d","Overhearing what was being said
 Jesus said to the synagogue official
 \u201cDo not be afraid; only keep on believing [in Me and my power].\u201d ","When He had gone in
 He said to them
 \u201cWhy make a commotion and weep? The child has not died
 but is sleeping.\u201d ","Taking the child\u2019s hand
 He said  to her
 \u201cTalitha kum!\u201d\u2014which translated [from Aramaic] means
 \u201cLittle girl
 I say to you
 get up!\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cA prophet is not without honor (respect) except in his hometown and among his relatives and in his own household.\u201d ","And He called the twelve  and began to send them out [as His special messengers] two by two
 and gave them authority and power over the unclean spirits. ","And He told them
 \u201cWherever you go into a house
 stay there until you leave that town. ","Any place that does not welcome you or listen to you
 when you leave there
 shake the dust off the soles of your feet as a testimony against them [breaking all ties with them because they rejected My message].\u201d ","But when Herod heard [of it]
 he kept saying
 \u201cJohn
 whom I beheaded
 has risen [from the dead]!\u201d","Now  the daughter of Herodias came in and danced [for the men]. She pleased and beguiled Herod and his dinner guests; and the king said to the girl
 \u201cAsk me for whatever you want and I will give it to you.\u201d ","She went out and said to her mother
 \u201cWhat shall I ask for?\u201d And Herodias replied
 \u201cThe head of John the Baptist!\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cCome away by yourselves to a secluded place and rest a little while\u201d\u2014for there were many [people who were continually] coming and going
 and they could not even find time to eat. ","But He replied
 \u201cYou give them something to eat!\u201d And they asked Him
 \u201cShall we go and buy 200 denarii worth of bread and give it to them to eat?\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cHow many loaves do you have? Go look!\u201d And when they found out
 they said
 \u201cFive 
 and two fish.\u201d ","for they all saw Him and were shaken and terrified. But He immediately spoke with them and said
 \u201cTake courage! It is I (I Am)! Stop being afraid.\u201d ","He replied
 \u201cRightly did Isaiah prophesy about you hypocrites (play-actors
 pretenders)
 as it is written [in Scripture]
 \u2018These people honor Me with their lips
 But their heart is far from Me."," \u2018They worship Me in vain [their worship is meaningless and worthless
 a pretense]
 Teaching the precepts of men as doctrines [giving their traditions equal weight with the Scriptures].\u2019","You disregard and neglect the commandment of God
 and cling  to the tradition of men.\u201d","He was also saying to them
 \u201cYou are experts at setting aside and nullifying the commandment of God in order to keep your [man-made] tradition and regulations. ","For Moses said
 \u2018Honor your father and your mother [with respect and gratitude]\u2019; and
 \u2018He who speaks evil of his father or mother must be put to death\u2019; ","but you [Pharisees and scribes] say
 \u2018If a man tells his father or mother
 \u201cWhatever I have that would help you is Corban
 (that is to say
 already a gift to God)
\u201d\u2019 ","then you no longer let him do anything for his father or mother [since helping them would violate his vow of Corban];","so you nullify the [authority of the] word of God [acting as if it did not apply] because of your tradition which you have handed down [through the elders]. And you do many things such as that.\u201d","After He called the people to Him again
 He began saying to them
 \u201cListen  to Me
 all of you
  and understand [what I am saying]: ","there is nothing outside a man [such as food] which by going into him can defile him [morally or spiritually]; but the things which come out of [the heart of] a man are what defile and dishonor him.","And He said to them
 \u201cAre you
 too
 so foolish and lacking in understanding? Do you not understand that whatever goes into the man from outside cannot defile and dishonor him
 ","since it does not enter his heart
 but  his stomach
 and [from there it] is eliminated?\u201d (By this
 He declared all foods ceremonially clean.) ","And He said
 \u201cWhatever comes from [the heart of] a man
 that is what defiles and dishonors him. ","For from within
 [that is] out the heart of men
 come base and malevolent thoughts and schemes
 acts of sexual immorality
 thefts
 murders
 adulteries
 ","acts of greed and covetousness
 wickedness
 deceit
 unrestrained conduct
 envy and jealousy
 slander and profanity
 arrogance and self-righteousness and foolishness (poor judgment). ","All these evil things [schemes and desires] come from within and defile and dishonor the man.\u201d","He was saying to her
 \u201cFirst let the children [of Israel] be fed
 for it is not right to take the children\u2019s bread and throw it to the pet dogs (non-Jews).\u201d ","And He said to her
 \u201cBecause of this answer [reflecting your humility and faith]
 go [knowing that your request is granted]; the demon has left your daughter .\u201d ","and looking up to heaven
 He sighed deeply and said to the man
 \u201cEphphatha
\u201d which [in Aramaic] means
 \u201cBe opened and released!\u201d ","In those days
 when there was again a large crowd [gathered before Him] and they had nothing to eat
 Jesus called His disciples and told them
 ","\u201cI feel compassion for the crowd; they have been with Me now for three days and have nothing  to eat.","If I send them away to their homes hungry
 they will faint [from exhaustion] on the road; because some of them have come a long way.\u201d ","He asked them
 \u201cHow many loaves [of bread] do you have?\u201d They said
 \u201cSeven.\u201d ","He groaned and sighed deeply in His spirit and said
 \u201cWhy does this generation demand a sign? I assure you and most solemnly say to you
 no sign will be given to this generation!\u201d ","Jesus repeatedly ordered them
 saying
 \u201cWatch out! Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.\u201d ","Jesus
 aware of this 
 said to them
 \u201cWhy are you discussing [the fact] that you have no bread? Do you still not see or understand? Are your hearts hardened? ","Though you have eyes
 do you not see? And though you have ears
 do you not hear and listen [to what I have said]? And do you not remember
 ","when I broke the five loaves for the five thousand
 how many baskets full of broken pieces you picked up?\u201d They answered
 \u201cTwelve.\u201d ","\u201cAnd [when I broke] the seven  for the four thousand
 how many large baskets full of broken pieces did you pick up?\u201d And they answered
 \u201cSeven.\u201d ","And He was saying to them
 \u201cDo you still not understand?\u201d","Taking the blind man by the hand
 He led him out of the village; and after spitting on his eyes and laying His hands on him
 He asked him
 \u201cDo you see anything?\u201d ","And He sent him to his home
 saying
 \u201cDo not even enter the village.\u201d","Then Jesus and His disciples went out to the villages of Caesarea Philippi; and on the way He asked His disciples
 \u201cWho do people say that I am?\u201d ","And He asked them
 \u201cBut who do you say that I am?\u201d Peter replied to Him
 \u201cYou [in contrast to the others] are the Christ (the Messiah
 the Anointed).\u201d ","But turning around [with His back to Peter] and seeing His disciples
 He rebuked Peter
 saying
 \u201cGet behind Me
 Satan; for your mind is not set on God\u2019s will or His values and purposes
 but on what pleases man.\u201d","Jesus called the crowd together with His disciples
 and said to them
 \u201cIf anyone wishes to follow Me [as My disciple]
 he must deny himself [set aside selfish interests]
 and take up his cross [expressing a willingness to endure whatever may come] and follow Me [believing in Me
 conforming to My example in living and
 if need be
 suffering or perhaps dying because of faith in Me]. ","For whoever wishes to save his life [in this world] will  lose it [through death]
 but whoever loses his life [in this world] for My sake and the gospel\u2019s will save it [from the consequences of sin and separation from God]. ","For what does it benefit a man to gain the whole world [with all its pleasures]
 and forfeit his soul? ","For what will a man give in exchange for his soul and eternal life [in God\u2019s kingdom]?","For whoever is ashamed [here and now] of Me and My words in this adulterous and sinful generation
 the Son of Man will also be ashamed of him when He comes in the glory of His Father with the holy angels.\u201d","And Jesus said to them
 \u201cI assure you and most solemnly say to you
 there are some of those who are standing here who will not taste (experience) death before they see the kingdom of God after it has come with power.\u201d","Peter responded and said to Jesus
 \u201cRabbi (Master)
 it is good for us to be here; let us make three  tents\u2014one for You
 and one for Moses
 and one for Elijah.\u201d ","He answered them
 \u201cElijah does come first and restores and reestablishes all things. And yet how is it written of the Son of Man that He will suffer many things [grief and physical distress] and be treated with contempt [utterly despised and rejected]? ","But I say to you that Elijah has in fact come 
 and they did to him whatever they wished

 \u201cWhat are you discussing with them?\u201d ","He replied
 \u201cO unbelieving (faithless) generation

 \u201cHow long has this been happening to him?\u201d And he answered
 \u201cSince childhood. ","Jesus said to him
 \u201c[You say to Me
] \u2018If You can?\u2019 All things are possible for the one who believes and trusts [in Me]!\u201d ","When Jesus saw that a crowd was rapidly gathering [around them]
 He rebuked the unclean spirit
 saying to it
 \u201cYou deaf and mute spirit
 I command you
 come out of him and never enter him again!\u201d ","He replied to them
 \u201cThis kind [of unclean spirit] cannot come out by anything but prayer [to the Father].\u201d","because He was teaching His disciples [and preparing them for the future]. He told them

 He called the twelve  and said to them
 \u201cIf anyone wants to be first
 he must be last of all [in importance] and a servant of all.\u201d ","Taking a child
 He set him before them; and taking him in His arms
 He said to them
 ","But Jesus said
 \u201cDo not stop him; for there is no one who will perform a miracle in My name
 and be able soon afterward to speak evil of Me. ","For he who is not against us is for us.","For whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because of your name as followers of Christ
 I assure you and most solemnly say to you
 he will not lose his reward.","\u201cBut whoever causes one of these little ones who believe and trust in Me to stumble [that is
 to sin or lose faith]
 it would be better for him if a heavy millstone [one requiring a donkey\u2019s strength to turn it] were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea. ","If your hand causes you to stumble and sin
 cut it off [that is
 remove yourself from the source of temptation]! It is better for you to enter life crippled
 than to have two hands and go into hell
 into the unquenchable fire
 ","If your foot causes you to stumble and sin
 cut it off [that is
 remove yourself from the source of temptation]! It would be better for you to enter life lame than to have two feet and be thrown into hell
 ","If your eye causes you to stumble and sin
 throw it out [that is
 remove yourself from the source of temptation]! It would be better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye
 than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell
 ","where their worm [that feeds on the dead] does not die
 and the fire is not put out.","\u201cFor everyone will be salted with fire.","Salt is good and useful; but if salt has lost its saltiness (purpose)
 how will you make it salty? Have salt within yourselves continually
 and be at peace with one another.\u201d","He replied to them
 \u201cWhat did Moses command you?\u201d ","But Jesus said to them
 \u201cBecause of your hardness of hearts [your callousness and insensitivity toward your wives and the provision of God] he wrote you this precept. ","But from the beginning of creation God made them male and female.","For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother [to establish a home with his wife]
 ","and the two shall become one flesh; so that they are no longer two
 but [are united as] one flesh. ","Therefore
 what God has united and joined together
 man must not separate [by divorce].\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cWhoever divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her; ","and if a woman divorces her husband and marries another man
 she commits adultery.\u201d","But when Jesus saw this
 He was indignant and He said to them
 \u201cAllow the children to come to Me; do not forbid them; for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. ","I assure you and most solemnly say to you
 whoever does not receive and welcome the kingdom of God like a child will not enter it at all.\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cWhy do you call Me good? No one is  good [by nature] except God alone. ","You know the commandments: \u2018Do not murder
 Do not commit adultery
 Do not steal
 Do not testify falsely

 \u201cTeacher
 I have  kept all these  since my youth.\u201d ","Looking at him
 Jesus felt a love (high regard
 compassion) for him

 \u201cYou lack one thing: go and sell all your property and give [the money] to the poor
 and you will have  treasure in heaven; and come
 follow Me [becoming My disciple
 believing and trusting in Me and walking the same path of life that I walk].\u201d ","Jesus looked around and said to His disciples
 \u201cHow difficult it will be for those who are wealthy [and cling to possessions and status as security] to enter the kingdom of God!\u201d ","The disciples were amazed and bewildered by His words. But Jesus said to them again
 \u201cChildren
 how difficult it is [for those who place their hope and confidence in riches] to enter the kingdom of God! ","It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man [who places his faith in wealth or status] to enter the kingdom of God.\u201d","They were completely and utterly astonished
 and said to Him
 \u201cThen who can be saved [from the wrath of God]?\u201d ","Looking at them
 Jesus said
 \u201cWith people [as far as it depends on them] it is impossible
 but not with God; for all things are possible with God.\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cI assure you and most solemnly say to you
 there is no one who has given up a house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or farms
 for My sake and for the gospel\u2019s sake
 ","who will not receive a hundred times as much now in the present age\u2014houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and farms\u2014along with persecutions; and in the age to come

 first.\u201d","saying
 \u201cListen very carefully: we are going up to Jerusalem
 and the Son of Man will be betrayed and handed over to the chief priests and the scribes; and they will condemn Him to death and hand Him over to the Gentiles (Romans). ","They will mock and ridicule Him and spit on Him
 and whip (scourge) Him and kill Him

 \u201cWhat do you want Me to do for you?\u201d ","But Jesus said to them
 \u201cYou do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink

 \u201cWe are able.\u201d Jesus told them
 \u201cThe cup that I drink you will drink

 this is not Mine to give; but it is for those for whom it has been prepared [by My Father].\u201d","Calling them to Himself

 \u201cYou know that those who are recognized as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them; and their powerful men exercise authority over them [tyrannizing them]. ","But this is not how it is among you; instead

 \u2018Why are you doing this?\u2019 say
 \u2018The Lord needs it\u2019; and immediately he will send it here.\u201d ","He said to it

 \u201cHave faith in God . ","I assure you and most solemnly say to you

 forgive him [drop the issue

 \u201cI will ask you one question
 and you answer Me

 ordained by God] or from men? Answer Me.\u201d ","So they replied to Jesus
 \u201cWe do not know.\u201d And Jesus said to them
 \u201cNeither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.\u201d","Jesus began to speak to them [the chief priests
 scribes and elders who were questioning Him] in parables: \u201cA man planted a vineyard and put a wall around it
 and dug a pit for the wine press and built a tower; and he rented it out to tenant farmers and left the country. ","When the harvest season came he sent a servant to the tenants
 in order to collect from them some of the fruit of the vineyard. ","They took him and beat him and sent him away empty-handed.","Again he sent them another servant

 a beloved son; he sent him last of all to them

 \u2018They will respect my son.\u2019 ","But those tenants said to each other
 \u2018This man is the heir! Come on
 let us kill him [and destroy the evidence]
 and his inheritance will be ours!\u2019 ","So they took him and killed him
 and threw his body outside the vineyard. ","What will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the tenants
 and will give the vineyard to others. ","Have you not even read this Scripture: \u2018The stone which the builders regarded as unworthy and rejected
 This [very stone] has become the chief Cornerstone"," This came about from the Lord
 And it is marvelous and wonderful in our eyes\u2019?\u201d","Then they sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians to Jesus in order to trap Him into making a statement [that they could use against Him].","Should we pay [the tax] or should we not pay?\u201d But knowing their hypocrisy
 He asked them
 \u201cWhy are you testing Me? Bring Me a coin (denarius) to look at.\u201d ","So they brought one. Then He asked them
 \u201cWhose image and inscription is this?\u201d They said to Him
 \u201cCaesar\u2019s.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cPay to Caesar the things that are Caesar\u2019s

 \u201cIs this not why you are wrong
 because you know neither the Scriptures [that teach the resurrection] nor the power of God [who is able to raise the dead]? ","For when they rise from the dead
 they do not marry nor are they given in marriage
 but are like angels in heaven. ","But concerning the raising of the dead
 have you not read in the book of Moses

 \u2018I am the God of Abraham

 \u201cWhich commandment is first and most important of all?\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cThe first and most important one is: \u2018Hear
 O Israel
 the Lord our God is one Lord; ","and you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart
 and with all your soul (life)
 and with all your mind (thought
 understanding)
 and with all your strength.\u2019 ","This is the second: \u2018You shall  love your neighbor as yourself.\u2019 There is no other commandment greater than these.\u201d","When Jesus saw that he answered thoughtfully and intelligently
 He said to him
 \u201cYou are not far from the kingdom of God.\u201d And after that
 no one would dare to ask Him any more questions.","Jesus began to say
 as He taught in [a portico or court of] the temple
 \u201cHow can the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David? ","David himself said [when inspired] by the Holy Spirit
 \u2018The Lord (the Father) said to my Lord (the Son
 the Messiah)
 \u201cSit at My right hand
 Until I put Your enemies under Your feet.\u201d\u2019","David himself calls Him (the Son
 the Messiah) \u2018Lord\u2019; so how can it be that He is David\u2019s Son?\u201d The large crowd enjoyed hearing Jesus and listened to Him with delight.","In [the course of] His teaching He was saying
 \u201cBeware of the scribes
 who like to walk around in long robes [displaying their prominence]
 and like to receive respectful greetings in the market places
 ","and [they love] the chief seats in the synagogues and the places of distinction and honor at banquets
 ","[these scribes] who devour (confiscate) widows\u2019 houses
 and offer long prayers for appearance\u2019s sake [to impress others]. These men will receive greater condemnation.\u201d","Calling His disciples to Him
 He said to them
 \u201cI assure you and most solemnly say to you
 this poor widow put in  more than all the contributors to the treasury. ","For they all contributed from their surplus
 but she
 from her poverty
 put in all she had
 all she had to live on.\u201d","As He was coming out of the temple 
 one of His disciples said to Him
 \u201cTeacher
 look what wonderful stones and what wonderful buildings!\u201d ","Jesus replied to him
 \u201cYou see these great buildings? Not one stone will be left on another which will not be torn down!\u201d","Jesus began to say to them
 \u201cBe careful and see to it that no one misleads you. ","Many will come in My name [misusing My name or claiming to be the Messiah]
 saying
 \u2018I am He!\u2019 and will deceive and mislead many. ","When you hear of wars and rumors of wars
 do not be alarmed (frightened
 troubled); these things must take place
 but the end is not yet. ","For nation will rise up against nation
 and kingdom against kingdom; there will be earthquakes in various places; there will be famines. These things are the beginning of the birth pangs [the intolerable anguish and suffering].","\u201cBut be on your guard; they will turn you over to courts
 and you will be beaten in synagogues
 and you will stand [as accused] before governors and kings for My sake
 as a testimony to them. ","The gospel [that is
 the good news regarding the way of salvation] must first be preached to all the  nations. ","When they take you and turn you over [to the court]
 do not worry beforehand about what to say
 but say whatever is given to you [by God] in that hour; for it is not you who speak
 but it is the Holy Spirit [who will speak through you]. ","Brother will betray brother to [be put to] death
 and a father [will hand over] his child; and children will rise up and take a stand against parents and have them put to death. ","You will be hated by everyone because of [your association with] My name
 but the one who [patiently perseveres empowered by the Holy Spirit and] endures to the end
 he will be saved.","\u201cBut when you see the abomination of desolation standing [in the temple sanctuary] where it ought not to be (let the reader understand) then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains.","Whoever is on the housetop must not go down [to enter the house]
 or go inside to take anything out of his house; ","whoever is in the field must not turn back to get his coat.","And woe to those women who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days!","Pray that it will not occur in winter
 ","for at that time there will be such tribulation as has not occurred
 from the beginning of the creation which God made
 until now\u2014and never will [be again]. ","And if the Lord had not shortened the days
 no human life would have been saved; but for the sake of the elect
 whom He chose [for Himself]
 He shortened the days. ","Then if anyone says to you
 \u2018Look
 here is the Christ (the Messiah
 the Anointed)!\u2019 or
 \u2018Look
 He is there!\u2019 do not believe it; ","for false Christs and false prophets will arise
 and they will provide signs and wonders in order to deceive
 if [such a thing were] possible
 even the elect [those God has chosen for Himself]. ","But be on your guard; I have told you everything in advance.","\u201cBut in those days
 after [the suffering and distress of] that tribulation
 the sun will be darkened
 and the moon will not give its light
 ","and the stars will be falling from the sky
 and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken. ","Then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory [in royal majesty and splendor].","And then He will send out the angels
 and will gather together His elect [those He has chosen for Himself] from the four winds
 from the farthest end of the earth to the farthest end of heaven.","\u201cNow learn this lesson from the fig tree: as soon as its branch becomes tender and it puts out its leaves
 you recognize that summer is near. ","Even so
 you too
 when you see these things happening
 know [for certain] that He is near
 right at the door. ","I assure you and most solemnly say to you
 this generation [the people living when these signs and events begin] will not pass away until all these things take place. ","Heaven and earth [as now known] will pass away
 but My words will not pass away. ","But of that  day or hour no one knows
 not even the angels in heaven
 nor the Son [in His humanity]
 but the Father alone.","\u201cBe on guard and stay constantly alert [and pray]; for you do not know when the appointed time will come.","It is like a man away on a journey
 who when he left home put his servants in charge

 be continually on the alert\u2014for you do not know when the master of the house is coming

 that kingdom cannot stand.","And if a house is divided (split into factions and rebelling) against itself
 that house will not be able to last.","And if Satan has raised an insurrection against himself and is divided
 he cannot stand but is [surely] coming to an end.","But no one can go into a strong man\u2019s house and ransack his household goods right and left and seize them as plunder unless he first binds the strong man; then indeed he may [thoroughly] plunder his house.","Truly and solemnly I say to you
 all sins will be forgiven the sons of men
 and whatever abusive and blasphemous things they utter;","But whoever speaks abusively against or maliciously misrepresents the Holy Spirit can never get forgiveness
 but is guilty of and is in the grasp of an everlasting trespass.","And a crowd was sitting around Him
 and they said to Him
 Your mother and Your brothers and Your sisters are outside asking for You.","And He replied
 Who are My mother and My brothers?","And looking around on those who sat in a circle about Him
 He said
 See! Here are My mother and My brothers;","For whoever does the things God wills is My brother and sister and mother!","And He taught them many things in parables (illustrations or comparisons put beside truths to explain them)
 and in His teaching He said to them:","Give attention to this! Behold
 a sower went out to sow.","And as he was sowing
 some seed fell along the path
 and the birds came and ate it up.","Other seed [of the same kind] fell on ground full of rocks
 where it had not much soil; and at once it sprang up
 because it had no depth of soil;","And when the sun came up
 it was scorched
 and because it had not taken root
 it withered away.","Other seed [of the same kind] fell among thorn plants
 and the thistles grew and pressed together and utterly choked and suffocated it
 and it yielded no grain.","And other seed [of the same kind] fell into good (well-adapted) soil and brought forth grain
 growing up and increasing
 and yielded up to thirty times as much
 and sixty times as much
 and even a hundred times as much as had been sown.","And He said
 He who has ears to hear
 let him be hearing [and let him consider
 and comprehend].","And He said to them
 To you has been entrusted the mystery of the kingdom of God [that is
 the secret counsels of God which are hidden from the ungodly]; but for those outside [of our circle] everything becomes a parable
","In order that they may [indeed] look and look but not see and perceive
 and may hear and hear but not grasp and comprehend
 lest haply they should turn again
 and it [their willful rejection of the truth] should be forgiven them.","And He said to them
 Do you not discern and understand this parable? How then is it possible for you to discern and understand all the parables?","The sower sows the Word.","The ones along the path are those who have the Word sown [in their hearts]
 but when they hear
 Satan comes at once and [by force] takes away the message which is sown in them.","And in the same way the ones sown upon stony ground are those who
 when they hear the Word
 at once receive and accept and welcome it with joy;","And they have no real root in themselves
 and so they endure for a little while; then when trouble or persecution arises on account of the Word
 they immediately are offended (become displeased
 indignant
 resentful) and they stumble and fall away.","And the ones sown among the thorns are others who hear the Word;","Then the cares and anxieties of the world and distractions of the age
 and the pleasure and delight and false glamour and deceitfulness of riches
 and the craving and passionate desire for other things creep in and choke and suffocate the Word
 and it becomes fruitless.","And those sown on the good (well-adapted) soil are the ones who hear the Word and receive and accept and welcome it and bear fruit\u2014some thirty times as much as was sown
 some sixty times as much
 and some [even] a hundred times as much.","And He said to them
 Is the lamp brought in to be put under a peck measure or under a bed
 and not [to be put] on the lampstand?","[Things are hidden temporarily only as a means to revelation.] For there is nothing hidden except to be revealed
 nor is anything [temporarily] kept secret except in order that it may be made known.","If any man has ears to hear
 let him be listening and let him perceive and comprehend.","And He said to them
 Be careful what you are hearing. The measure [of thought and study] you give [to the truth you hear] will be the measure [of virtue and knowledge] that comes back to you\u2014and more [besides] will be given to you who hear.","For to him who has will more be given; and from him who has nothing
 even what he has will be taken away [by force]
","And He said
 The kingdom of God is like a man who scatters seed upon the ground
","And then continues sleeping and rising night and day while the seed sprouts and grows and increases\u2014he knows not how.","The earth produces [acting] by itself\u2014first the blade
 then the ear
 then the full grain in the ear.","But when the grain is ripe and permits
 immediately he sends forth [the reapers] and puts in the sickle
 because the harvest stands ready.","And He said
 With what can we compare the kingdom of God
 or what parable shall we use to illustrate and explain it?","It is like a grain of mustard seed
 which
 when sown upon the ground
 is the smallest of all seeds upon the earth;","Yet after it is sown
 it grows up and becomes the greatest of all garden herbs and puts out large branches
 so that the birds of the air are able to make nests and dwell in its shade.","On that same day [when] evening had come
 He said to them
 Let us go over to the other side [of the lake].","And He arose and rebuked the wind and said to the sea
 Hush now! Be still (muzzled)! And the wind ceased (sank to rest as if exhausted by its beating) and there was [immediately] a great calm (a perfect peacefulness).","He said to them
 Why are you so timid and fearful? How is it that you have no faith (no firmly relying trust)?","For Jesus was commanding
 Come out of the man
 you unclean spirit!","And He asked him
 What is your name? He replied
 My name is Legion
 for we are many.","But Jesus refused to permit him
 but said to him
 Go home to your own [family and relatives and friends] and bring back word to them of how much the Lord has done for you
 and [how He has] had sympathy for you and mercy on you.","For she kept saying
 If I only touch His garments
 I shall be restored to health.","And the disciples kept saying to Him
 You see the crowd pressing hard around You from all sides
 and You ask
 Who touched Me?","And He said to her
 Daughter
 your faith (your trust and confidence in Me
 springing from faith in God) has restored you to health. Go in (into) peace and be continually healed and freed from your [distressing bodily] disease.","Overhearing but ignoring what they said
 Jesus said to the ruler of the synagogue
 Do not be seized with alarm and struck with fear; only keep on believing.","And when He had gone in
 He said to them
 Why do you make an uproar and weep? The little girl is not dead but is sleeping.","Gripping her [firmly] by the hand
 He said to her
 Talitha cumi\u2014which translated is
 Little girl
 I say to you
 arise [from the sleep of death]!","But Jesus said to them
 A prophet is not without honor (deference
 reverence) except in his [own] country and among [his] relatives and in his [own] house.","And He called to Him the Twelve [apostles] and began to send them out [as His ambassadors] two by two and gave them authority and power over the unclean spirits.","And He told them
 Wherever you go into a house
 stay there until you leave that place.","And if any community will not receive and accept and welcome you
 and they refuse to listen to you
 when you depart
 shake off the dust that is on your feet
 for a testimony against them. Truly I tell you
 it will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the judgment day than for that town.","But when Herod heard [of it]
 he said
 [This very] John
 whom I beheaded
 has been raised [from the dead].","For when the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced
 she pleased and fascinated Herod and his guests; and the king said to the girl
 Ask me for whatever you desire
 and I will give it to you.","Then she left the room and said to her mother
 What shall I ask for [myself]? And she replied
 The head of John the Baptist!","And He said to them
 [As for you] come away by yourselves to a deserted place
 and rest a while\u2014for many were [continually] coming and going
 and they had not even leisure enough to eat.","But He replied to them
 Give them something to eat yourselves. And they said to Him
 Shall we go and buy 200 denarii [about forty dollars] worth of bread and give it to them to eat?","And He said to them
 How many loaves do you have? Go and see. And when they [had looked and] knew
 they said
 Five [loaves] and two fish.","For they all saw Him and were agitated (troubled and filled with fear and dread). But immediately He talked with them and said
 Take heart! I Am! Stop being alarmed and afraid.","But He said to them
 Excellently and truly [so that there will be no room for blame] did Isaiah prophesy of you
 the pretenders and hypocrites
 as it stands written: These people [constantly] honor Me with their lips
 but their hearts hold off and are far distant from Me.","In vain (fruitlessly and without profit) do they worship Me
 ordering and teaching [to be obeyed] as doctrines the commandments and precepts of men.","You disregard and give up and ask to depart from you the commandment of God and cling to the tradition of men [keeping it carefully and faithfully].","And He said to them
 You have a fine way of rejecting [thus thwarting and nullifying and doing away with] the commandment of God in order to keep your tradition (your own human regulations)!","For Moses said
 Honor (revere with tenderness of feeling and deference) your father and your mother
 and
 He who curses or reviles or speaks evil of or abuses or treats improperly his father or mother
 let him surely die.","But [as for you] you say
 A man is exempt if he tells [his] father or [his] mother
 What you would otherwise have gained from me [everything I have that would have been of use to you] is Corban
 that is
 is a gift [already given as an offering to God]
","Then you no longer are permitting him to do anything for [his] father or mother [but are letting him off from helping them].","Thus you are nullifying and making void and of no effect [the authority of] the Word of God through your tradition
 which you [in turn] hand on. And many things of this kind you are doing.","And He called the people to [Him] again and said to them
 Listen to Me
 all of you
 and understand [what I say].","There is not [even] one thing outside a man which by going into him can pollute and defile him; but the things which come out of a man are what defile him and make him unhallowed and unclean.","And He said to them
 Then are you also unintelligent and dull and without understanding? Do you not discern and see that whatever goes into a man from the outside cannot make him unhallowed or unclean
","Since it does not reach and enter his heart but [only his] digestive tract
 and so passes on [into the place designed to receive waste]? Thus He was making and declaring all foods [ceremonially] clean [that is
 abolishing the ceremonial distinctions of the Levitical Law].","And He said
 What comes out of a man is what makes a man unclean and renders [him] unhallowed.","For from within
 [that is] out of the hearts of men
 come base and wicked thoughts
 sexual immorality
 stealing
 murder
 adultery
","Coveting (a greedy desire to have more wealth)
 dangerous and destructive wickedness
 deceit; unrestrained (indecent) conduct; an evil eye (envy)
 slander (evil speaking
 malicious misrepresentation
 abusiveness)
 pride (the sin of an uplifted heart against God and man)
 foolishness (folly
 lack of sense
 recklessness
 thoughtlessness).","All these evil [purposes and desires] come from within
 and they make the man unclean and render him unhallowed.","And He said to her
 First let the children be fed
 for it is not becoming or proper or right to take the children\u2019s bread and throw it to the [little house] dogs.","And He said to her
 Because of this saying
 you may go your way; the demon has gone out of your daughter [permanently].","And looking up to heaven
 He sighed as He said
 Ephphatha
 which means
 Be opened!","In those days when [again] an immense crowd had gathered and they had nothing to eat
 Jesus called His disciples to Him and told them
","I have pity and sympathy for the people and My heart goes out to them
 for they have been with Me now three days and have nothing [left] to eat;","And if I send them away to their homes hungry
 they will be feeble through exhaustion and faint along the road; and some of them have come a long way.","And He asked them
 How many loaves have you? They said
 Seven.","And He groaned and sighed deeply in His spirit and said
 Why does this generation demand a sign? Positively I say to you
 no sign shall be given this generation.","And Jesus [repeatedly and expressly] charged and admonished them
 saying
 Look out; keep on your guard and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod and the Herodians.","And being aware [of it]
 Jesus said to them
 Why are you reasoning and saying it is because you have no bread? Do you not yet discern or understand? Are your hearts in [a settled state of] hardness?","Having eyes
 do you not see [with them]
 and having ears
 do you not hear and perceive and understand the sense of what is said? And do you not remember?","When I broke the five loaves for the 5
000
 how many [small hand] baskets full of broken pieces did you take up? They said to Him
 Twelve.","And [when I broke] the seven loaves for the 4
000
 how many [large provision] baskets full of broken pieces did you take up? And they said to Him
 Seven.","And He kept repeating
 Do you not yet understand?","And He caught the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village; and when He had spit on his eyes and put His hands upon him
 He asked him
 Do you [possibly] see anything?","And He sent him away to his house
 telling [him]
 Do not [even] enter the village or tell anyone there.","And Jesus went on with His disciples to the villages of Caesarea Philippi; and on the way He asked His disciples
 Who do people say that I am?","And He asked them
 But who do you yourselves say that I am? Peter replied to Him
 You are the Christ (the Messiah
 the Anointed One).","But turning around [His back to Peter] and seeing His disciples
 He rebuked Peter
 saying
 Get behind Me
 Satan! For you do not have a mind intent on promoting what God wills
 but what pleases men [you are not on God\u2019s side
 but that of men].","And Jesus called [to Him] the throng with His disciples and said to them
 If anyone intends to come after Me
 let him deny himself [forget
 ignore
 disown
 and lose sight of himself and his own interests] and take up his cross
 and [joining Me as a disciple and siding with My party] follow with Me [continually
 cleaving steadfastly to Me].","For whoever wants to save his [higher
 spiritual
 eternal] life
 will lose it [the lower
 natural
 temporal life which is lived only on earth]; and whoever gives up his life [which is lived only on earth] for My sake and the Gospel\u2019s will save it [his higher
 spiritual life in the eternal kingdom of God].","For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world
 and forfeit his life [in the eternal kingdom of God]?","For what can a man give as an exchange (a compensation
 a ransom
 in return) for his [blessed] life [in the eternal kingdom of God]?","For whoever is ashamed [here and now] of Me and My words in this adulterous (unfaithful) and [preeminently] sinful generation
 of him will the Son of Man also be ashamed when He comes in the glory (splendor and majesty) of His Father with the holy angels.","And Jesus said to them
 Truly and solemnly I say to you
 there are some standing here who will in no way taste death before they see the kingdom of God come in [its] power.","And Peter took up the conversation
 saying
 Master
 it is good and suitable and beautiful for us to be here. Let us make three booths (tents)\u2014one for You and one for Moses and one for Elijah.","And He said to them
 Elijah
 it is true
 does come first to restore all things and set them to rights. And how is it written of the Son of Man that He will suffer many things and be utterly despised and be treated with contempt and rejected?","But I tell you that Elijah has already come
 and [people] did to him whatever they desired
 as it is written of him.","And He asked them
 About what are you questioning and discussing with them?","And He answered them
 O unbelieving generation [without any faith]! How long shall I [have to do] with you? How long am I to bear with you? Bring him to Me.","And [Jesus] asked his father
 How long has he had this? And he answered
 From the time he was a little boy.","And Jesus said
 [You say to Me]
 If You can do anything? [Why
] all things can be (are possible) to him who believes!","But when Jesus noticed that a crowd [of people] came running together
 He rebuked the unclean spirit
 saying to it
 You dumb and deaf spirit
 I charge you to come out of him and never go into him again.","And He replied to them
 This kind cannot be driven out by anything but prayer and fasting.","For He was [engaged for the time being in] teaching His disciples. He said to them
 The Son of Man is being delivered into the hands of men
 and they will put Him to death; and when He has been killed
 after three days He will rise [from death].","And they arrived at Capernaum; and when [they were] in the house
 He asked them
 What were you discussing and arguing about on the road?","And He sat down and called the Twelve [apostles]
 and He said to them
 If anyone desires to be first
 he must be last of all
 and servant of all.","And He took a little child and put him in the center of their group; and taking him in [His] arms
 He said to them
","But Jesus said
 Do not restrain or hinder or forbid him; for no one who does a mighty work in My name will soon afterward be able to speak evil of Me.","For he who is not against us is for us.","For I tell you truly
 whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you belong to and bear the name of Christ will by no means fail to get his reward.","And whoever causes one of these little ones (these believers) who acknowledge and cleave to Me to stumble and sin
 it would be better (more profitable and wholesome) for him if a [huge] millstone were hung about his neck
 and he were thrown into the sea.","And if your hand puts a stumbling block before you and causes you to sin
 cut it off! It is more profitable and wholesome for you to go into life [that is really worthwhile] maimed than with two hands to go to hell (Gehenna)
 into the fire that cannot be put out.","And if your foot is a cause of stumbling and sin to you
 cut it off! It is more profitable and wholesome for you to enter into life [that is really worthwhile] crippled than
 having two feet
 to be cast into hell (Gehenna).","And if your eye causes you to stumble and sin
 pluck it out! It is more profitable and wholesome for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into hell (Gehenna)
","Where their worm [which preys on the inhabitants and is a symbol of the wounds inflicted on the man himself by his sins] does not die
 and the fire is not put out.","For everyone shall be salted with fire.","Salt is good (beneficial)
 but if salt has lost its saltness
 how will you restore [the saltness to] it? Have salt within yourselves
 and be at peace and live in harmony with one another.","He answered them
 What did Moses command you?","But Jesus said to them
 Because of your hardness of heart [your condition of insensibility to the call of God] he wrote you this precept in your Law.","But from the beginning of creation God made them male and female.","For this reason a man shall leave [behind] his father and his mother and be joined to his wife and cleave closely to her permanently
","And the two shall become one flesh
 so that they are no longer two
 but one flesh.","What therefore God has united (joined together)
 let not man separate or divide.","And He said to them
 Whoever dismisses (repudiates and divorces) his wife and marries another commits adultery against her;","And if a woman dismisses (repudiates and divorces) her husband and marries another
 she commits adultery.","But when Jesus saw [it]
 He was indignant and pained and said to them
 Allow the children to come to Me\u2014do not forbid or prevent or hinder them\u2014for to such belongs the kingdom of God.","Truly I tell you
 whoever does not receive and accept and welcome the kingdom of God like a little child [does] positively shall not enter it at all.","And Jesus said to him
 Why do you call Me [essentially and perfectly morally] good? There is no one [essentially and perfectly morally] good\u2014except God alone.","You know the commandments: Do not kill
 do not commit adultery
 do not steal
 do not bear false witness
 do not defraud
 honor your father and mother.","And he replied to Him
 Teacher
 I have carefully guarded and observed all these and taken care not to violate them from my boyhood.","And Jesus
 looking upon him
 loved him
 and He said to him
 You lack one thing; go and sell all you have and give [the money] to the poor
 and you will have treasure in heaven; and come [and] accompany Me [walking the same road that I walk].","And Jesus looked around and said to His disciples
 With what difficulty will those who possess wealth and keep on holding it enter the kingdom of God!","And the disciples were amazed and bewildered and perplexed at His words. But Jesus said to them again
 Children
 how hard it is for those who trust (place their confidence
 their sense of safety) in riches to enter the kingdom of God!","It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.","And they were shocked and exceedingly astonished
 and said to Him and to one another
 Then who can be saved?","Jesus glanced around at them and said
 With men [it is] impossible
 but not with God; for all things are possible with God.","Jesus said
 Truly I tell you
 there is no one who has given up and left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or lands for My sake and for the Gospel\u2019s","Who will not receive a hundred times as much now in this time\u2014houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands
 with persecutions\u2014and in the age to come
 eternal life.","But many [who are now] first will be last [then]
 and many [who are now] last will be first [then].","[Saying]
 Behold
 we are going up to Jerusalem
 and the Son of Man will be turned over to the chief priests and the scribes; and they will condemn and sentence Him to death and turn Him over to the Gentiles.","And they will mock Him and spit on Him
 and whip Him and put Him to death; but after three days He will rise again [from death].","And James and John
 the sons of Zebedee
 approached Him and said to Him
 Teacher
 we desire You to do for us whatever we ask of You.","And He replied to them
 What do you desire Me to do for you?","But Jesus said to them
 You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink or be baptized with the baptism [of affliction] with which I am baptized?","And they replied to Him
 We are able. And Jesus told them
 The cup that I drink you will drink
 and you will be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized
","But to sit at My right hand or at My left hand is not Mine to give; but [it will be given to those] for whom it is ordained and prepared.","But Jesus called them to [Him] and said to them
 You know that those who are recognized as governing and are supposed to rule the Gentiles (the nations) lord it over them [ruling with absolute power
 holding them in subjection]
 and their great men exercise authority and dominion over them.","But this is not to be so among you; instead
 whoever desires to be great among you must be your servant
","And whoever wishes to be most important and first in rank among you must be slave of all.","For even the Son of Man came not to have service rendered to Him
 but to serve
 and to give His life as a ransom for (instead of) many.","And Jesus stopped and said
 Call him. And they called the blind man
 telling him
 Take courage! Get up! He is calling you.","And Jesus said to him
 What do you want Me to do for you? And the blind man said to Him
 Master
 let me receive my sight.","And Jesus said to him
 Go your way; your faith has healed you. And at once he received his sight and accompanied Jesus on the road.","And instructed them
 Go into the village in front of you
 and as soon as you enter it
 you will find a colt tied
 which has never been ridden by anyone; unfasten it and bring it [here].","If anyone asks you
 Why are you doing this? answer
 The Lord needs it
 and He will send it back here presently.","And He said to it
 No one ever again shall eat fruit from you. And His disciples were listening [to what He said].","And He taught and said to them
 Is it not written
 My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations? But you have turned it into a den of robbers.","And Jesus
 replying
 said to them
 Have faith in God [constantly].","Truly I tell you
 whoever says to this mountain
 Be lifted up and thrown into the sea! and does not doubt at all in his heart but believes that what he says will take place
 it will be done for him.","For this reason I am telling you
 whatever you ask for in prayer
 believe (trust and be confident) that it is granted to you
 and you will [get it].","And whenever you stand praying
 if you have anything against anyone
 forgive him and let it drop (leave it
 let it go)
 in order that your Father Who is in heaven may also forgive you your [own] failings and shortcomings and let them drop.","Jesus told them
 I will ask you a question. Answer Me
 and then I will tell you by what [sort of] authority I do these things.","Was the baptism of John from heaven or from men? Answer Me.","So they replied to Jesus
 We do not know. And Jesus said to them
 Neither am I going to tell you what [sort of] authority I have for doing these things.","And [Jesus] started to speak to them in parables [with comparisons and illustrations]. A man planted a vineyard and put a hedge around it and dug a pit for the winepress and built a tower and let it out [for rent] to vinedressers and went into another country.","When the season came
 he sent a bond servant to the tenants to collect from them some of the fruit of the vineyard.","But they took him and beat him and sent him away without anything.","Again he sent to them another bond servant
 and they stoned him and wounded him in the head and treated him shamefully [sending him away with insults].","And he sent another
 and that one they killed; then many others\u2014some they beat
 and some they put to death.","He had still one left [to send]
 a beloved son; last of all he sent him to them
 saying
 They will respect my son.","But those tenants said to one another
 Here is the heir; come on
 let us put him to death
 and [then] the inheritance will be ours.","And they took him and killed him
 and threw [his body] outside the vineyard.","Now what will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the tenants
 and give the vineyard to others.","Have you not even read this [passage of] Scripture: The very Stone which [after putting It to the test] the builders rejected has become the Head of the corner [Cornerstone];","This is from the Lord and is His doing
 and it is marvelous in our eyes?","But they sent some of the Pharisees and of the Herodians to Him for the purpose of entrapping Him in His speech.","Should we pay [them] or should we not pay [them]? But knowing their hypocrisy
 He asked them
 Why do you put Me to the test? Bring Me a coin (a denarius)
 so I may see it.","And they brought [Him one]. Then He asked them
 Whose image (picture) is this? And whose superscription (title)? They said to Him
 Caesar\u2019s.","Jesus said to them
 Pay to Caesar the things that are Caesar\u2019s and to God the things that are God\u2019s. And they stood marveling and greatly amazed at Him.","Jesus said to them
 Is not this where you wander out of the way and go wrong
 because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God?","For when they arise from among the dead
 [men] do not marry nor are [women] given in marriage
 but are like the angels in heaven.","But concerning the dead being raised\u2014have you not read in the book of Moses
 [in the passage] about the [burning] bush
 how God said to him
 I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob?","He is not the God of [the] dead
 but of [the] living! You are very wrong.","Then one of the scribes came up and listened to them disputing with one another
 and
 noticing that Jesus answered them fitly and admirably
 he asked Him
 Which commandment is first and most important of all [in its nature]?","Jesus answered
 The first and principal one of all commands is: Hear
 O Israel
 The Lord our God is one Lord;","And you shall love the Lord your God out of and with your whole heart and out of and with all your soul (your life) and out of and with all your mind (with your faculty of thought and your moral understanding) and out of and with all your strength. This is the first and principal commandment.","The second is like it and is this
 You shall love your neighbor as yourself. There is no other commandment greater than these.","And when Jesus saw that he answered intelligently (discreetly and having his wits about him)
 He said to him
 You are not far from the kingdom of God. And after that no one ventured or dared to ask Him any further question.","And as Jesus taught in [a porch or court of] the temple
 He said
 How can the scribes say that the Christ is David\u2019s Son?","David himself
 [inspired] in the Holy Spirit
 declared
 The Lord said to my Lord
 Sit at My right hand until I make Your enemies [a footstool] under Your feet.","David himself calls Him Lord; so how can it be that He is his Son? Now the great mass of the people heard [Jesus] gladly [listening to Him with delight].","And in [the course of] His teaching
 He said
 Beware of the scribes
 who like to go around in long robes and [to get] greetings in the marketplaces [public forums]
","And [have] the front seats in the synagogues and the chief couches (places of honor) at feasts
","Who devour widows\u2019 houses and to cover it up make long prayers. They will receive the heavier [sentence of] condemnation.","And He called His disciples [to Him] and said to them
 Truly and surely I tell you
 this widow
 [she who is] poverty-stricken
 has put in more than all those contributing to the treasury.","For they all threw in out of their abundance; but she
 out of her deep poverty
 has put in everything that she had\u2014[even] all she had on which to live.","And as [Jesus] was coming out of the temple [area]
 one of His disciples said to Him
 Look
 Teacher! Notice the sort and quality of these stones and buildings!","And Jesus replied to him
 You see these great buildings? There will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be loosened and torn down.","And Jesus began to tell them
 Be careful and watchful that no one misleads you [about it].","Many will come in [appropriating to themselves] the name [of Messiah] which belongs to Me [basing their claims on the use of My name]
 saying
 I am [He]! And they will mislead many.","And when you hear of wars and rumors of wars
 do not get alarmed (troubled and frightened); it is necessary [that these things] take place
 but the end is not yet.","For nation will rise against nation
 and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places; there will be famines and calamities. This is but the beginning of the intolerable anguish and suffering [only the first of the birth pangs].","But look to yourselves; for they will turn you over to councils
 and you will be beaten in the synagogues
 and you will stand before governors and kings for My sake as a testimony to them.","And the good news (the Gospel) must first be preached to all nations.","Now when they take you [to court] and put you under arrest
 do not be anxious beforehand about what you are to say nor [even] meditate about it; but say whatever is given you in that hour and at the moment
 for it is not you who will be speaking
 but the Holy Spirit.","And brother will hand over brother to death
 and the father his child; and children will take a stand against their parents and [have] them put to death.","And you will be hated and detested by everybody for My name\u2019s sake
 but he who patiently perseveres and endures to the end will be saved (made a partaker of the salvation by Christ
 and delivered from spiritual death).","But when you see the abomination of desolation mentioned by Daniel the prophet standing where it ought not to be\u2014[and] let the one who reads take notice and consider and understand and heed [this]\u2014then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.","Let him who is on the housetop not go down into the house nor go inside to take anything out of his house;","And let him who is in the field not turn back again to get his mantle (cloak).","And alas for those who are pregnant and for those who have nursing babies in those days!","Pray that it may not occur in winter
","For at that time there will be such affliction (oppression and tribulation) as has not been from the beginning of the creation which God created until this particular time\u2014and positively never will be [again].","And unless the Lord had shortened the days
 no human being would be saved (rescued); but for the sake of the elect
 His chosen ones (those whom He picked out for Himself)
 He has shortened the days.","And then if anyone says to you
 See
 here is the Christ (the Messiah)! or
 Look
 there He is! do not believe it.","False Christs (Messiahs) and false prophets will arise and show signs and [work] miracles to deceive and lead astray
 if possible
 even the elect (those God has chosen out for Himself).","But look to yourselves and be on your guard; I have told you everything beforehand.","But in those days
 after [the affliction and oppression and distress of] that tribulation
 the sun will be darkened
 and the moon will not give its light;","And the stars will be falling from the sky
 and the powers in the heavens will be shaken.","And then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great (kingly) power and glory (majesty and splendor).","And then He will send out the angels and will gather together His elect (those He has picked out for Himself) from the four winds
 from the farthest bounds of the earth to the farthest bounds of heaven.","Now learn a lesson from the fig tree: as soon as its branch becomes tender and it puts forth its leaves
 you recognize and know that summer is near.","So also
 when you see these things happening
 you may recognize and know that He is near
 at [the very] door.","Surely I say to you
 this generation (the whole multitude of people living at that one time) positively will not perish or pass away before all these things take place.","Heaven and earth will perish and pass away
 but My words will not perish or pass away.","But of that day or that hour not a [single] person knows
 not even the angels in heaven
 nor the Son
 but only the Father.","Be on your guard [constantly alert]
 and watch and pray; for you do not know when the time will come.","It is like a man [already] going on a journey; when he leaves home
 he puts his servants in charge
 each with his particular task
 and he gives orders to the doorkeeper to be constantly alert and on the watch.","Therefore watch (give strict attention
 be cautious and alert)
 for you do not know when the Master of the house is coming\u2014in the evening
 or at midnight
 or at cockcrowing
 or in the morning\u2014","[Watch
 I say] lest He come suddenly and unexpectedly and find you asleep.","And what I say to you I say to everybody: Watch (give strict attention
 be cautious
 active
 and alert)!","But there were some who were moved with indignation and said to themselves
 To what purpose was the ointment (perfume) thus wasted?","But Jesus said
 Let her alone; why are you troubling her? She has done a good and beautiful thing to Me [praiseworthy and noble].","For you always have the poor with you
 and whenever you wish you can do good to them; but you will not always have Me.","She has done what she could; she came beforehand to anoint My body for the burial.","And surely I tell you
 wherever the good news (the Gospel) is proclaimed in the entire world
 what she has done will be told in memory of her.","And He sent two of His disciples and said to them
 Go into the city
 and a man carrying an [earthen] jar or pitcher of water will meet you; follow him.","And whatever [house] he enters
 say to the master of the house
 The Teacher says: Where is My guest room
 where I may eat the Passover [supper] with My disciples?","And he will [himself] show you a large upper room
 furnished [with carpets and with dining couches properly spread] and ready; there prepare for us.","And while they were at the table eating
 Jesus said
 Surely I say to you
 one of you will betray Me
 [one] who is eating [here] with Me.","He replied to them
 It is one of the Twelve [apostles]
 one who is dipping [bread] into the [same deep] dish with Me.","For the Son of Man is going as it stands written concerning Him; but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been good (profitable and wholesome) for that man if he had never been born.","And while they were eating
 He took a loaf [of bread]
 praised God and gave thanks and asked Him to bless it to their use. [Then] He broke [it] and gave to them and said
 Take. Eat. This is My body.","And He said to them
 This is My blood [which ratifies] the new covenant
 [the blood] which is being poured out for (on account of) many.","Solemnly and surely I tell you
 I shall not again drink of the fruit of the vine till that day when I drink it of a new and a higher quality in God\u2019s kingdom.","And Jesus said to them
 You will all fall away this night [that is
 you will be caused to stumble and will begin to distrust and desert Me]
 for it stands written
 I will strike the Shepherd
 and the sheep will be scattered.","But after I am raised [to life]
 I will go before you into Galilee.","And Jesus said to him
 Truly I tell you
 this very night
 before a cock crows twice
 you will utterly deny Me [disclaiming all connection with Me] three times.","Then they went to a place called Gethsemane
 and He said to His disciples
 Sit down here while I pray.","And He said to them
 My soul is exceedingly sad (overwhelmed with grief) so that it almost kills Me! Remain here and keep awake and be watching.","And He was saying
 Abba
 [which means] Father
 everything is possible for You. Take away this cup from Me; yet not what I will
 but what You [will].","And He came back and found them sleeping
 and He said to Peter
 Simon
 are you asleep? Have you not the strength to keep awake and watch [with Me for] one hour?","Keep awake and watch and pray [constantly]
 that you may not enter into temptation; the spirit indeed is willing
 but the flesh is weak.","And He came back a third time and said to them
 Are you still sleeping and resting? It is enough [of that]! The hour has come. The Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinful men (men whose way or nature is to act in opposition to God).","Get up
 let us be going! See
 My betrayer is at hand!","And Jesus said to them
 Have you come out with swords and clubs as [you would] against a robber to capture Me?","I was with you daily in the temple [porches and courts] teaching
 and you did not seize Me; but [this has happened] that the Scriptures might be fulfilled.","And Jesus said
 I Am; and you will [all] see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power (the Almighty) and coming on the clouds of heaven.","And some of them began to spit on Him and to blindfold Him and to strike Him with their fists
 saying to Him
 Prophesy! And the guards received Him with blows and by slapping Him.","And at once for the second time a cock crowed. And Peter remembered how Jesus said to him
 Before a cock crows twice
 you will utterly deny Me [disclaiming all connection with Me] three times. And having put his thought upon it [and remembering]
 he broke down and wept aloud and lamented.","And Pilate inquired of Him
 Are You the King of the Jews? And He replied
 It is as you say.","And he replied to them
 Do you wish me to set free for you the King of the Jews?","And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice
 Eloi
 Eloi
 lama sabachthani?\u2014which means
 My God
 My God
 why have You forsaken Me [deserting Me and leaving Me helpless and abandoned]?","And when the centurion who stood facing Him saw Him expire this way
 he said
 Really
 this Man was God\u2019s Son!","But Pilate wondered whether He was dead so soon
 and
 having called the centurion
 he asked him whether [Jesus] was already dead.","And they said to one another
 Who will roll back the stone for us out of [the groove across the floor at] the door of the tomb?","And he said to them
 Do not be amazed and terrified; you are looking for Jesus of Nazareth
 Who was crucified. He has risen; He is not here. See the place where they laid Him.","And He said to them
 Go into all the world and preach and publish openly the good news (the Gospel) to every creature [of the whole human race].","He who believes [who adheres to and trusts in and relies on the Gospel and Him Whom it sets forth] and is baptized will be saved [from the penalty of eternal death]; but he who does not believe [who does not adhere to and trust in and rely on the Gospel and Him Whom it sets forth] will be condemned.","And these attesting signs will accompany those who believe: in My name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new languages;","They will pick up serpents; and [even] if they drink anything deadly
 it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick
 and they will get well.","The beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ
 God\u2019s Son
","saying
 \u201cNow is the time! Here comes God\u2019s kingdom! Change your hearts and lives
 and trust this good news!\u201d","\u201cCome
 follow me
\u201d he said
 \u201cand I\u2019ll show you how to fish for people.\u201d","\u201cSilence!\u201d Jesus said
 speaking harshly to the demon. \u201cCome out of him!\u201d","When they found him
 they told him
 \u201cEveryone\u2019s looking for you!\u201d","He replied
 \u201cLet\u2019s head in the other direction
 to the nearby villages
 so that I can preach there too. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve come.\u201d","Incensed
 Jesus reached out his hand
 touched him
 and said
 \u201cI do want to. Be clean.\u201d","saying
 \u201cDon\u2019t say anything to anyone. Instead
 go and show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifice for your cleansing that Moses commanded. This will be a testimony to them.\u201d","When Jesus saw their faith
 he said to the paralytic
 \u201cChild
 your sins are forgiven!\u201d","Jesus immediately recognized what they were discussing
 and he said to them
 \u201cWhy do you fill your minds with these questions?","Which is easier\u2014to say to a paralyzed person
 \u2018Your sins are forgiven
\u2019 or to say
 \u2018Get up
 take up your bed
 and walk\u2019?","But so you will know that the Human One has authority on the earth to forgive sins\u201d\u2014he said to the man who was paralyzed
","\u201cGet up
 take your mat
 and go home.\u201d","As he continued along
 he saw Levi
 Alphaeus\u2019 son
 sitting at a kiosk for collecting taxes. Jesus said to him
 \u201cFollow me.\u201d Levi got up and followed him.","When Jesus heard it
 he said to them
 \u201cHealthy people don\u2019t need a doctor
 but sick people do. I didn\u2019t come to call righteous people
 but sinners.\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cThe wedding guests can\u2019t fast while the groom is with them
 can they? As long as they have the groom with them
 they can\u2019t fast.","But the days will come when the groom will be taken away from them
 and then they will fast.","\u201cNo one sews a piece of new
 unshrunk cloth on old clothes; otherwise
 the patch tears away from it
 the new from the old
 and makes a worse tear.","No one pours new wine into old leather wineskins; otherwise
 the wine would burst the wineskins and the wine would be lost and the wineskins destroyed. But new wine is for new wineskins.\u201d","The Pharisees said to Jesus
 \u201cLook! Why are they breaking the Sabbath law?\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cHaven\u2019t you ever read what David did when he was in need
 when he and those with him were hungry?","Then he said
 \u201cThe Sabbath was created for humans; humans weren\u2019t created for the Sabbath.","This is why the Human One is Lord even over the Sabbath.\u201d","He said to the man with the withered hand
 \u201cStep up where people can see you.\u201d","Then he said to them
 \u201cIs it legal on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil
 to save life or to kill?\u201d But they said nothing.","Looking around at them with anger
 deeply grieved at their unyielding hearts
 he said to the man
 \u201cStretch out your hand.\u201d So he did
 and his hand was made healthy.","When Jesus called them together he spoke to them in a parable: \u201cHow can Satan throw Satan out?","A kingdom involved in civil war will collapse.","And a house torn apart by divisions will collapse.","If Satan rebels against himself and is divided
 then he can\u2019t endure. He\u2019s done for.","No one gets into the house of a strong person and steals anything without first tying up the strong person. Only then can the house be burglarized.","I assure you that human beings will be forgiven for everything
 for all sins and insults of every kind.","But whoever insults the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven. That person is guilty of a sin with consequences that last forever.\u201d","A crowd was seated around him
 and those sent to him said
 \u201cLook
 your mother
 brothers
 and sisters are outside looking for you.\u201d","He replied
 \u201cWho is my mother? Who are my brothers?\u201d","Looking around at those seated around him in a circle
 he said
 \u201cLook
 here are my mother and my brothers.","Whoever does God\u2019s will is my brother
 sister
 and mother.\u201d","He said many things to them in parables. While teaching them
 he said
","\u201cListen to this! A farmer went out to scatter seed.","As he was scattering seed
 some fell on the path; and the birds came and ate it.","Other seed fell on rocky ground where the soil was shallow. They sprouted immediately because the soil wasn\u2019t deep.","When the sun came up
 it scorched the plants; and they dried up because they had no roots.","Other seed fell among thorny plants. The thorny plants grew and choked the seeds
 and they produced nothing.","Other seed fell into good soil and bore fruit. Upon growing and increasing
 the seed produced in one case a yield of thirty to one
 in another case a yield of sixty to one
 and in another case a yield of one hundred to one.\u201d","He said
 \u201cWhoever has ears to listen should pay attention!\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cThe secret of God\u2019s kingdom has been given to you
 but to those who are outside everything comes in parables.","This is so that they can look and see but have no insight
 and they can hear but not understand. Otherwise
 they might turn their lives around and be forgiven.","\u201cDon\u2019t you understand this parable? Then how will you understand all the parables?","The farmer scatters the word.","This is the meaning of the seed that fell on the path: When the word is scattered and people hear it
 right away Satan comes and steals the word that was planted in them.","Here\u2019s the meaning of the seed that fell on rocky ground: When people hear the word
 they immediately receive it joyfully.","Because they have no roots
 they last for only a little while. When they experience distress or abuse because of the word
 they immediately fall away.","Others are like the seed scattered among the thorny plants. These are the ones who have heard the word;","but the worries of this life
 the false appeal of wealth
 and the desire for more things break in and choke the word
 and it bears no fruit.","The seed scattered on good soil are those who hear the word and embrace it. They bear fruit
 in one case a yield of thirty to one
 in another case sixty to one
 and in another case one hundred to one.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cDoes anyone bring in a lamp in order to put it under a basket or a bed? Shouldn\u2019t it be placed on a lampstand?","Everything hidden will be revealed
 and everything secret will come out into the open.","Whoever has ears to listen should pay attention!\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cListen carefully! God will evaluate you with the same standard you use to evaluate others. Indeed
 you will receive even more.","Those who have will receive more
 but as for those who don\u2019t have
 even what they don\u2019t have will be taken away from them.\u201d","Then Jesus said
 \u201cThis is what God\u2019s kingdom is like. It\u2019s as though someone scatters seed on the ground
","then sleeps and wakes night and day. The seed sprouts and grows
 but the farmer doesn\u2019t know how.","The earth produces crops all by itself
 first the stalk
 then the head
 then the full head of grain.","Whenever the crop is ready
 the farmer goes out to cut the grain because it\u2019s harvesttime.\u201d","He continued
 \u201cWhat\u2019s a good image for God\u2019s kingdom? What parable can I use to explain it?","Consider a mustard seed. When scattered on the ground
 it\u2019s the smallest of all the seeds on the earth;","but when it\u2019s planted
 it grows and becomes the largest of all vegetable plants. It produces such large branches that the birds in the sky are able to nest in its shade.\u201d","Later that day
 when evening came
 Jesus said to them
 \u201cLet\u2019s cross over to the other side of the lake.\u201d","He got up and gave orders to the wind
 and he said to the lake
 \u201cSilence! Be still!\u201d The wind settled down and there was a great calm.","Jesus asked them
 \u201cWhy are you frightened? Don\u2019t you have faith yet?\u201d","He said this because Jesus had already commanded him
 \u201cUnclean spirit
 come out of the man!\u201d","Jesus asked him
 \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d He responded
 \u201cLegion is my name
 because we are many.\u201d","But Jesus wouldn\u2019t allow it. \u201cGo home to your own people
\u201d Jesus said
 \u201cand tell them what the Lord has done for you and how he has shown you mercy.\u201d","She was thinking
 If I can just touch his clothes
 I\u2019ll be healed.","His disciples said to him
 \u201cDon\u2019t you see the crowd pressing against you? Yet you ask
 \u2018Who touched me?\u2019\u201d","He responded
 \u201cDaughter
 your faith has healed you; go in peace
 healed from your disease.\u201d","But Jesus overheard their report and said to the synagogue leader
 \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid; just keep trusting.\u201d","He went in and said to them
 \u201cWhat\u2019s all this commotion and crying about? The child isn\u2019t dead. She\u2019s only sleeping.\u201d","Taking her hand
 he said to her
 \u201cTalitha koum
\u201d which means
 \u201cYoung woman
 get up.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cProphets are honored everywhere except in their own hometowns
 among their relatives
 and in their own households.\u201d","He called for the Twelve and sent them out in pairs. He gave them authority over unclean spirits.","He said
 \u201cWhatever house you enter
 remain there until you leave that place.","If a place doesn\u2019t welcome you or listen to you
 as you leave
 shake the dust off your feet as a witness against them.\u201d","But when Herod heard these rumors
 he said
 \u201cJohn
 whom I beheaded
 has been raised to life.\u201d","Herod\u2019s daughter Herodias came in and danced
 thrilling Herod and his dinner guests. The king said to the young woman
 \u201cAsk me whatever you wish
 and I will give it to you.\u201d","She left the banquet hall and said to her mother
 \u201cWhat should I ask for?\u201d \u201cJohn the Baptist\u2019s head
\u201d Herodias replied.","Many people were coming and going
 so there was no time to eat. He said to the apostles
 \u201cCome by yourselves to a secluded place and rest for a while.\u201d","He replied
 \u201cYou give them something to eat.\u201d But they said to him
 \u201cShould we go off and buy bread worth almost eight months\u2019 pay and give it to them to eat?\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cHow much bread do you have? Take a look.\u201d After checking
 they said
 \u201cFive loaves of bread and two fish.\u201d","Seeing him was terrifying to all of them. Just then he spoke to them
 \u201cBe encouraged! It\u2019s me. Don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d","He replied
 \u201cIsaiah really knew what he was talking about when he prophesied about you hypocrites. He wrote
 This people honors me with their lips
 but their hearts are far away from me.","Their worship of me is empty since they teach instructions that are human words.","You ignore God\u2019s commandment while holding on to rules created by humans and handed down to you.\u201d","Jesus continued
 \u201cClearly
 you are experts at rejecting God\u2019s commandment in order to establish these rules.","Moses said
 Honor your father and your mother
 and The person who speaks against father or mother will certainly be put to death.","But you say
 \u2018If you tell your father or mother
 \u201cEverything I\u2019m expected to contribute to you is corban(that is
 a gift I\u2019m giving to God)
\u201d","then you are no longer required to care for your father or mother.\u2019","In this way you do away with God\u2019s word in favor of the rules handed down to you
 which you pass on to others. And you do a lot of other things just like that.\u201d","Then Jesus called the crowd again and said
 \u201cListen to me
 all of you
 and understand.","Nothing outside of a person can enter and contaminate a person in God\u2019s sight; rather
 the things that come out of a person contaminate the person.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cDon\u2019t you understand either? Don\u2019t you know that nothing from the outside that enters a person has the power to contaminate?","That\u2019s because it doesn\u2019t enter into the heart but into the stomach
 and it goes out into the sewer.\u201d By saying this
 Jesus declared that no food could contaminate a person in God\u2019s sight.","\u201cIt\u2019s what comes out of a person that contaminates someone in God\u2019s sight
\u201d he said.","\u201cIt\u2019s from the inside
 from the human heart
 that evil thoughts come: sexual sins
 thefts
 murders
","adultery
 greed
 evil actions
 deceit
 unrestrained immorality
 envy
 insults
 arrogance
 and foolishness.","All these evil things come from the inside and contaminate a person in God\u2019s sight.\u201d","He responded
 \u201cThe children have to be fed first. It isn\u2019t right to take the children\u2019s bread and toss it to the dogs.\u201d","\u201cGood answer!\u201d he said. \u201cGo on home. The demon has already left your daughter.\u201d","Looking into heaven
 Jesus sighed deeply and said
 \u201cEphphatha
\u201d which means
 \u201cOpen up.\u201d","In those days there was another large crowd with nothing to eat. Jesus called his disciples and told them
","\u201cI feel sorry for the crowd because they have been with me for three days and have nothing to eat.","If I send them away hungry to their homes
 they won\u2019t have enough strength to travel
 for some have come a long distance.\u201d","Jesus asked
 \u201cHow much bread do you have?\u201d They said
 \u201cSeven loaves.\u201d","With an impatient sigh
 Jesus said
 \u201cWhy does this generation look for a sign? I assure you that no sign will be given to it.\u201d","He gave them strict orders: \u201cWatch out and be on your guard for the yeast of the Pharisees as well as the yeast of Herod.\u201d","Jesus knew what they were discussing and said
 \u201cWhy are you talking about the fact that you don\u2019t have any bread? Don\u2019t you grasp what has happened? Don\u2019t you understand? Are your hearts so resistant to what God is doing?","Don\u2019t you have eyes? Why can\u2019t you see? Don\u2019t you have ears? Why can\u2019t you hear?

 \u201cSeven.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cAnd you still don\u2019t understand?\u201d","Taking the blind man\u2019s hand
 Jesus led him out of the village. After spitting on his eyes and laying his hands on the man
 he asked him
 \u201cDo you see anything?\u201d","Then Jesus sent him home
 saying
 \u201cDon\u2019t go into the village!\u201d","Jesus and his disciples went into the villages near Caesarea Philippi. On the way he asked his disciples
 \u201cWho do people say that I am?\u201d","He asked them
 \u201cAnd what about you? Who do you say that I am?\u201d Peter answered
 \u201cYou are the Christ.\u201d","Jesus turned and looked at his disciples
 then sternly corrected Peter: \u201cGet behind me
 Satan. You are not thinking God\u2019s thoughts but human thoughts.\u201d","After calling the crowd together with his disciples
 Jesus said to them
 \u201cAll who want to come after me must say no to themselves

 and follow me.","All who want to save their lives will lose them. But all who lose their lives because of me and because of the good news will save them.","Why would people gain the whole world but lose their lives?","What will people give in exchange for their lives?","Whoever is ashamed of me and my words in this unfaithful and sinful generation
 the Human One will be ashamed of that person when he comes in the Father\u2019s glory with the holy angels.\u201d","Jesus continued
 \u201cI assure you that some standing here won\u2019t die before they see God\u2019s kingdom arrive in power.\u201d","Peter reacted to all of this by saying to Jesus
 \u201cRabbi
 it\u2019s good that we\u2019re here. Let\u2019s make three shrines\u2014one for you
 one for Moses
 and one for Elijah.\u201d","He answered
 \u201cElijah does come first to restore all things. Why was it written that the Human One would suffer many things and be rejected?","In fact
 I tell you that Elijah has come
 but they did to him whatever they wanted

 \u201cWhat are you arguing about?\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cYou faithless generation
 how long will I be with you? How long will I put up with you? Bring him to me.\u201d","Jesus asked his father
 \u201cHow long has this been going on?\u201d He said
 \u201cSince he was a child.","Jesus said to him
 \u201c\u2018If you can do anything\u2019? All things are possible for the one who has faith.\u201d","Noticing that the crowd had surged together
 Jesus spoke harshly to the unclean spirit
 \u201cMute and deaf spirit
 I command you to come out of him and never enter him again.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cThrowing this kind of spirit out requires prayer.\u201d","This was because he was teaching his disciples
 \u201cThe Human One will be delivered into human hands. They will kill him. Three days after he is killed he will rise up.\u201d","They entered Capernaum. When they had come into a house
 he asked them
 \u201cWhat were you arguing about during the journey?\u201d","He sat down
 called the Twelve
 and said to them
 \u201cWhoever wants to be first must be least of all and the servant of all.\u201d","Jesus reached for a little child
 placed him among the Twelve

","Jesus replied
 \u201cDon\u2019t stop him. No one who does powerful acts in my name can quickly turn around and curse me.","Whoever isn\u2019t against us is for us.","I assure you that whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you belong to Christ will certainly be rewarded.","\u201cAs for whoever causes these little ones who believe in me to trip and fall into sin
 it would be better for them to have a huge stone hung around their necks and to be thrown into the lake.","If your hand causes you to fall into sin
 chop it off. It\u2019s better for you to enter into life crippled than to go away with two hands into the fire of hell
 which can\u2019t be put out.","If your foot causes you to fall into sin
 chop it off. It\u2019s better for you to enter life lame than to be thrown into hell with two feet.","If your eye causes you to fall into sin
 tear it out. It\u2019s better for you to enter God\u2019s kingdom with one eye than to be thrown into hell with two.","That\u2019s a place where worms don\u2019t die and the fire never goes out.","Everyone will be salted with fire.","Salt is good; but if salt loses its saltiness
 how will it become salty again? Maintain salt among yourselves and keep peace with each other.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cWhat did Moses command you?\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cHe wrote this commandment for you because of your unyielding hearts.","At the beginning of creation
 God made them male and female.","Because of this
 a man should leave his father and mother and be joined together with his wife

 humans must not pull apart what God has put together.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cWhoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her;","and if a wife divorces her husband and marries another
 she commits adultery.\u201d","When Jesus saw this
 he grew angry and said to them
 \u201cAllow the children to come to me. Don\u2019t forbid them
 because God\u2019s kingdom belongs to people like these children.","I assure you that whoever doesn\u2019t welcome God\u2019s kingdom like a child will never enter it.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cWhy do you call me good? No one is good except the one God.","You know the commandments: Don\u2019t commit murder. Don\u2019t commit adultery. Don\u2019t steal. Don\u2019t give false testimony. Don\u2019t cheat. Honor your father and mother.\u201d","\u201cTeacher
\u201d he responded

 Jesus said to his disciples
 \u201cIt will be very hard for the wealthy to enter God\u2019s kingdom!\u201d","His words startled the disciples

 \u201cIt\u2019s impossible with human beings

 \u2018Why are you doing this?\u2019 say
 \u2018Its master needs it

 \u201cWe don\u2019t know.\u201d Jesus replied
 \u201cNeither will I tell you what kind of authority I have to do these things.\u201d","Jesus spoke to them in parables. \u201cA man planted a vineyard

 he sent a servant to collect from the tenants his share of the fruit of the vineyard.","But they grabbed the servant
 beat him
 and sent him away empty-handed.","Again the landowner sent another servant to them

 They will respect my son.","But those tenant farmers said to each other
 \u2018This is the heir. Let\u2019s kill him

 I am the God of Abraham
 the God of Isaac
 and the God of Jacob?","He isn\u2019t the God of the dead but of the living. You are seriously mistaken.\u201d","One of the legal experts heard their dispute and saw how well Jesus answered them. He came over and asked him
 \u201cWhich commandment is the most important of all?\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cThe most important one is Israel

","and you must love the Lord your God with all your heart
 with all your being
 with all your mind
 and with all your strength.","The second is this
 You will love your neighbor as yourself. No other commandment is greater than these.\u201d","When Jesus saw that he had answered with wisdom
 he said to him
 \u201cYou aren\u2019t far from God\u2019s kingdom.\u201d After that
 no one dared to ask him any more questions.","While Jesus was teaching in the temple
 he said
 \u201cWhy do the legal experts say that the Christ is David\u2019s son?","David himself
 inspired by the Holy Spirit
 said
 The Lord said to my lord
 \u2018Sit at my right side until I turn your enemies into your footstool.\u2019","David himself calls him \u2018Lord
\u2019 so how can he be David\u2019s son?\u201d The large crowd listened to him with delight.","As he was teaching
 he said
 \u201cWatch out for the legal experts. They like to walk around in long robes. They want to be greeted with honor in the markets.","They long for places of honor in the synagogues and at banquets.","They are the ones who cheat widows out of their homes
 and to show off they say long prayers. They will be judged most harshly.\u201d","Jesus called his disciples to him and said
 \u201cI assure you that this poor widow has put in more than everyone who\u2019s been putting money in the treasury.","All of them are giving out of their spare change. But she from her hopeless poverty has given everything she had
 even what she needed to live on.\u201d","As Jesus left the temple
 one of his disciples said to him
 \u201cTeacher
 look! What awesome stones and buildings!\u201d","Jesus responded
 \u201cDo you see these enormous buildings? Not even one stone will be left upon another. All will be demolished.\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cWatch out that no one deceives you.","Many people will come in my name
 saying
 \u2018I\u2019m the one!\u2019 They will deceive many people.","When you hear of wars and reports of wars
 don\u2019t be alarmed. These things must happen
 but this isn\u2019t the end yet.","Nations and kingdoms will fight against each other
 and there will be earthquakes and famines in all sorts of places. These things are just the beginning of the sufferings associated with the end.","\u201cWatch out for yourselves. People will hand you over to the councils. You will be beaten in the synagogues. You will stand before governors and kings because of me so that you can testify before them.","First
 the good news must be proclaimed to all the nations.","When they haul you in and hand you over
 don\u2019t worry ahead of time about what to answer or say. Instead
 say whatever is given to you at that moment
 for you aren\u2019t doing the speaking but the Holy Spirit is.","Brothers and sisters will hand each other over to death. A father will turn in his children. Children will rise up against their parents and have them executed.","Everyone will hate you because of my name. But whoever stands firm until the end will be saved.","\u201cWhen you see the disgusting and destructive thing standing where it shouldn\u2019t be (the reader should understand this)
 then those in Judea must escape to the mountains.","Those on the roof shouldn\u2019t come down or enter their houses to grab anything.","Those in the field shouldn\u2019t come back to grab their clothes.","How terrible it will be at that time for women who are pregnant and for women who are nursing their children.","Pray that it doesn\u2019t happen in winter.","In those days there will be great suffering such as the world has never before seen and will never again see.","If the Lord hadn\u2019t shortened that time
 no one would be rescued. But for the sake of the chosen ones
 the ones whom God chose
 he has cut short the time.","\u201cThen if someone says to you
 \u2018Look
 here\u2019s the Christ
\u2019 or \u2018There he is
\u2019 don\u2019t believe it.","False christs and false prophets will appear
 and they will offer signs and wonders in order to deceive
 if possible
 those whom God has chosen.","But you
 watch out! I\u2019ve told you everything ahead of time.","\u201cIn those days
 after the suffering of that time
 the sun will become dark
 and the moon won\u2019t give its light.","The stars will fall from the sky
 and the planets and other heavenly bodies will be shaken.","Then they will see the Human One coming in the clouds with great power and splendor.","Then he will send the angels and gather together his chosen people from the four corners of the earth
 from the end of the earth to the end of heaven.","\u201cLearn this parable from the fig tree. After its branch becomes tender and it sprouts new leaves
 you know that summer is near.","In the same way
 when you see these things happening
 you know that he\u2019s near
 at the door.","I assure you that this generation won\u2019t pass away until all these things happen.","Heaven and earth will pass away
 but my words will certainly not pass away.","\u201cBut nobody knows when that day or hour will come
 not the angels in heaven and not the Son. Only the Father knows.","Watch out! Stay alert! You don\u2019t know when the time is coming.","It is as if someone took a trip
 left the household behind
 and put the servants in charge
 giving each one a job to do
 and told the doorkeeper to stay alert.","Therefore
 stay alert! You don\u2019t know when the head of the household will come
whether in the evening or at midnight
 or when the rooster crows in the early morning or at daybreak.","Don\u2019t let him show up when you weren\u2019t expecting and find you sleeping.","What I say to you
 I say to all: Stay alert!\u201d","Some grew angry. They said to each other
 \u201cWhy waste the perfume?","Jesus said
 \u201cLeave her alone. Why do you make trouble for her? She has done a good thing for me.","You always have the poor with you; and whenever you want
 you can do something good for them. But you won\u2019t always have me.","She has done what she could. She has anointed my body ahead of time for burial.","I tell you the truth that
 wherever in the whole world the good news is announced
 what she\u2019s done will also be told in memory of her.\u201d","He sent two of his disciples and said to them
 \u201cGo into the city. A man carrying a water jar will meet you. Follow him.","Wherever he enters

 \u2018The teacher asks
 \u201cWhere is my guest room where I can eat the Passover meal with my disciples?\u201d\u2019","He will show you a large room upstairs already furnished. Prepare for us there.\u201d","During the meal
 Jesus said
 \u201cI assure you that one of you will betray me\u2014someone eating with me.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cIt\u2019s one of the Twelve
 one who is dipping bread with me into this bowl.","The Human One goes to his death just as it is written about him. But how terrible it is for that person who betrays the Human One! It would have been better for him if he had never been born.\u201d","While they were eating
 Jesus took bread
 blessed it
 broke it
 and gave it to them
 and said
 \u201cTake; this is my body.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cThis is my blood of the covenant
 which is poured out for many.","I assure you that I won\u2019t drink wine again until that day when I drink it in a new way in God\u2019s kingdom.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cYou will all falter in your faithfulness to me. It is written
 I will hit the shepherd
 and the sheep will go off in all directions.","But after I\u2019m raised up
 I will go before you to Galilee.\u201d","But Jesus said to him
 \u201cI assure you that on this very night

 here comes my betrayer.\u201d","Jesus responded
 \u201cHave you come with swords and clubs to arrest me

 \u201cI am. And you will see the Human One sitting on the right side of the Almighty and coming on the heavenly clouds.\u201d","Some began to spit on him. Some covered his face and hit him

 \u201cProphesy!\u201d Then the guards took him and beat him.","At that very moment
 a rooster crowed a second time. Peter remembered what Jesus told him
 \u201cBefore a rooster crows twice

 sobbing.","Pilate questioned him

 \u201cI want to! Now you are well.\u201d ","He said
 \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone about this. Just go and show the priest that you are well. Then take a gift to the temple as Moses commanded

 he said to the crippled man
 \u201cMy friend
 your sins are forgiven.\u201d","Right away

 \u201cWhy are you thinking such things? ","Is it easier for me to tell this crippled man that his sins are forgiven or to tell him to get up and pick up his mat and go on home?","I will show you that the Son of Man has the right to forgive sins here on earth.\u201d So Jesus said to the man
 ","\u201cGet up! Pick up your mat and go on home.\u201d","As he walked along

 \u201cWhy are your disciples picking grain on the Sabbath? They are not supposed to do that!\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cHaven\u2019t you read what David did when he and his followers were hungry and in need? ","Jesus finished by saying
 \u201cPeople were not made for the good of the Sabbath. The Sabbath was made for the good of people. ","So the Son of Man is Lord over the Sabbath.\u201d","Jesus told the man to stand up where everyone could see him.","Then he asked
 \u201cOn the Sabbath should we do good deeds or evil deeds? Should we save someone\u2019s life or destroy it?\u201d But no one said a word.","Jesus was angry as he looked around at the people. Yet he felt sorry for them because they were so stubborn. Then he told the man
 \u201cStretch out your hand.\u201d He did
 and his bad hand was healed.","Jesus told the people to gather around him.

 \u201cYour mother and your brothers and sisters are outside and want to see you.\u201d","Jesus asked
 \u201cWho is my mother and who are my brothers?\u201d ","Then he looked at the people sitting around him and said
 \u201cHere are my mother and my brothers. ","Anyone who obeys God is my brother or sister or mother.\u201d","He used stories to teach them many things

 some of it fell along the road and was eaten by birds. ","Other seeds fell on thin
 rocky ground and quickly started growing because the soil wasn\u2019t very deep. ","But when the sun came up
 the plants were scorched and dried up
 because they did not have enough roots. ","Some other seeds fell where thornbushes grew up and choked out the plants. So they did not produce any grain.","But a few seeds did fall on good ground where the plants grew and produced thirty or sixty or even a hundred times as much as was scattered.","Then Jesus said
 \u201cIf you have ears
 pay attention.\u201d","He answered: I have explained the secret about God\u2019s kingdom to you
 but for others I can use only stories. ","The reason is
 \u201cThese people will look and look
 but never see. They will listen and listen
 but never understand. If they did
 they would turn to God
 and he would forgive them.\u201d","Jesus told them: If you don\u2019t understand this story
 you won\u2019t understand any others. ","What the farmer is spreading is really the message about the kingdom.","The seeds that fell along the road are the people who hear the message. But Satan soon comes and snatches it away from them.","The seeds that fell on rocky ground are the people who gladly hear the message and accept it right away.","But they don\u2019t have any roots
 and they don\u2019t last very long. As soon as life gets hard or the message gets them in trouble
 they give up.","The seeds that fell among the thornbushes are also people who hear the message.","But they start worrying about the needs of this life. They are fooled by the desire to get rich and to have all kinds of other things. So the message gets choked out
 and they never produce anything. ","The seeds that fell on good ground are the people who hear and welcome the message. They produce thirty or sixty or even a hundred times as much as was planted.","Jesus also said: You don\u2019t light a lamp and put it under a clay pot or under a bed. Don\u2019t you put a lamp on a lampstand?","There is nothing hidden that will not be made public. There is no secret that will not be well known.","If you have ears
 pay attention!","Listen carefully to what you hear! The way you treat others will be the way you will be treated\u2014and even worse.","Everyone who has something will be given more. But people who don\u2019t have anything will lose what little they have.","Again Jesus said: God\u2019s kingdom is like what happens when a farmer scatters seed in a field.","The farmer sleeps at night and is up and around during the day. Yet the seeds keep sprouting and growing
 and he doesn\u2019t understand how. ","It is the ground that makes the seeds sprout and grow into plants that produce grain.","Then when harvest season comes and the grain is ripe
 the farmer cuts it with a sickle.","Finally
 Jesus said: What is God\u2019s kingdom like? What story can I use to explain it? ","It is like what happens when a mustard seed is planted in the ground. It is the smallest seed in all the world.","But once it is planted
 it grows larger than any garden plant. It even puts out branches that are big enough for birds to nest in its shade.","That evening
 Jesus said to his disciples
 \u201cLet\u2019s cross to the east side.\u201d ","Jesus got up and ordered the wind and the waves to be quiet. The wind stopped
 and everything was calm.","Jesus asked his disciples
 \u201cWhy were you afraid? Don\u2019t you have any faith?\u201d","The man said this because Jesus had already told the evil spirit to come out of him.","Jesus asked
 \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d The man answered
 \u201cMy name is Lots
 because I have \u2018lots' of evil spirits.\u201d ","But Jesus would not let him. Instead
 he said
 \u201cGo home to your family and tell them how much the Lord has done for you and how good he has been to you.\u201d","She had said to herself
 \u201cIf I can just touch his clothes
 I will get well.\u201d ","His disciples said to him
 \u201cLook at all these people crowding around you! How can you ask who touched you?\u201d ","Jesus said to the woman
 \u201cYou are now well because of your faith. May God give you peace! You are healed
 and you will no longer be in pain.\u201d","Jesus heard what they said
 and he said to Jairus
 \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Just have faith!\u201d","Then Jesus went inside and said to them
 \u201cWhy are you crying and carrying on like this? The child isn\u2019t dead. She is just asleep.\u201d ","He took the twelve-year-old girl by the hand and said
 \u201cTalitha
 koum!\u201d which means
 \u201cLittle girl
 get up!\u201d The girl got right up and started walking around. Everyone was greatly surprised. ","But Jesus said
 \u201cProphets are honored by everyone
 except the people of their hometown and their relatives and their own family.\u201d ","Then he called together his twelve apostles and sent them out two by two with power over evil spirits.","When you are welcomed into a home
 stay there until you leave that town. ","If any place won\u2019t welcome you or listen to your message
 leave and shake the dust from your feet as a warning to them.\u201d","But when Herod heard about Jesus
 he said
 \u201cThis must be John! I had his head cut off
 and now he has come back to life.\u201d","The daughter of Herodias came in and danced for Herod and his guests. She pleased them so much that Herod said
 \u201cAsk for anything
 and it\u2019s yours! ","The girl left and asked her mother
 \u201cWhat do you think I should ask for?\u201d Her mother answered
 \u201cThe head of John the Baptist!\u201d","But so many people were coming and going that Jesus and the apostles did not even have a chance to eat. Then Jesus said
 \u201cLet\u2019s go to a place where we can be alone and get some rest.\u201d ","Jesus replied
 \u201cYou give them something to eat.\u201d But they asked him
 \u201cDon\u2019t you know that it would take almost a year\u2019s wages to buy all of these people something to eat?\u201d","Then Jesus said
 \u201cHow much bread do you have? Go and see!\u201d They found out and answered
 \u201cWe have five small loaves of bread and two fish.\u201d ","All of them saw him and were terrified. But at that same time he said
 \u201cDon\u2019t worry! I am Jesus. Don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d ","Jesus replied: You are nothing but show-offs! The prophet Isaiah was right when he wrote that God had said
 \u201cAll of you praise me with your words
 but you never really think about me.","It is useless for you to worship me
 when you teach rules made up by humans.\u201d","You disobey God\u2019s commands in order to obey what humans have taught.","You are good at rejecting God\u2019s commands so that you can follow your own teachings!","Didn\u2019t Moses command you to respect your father and mother? Didn\u2019t he tell you to put to death all who curse their parents?","But you let people get by without helping their parents when they should. You let them say that what they own has been offered to God.","You won\u2019t let those people help their parents.","And you ignore God\u2019s commands in order to follow your own teaching. You do a lot of other things that are just as bad.","Jesus called the crowd together again and said
 \u201cPay attention and try to understand what I mean. ","The food that you put into your mouth doesn\u2019t make you unclean and unfit to worship God. The bad words that come out of your mouth are what make you unclean.\u201d","He answered
 \u201cDon\u2019t you know what I am talking about by now? You surely know that the food you put into your mouth cannot make you unclean. ","It doesn\u2019t go into your heart
 but into your stomach
 and then out of your body.\u201d By saying this
 Jesus meant that all foods were fit to eat.","Then Jesus said: What comes from your heart is what makes you unclean.","Out of your heart come evil thoughts
 vulgar deeds
 stealing
 murder
 ","unfaithfulness in marriage
 greed
 meanness
 deceit
 indecency
 envy
 insults
 pride
 and foolishness. ","All of these come from your heart
 and they are what make you unfit to worship God.","But Jesus said
 \u201cThe children must first be fed! It isn\u2019t right to take away their food and feed it to dogs.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cThat\u2019s true! You may go now. The demon has left your daughter.\u201d ","Jesus looked up toward heaven
 and with a groan he said
 \u201cEffatha!\u201d which means \u201cOpen up!\u201d ","One day another large crowd gathered around Jesus. They had not brought along anything to eat. So Jesus called his disciples together and said
 ","\u201cI feel sorry for these people. They have been with me for three days
 and they don\u2019t have anything to eat. ","Some of them live a long way from here. If I send them away hungry
 they might faint on their way home.\u201d","Jesus asked them how much food they had. They replied
 \u201cSeven small loaves of bread.\u201d","Jesus groaned and said
 \u201cWhy are you always looking for a sign? I can promise you that you will not be given one!\u201d ","Jesus warned them
 \u201cWatch out! Guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and of Herod.\u201d","Jesus knew what they were thinking and asked
 \u201cWhy are you talking about not having any bread? Don\u2019t you understand? Are your minds still closed? ","Are your eyes blind and your ears deaf? Don\u2019t you remember","how many baskets of leftovers you picked up when I fed those five thousand people with only five small loaves of bread?\u201d \u201cYes
\u201d the disciples answered. \u201cThere were twelve baskets.\u201d","Jesus then asked
 \u201cAnd how many baskets of leftovers did you pick up when I broke seven small loaves of bread for those four thousand people?\u201d \u201cSeven
\u201d they answered.","\u201cDon\u2019t you know what I am talking about by now?\u201d Jesus asked.","Jesus took him by the hand and led him out of the village
 where he spit into the man\u2019s eyes. He placed his hands on the blind man and asked him if he could see anything. ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cYou may return home now
 but don\u2019t go into the village.\u201d","Jesus and his disciples went to the villages near the town of Caesarea Philippi. As they were walking along
 he asked them
 \u201cWhat do people say about me?\u201d","Then Jesus asked them
 \u201cBut who do you say I am?\u201d \u201cYou are the Messiah!\u201d Peter replied.","But when Jesus turned and saw the disciples
 he corrected Peter. He said to him
 \u201cSatan
 get away from me! You are thinking like everyone else and not like God.\u201d","Jesus then told the crowd and the disciples to come closer
 and he said: If any of you want to be my followers
 you must forget about yourself. You must take up your cross and follow me. ","If you want to save your life
 you will destroy it. But if you give up your life for me and for the good news
 you will save it. ","What will you gain
 if you own the whole world but destroy yourself? ","What could you give to get back your soul?","Don\u2019t be ashamed of me and my message among these unfaithful and sinful people! If you are
 the Son of Man will be ashamed of you when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.","I can assure you that some of the people standing here will not die before they see God\u2019s kingdom come with power.","Peter said to Jesus
 \u201cTeacher
 it is good for us to be here! Let us make three shelters
 one for you
 one for Moses

 as the Scriptures say they would.","Jesus asked
 \u201cWhat are you arguing about?\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cYou people don\u2019t have any faith! How much longer must I be with you? Why do I have to put up with you? Bring the boy to me.\u201d","Jesus asked the boy\u2019s father
 \u201cHow long has he been like this?\u201d The man answered
 \u201cEver since he was a child. ","Jesus replied
 \u201cWhy do you say \u2018if you can\u2019? Anything is possible for someone who has faith!\u201d","When Jesus saw that a crowd was gathering fast
 he spoke sternly to the evil spirit that had kept the boy from speaking or hearing. He said
 \u201cI order you to come out of the boy! Don\u2019t ever bother him again.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cOnly prayer can force out that kind of demon.\u201d","because he was teaching the disciples that the Son of Man would be handed over to people who would kill him. But three days later he would rise to life.","Jesus and his disciples went to his home in Capernaum. After they were inside the house
 Jesus asked them
 \u201cWhat were you arguing about along the way?\u201d ","After Jesus sat down and told the twelve disciples to gather around him
 he said
 \u201cIf you want the place of honor
 you must become a slave and serve others!\u201d","Then Jesus had a child stand near him. He put his arm around the child and said
 ","Jesus said to his disciples: Don\u2019t stop him! No one who works miracles in my name will soon turn and say something bad about me.","Anyone who isn\u2019t against us is for us.","And anyone who gives you a cup of water in my name
 just because you belong to me
 will surely be rewarded.","It will be terrible for people who cause even one of my little followers to sin. Those people would be better off thrown into the ocean with a heavy stone tied around their necks.","So if your hand causes you to sin
 cut it off! You would be better off to go into life crippled than to have two hands and be thrown into the fires of hell that never go out. ","If your foot causes you to sin
 chop it off. You would be better off to go into life lame than to have two feet and be thrown into hell. ","If your eye causes you to sin
 get rid of it. You would be better off to go into God\u2019s kingdom with only one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell. ","The worms there never die
 and the fire never stops burning.","Everyone must be salted with fire.","Salt is good. But if it no longer tastes like salt
 how can it be made salty again? Have salt among you and live at peace with each other.","Jesus asked them
 \u201cWhat does the Law of Moses say about that?\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cMoses gave you this law because you are so heartless. ","But in the beginning God made a man and a woman.","That\u2019s why a man leaves his father and mother and gets married.","He becomes like one person with his wife. Then they are no longer two people
 but one. ","And no one should separate a couple that God has joined together.\u201d","He told them
 \u201cA man who divorces his wife and marries someone else is unfaithful to his wife. ","A woman who divorces her husband and marries again is also unfaithful.\u201d","When Jesus saw this
 he became angry and said
 \u201cLet the children come to me! Don\u2019t try to stop them. People who are like these little children belong to the kingdom of God. ","I promise you that you cannot get into God\u2019s kingdom
 unless you accept it the way a child does.\u201d ","Jesus replied
 \u201cWhy do you call me good? Only God is good. ","You know the commandments. \u2018Do not murder. Be faithful in marriage. Do not steal. Do not tell lies about others. Do not cheat. Respect your father and mother.\u2019\u201d","The man answered
 \u201cTeacher
 I have obeyed all these commandments since I was a young man.\u201d","Jesus looked closely at the man. He liked him and said
 \u201cThere\u2019s one thing you still need to do. Go sell everything you own. Give the money to the poor
 and you will have riches in heaven. Then come with me.\u201d","Jesus looked around and said to his disciples
 \u201cIt\u2019s hard for rich people to get into God\u2019s kingdom!\u201d ","The disciples were shocked to hear this. So Jesus told them again
 \u201cIt\u2019s terribly hard to get into God\u2019s kingdom! ","In fact
 it\u2019s easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to get into God\u2019s kingdom.\u201d","Jesus' disciples were even more amazed. They asked each other
 \u201cHow can anyone ever be saved?\u201d","Jesus looked at them and said
 \u201cThere are some things that people cannot do
 but God can do anything.\u201d","Jesus told him: You can be sure that anyone who gives up home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or land for me and for the good news","will be rewarded. In this world they will be given a hundred times as many houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and pieces of land
 though they will also be mistreated. And in the world to come
 they will have eternal life. ","But many who are now first will be last
 and many who are now last will be first.","We are now on our way to Jerusalem where the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the teachers of the Law of Moses. They will sentence him to death and hand him over to foreigners
 ","who will make fun of him and spit on him. They will beat him and kill him. But three days later he will rise to life.","James and John
 the sons of Zebedee
 came up to Jesus and asked
 \u201cTeacher
 will you do us a favor?\u201d","Jesus asked them what they wanted
 ","Jesus told them
 \u201cYou don\u2019t really know what you\u2019re asking! Are you able to drink from the cup that I must soon drink from or be baptized as I must be baptized?\u201d","\u201cYes
 we are!\u201d James and John answered. Then Jesus replied
 \u201cYou certainly will drink from the cup from which I must drink. And you will be baptized just as I must! ","But it isn\u2019t for me to say who will sit at my right side and at my left. That is for God to decide.\u201d","But Jesus called the disciples together and said: You know that those foreigners who call themselves kings like to order their people around. And their great leaders have full power over the people they rule.","But don\u2019t act like them. If you want to be great
 you must be the servant of all the others. ","And if you want to be first
 you must be everyone\u2019s slave. ","The Son of Man did not come to be a slave master
 but a slave who will give his life to rescue many people.","Jesus stopped and said
 \u201cCall him over!\u201d They called out to the blind man and said
 \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid! Come on! He is calling for you.\u201d ","Jesus asked
 \u201cWhat do you want me to do for you?\u201d The blind man answered
 \u201cMaster
 I want to see!\u201d","Jesus told him
 \u201cYou may go. Your eyes are healed because of your faith.\u201d Right away the man could see
 and he went down the road with Jesus.","He told them
 \u201cGo into the next village. As soon as you enter it
 you will find a young donkey that has never been ridden. Untie the donkey and bring it here. ","If anyone asks why you are doing that
 say
 \u2018The Lord needs it and will soon bring it back.\u2019\u201d","So Jesus said to the tree
 \u201cNever again will anyone eat fruit from this tree!\u201d The disciples heard him say this.","Then he taught the people and said
 \u201cThe Scriptures say
 \u2018My house should be called a place of worship for all nations.\u2019 But you have made it a place where robbers hide!\u201d","Jesus told his disciples: Have faith in God!","If you have faith in God and don\u2019t doubt
 you can tell this mountain to get up and jump into the sea

 if you only have faith.","Whenever you stand up to pray
 you must forgive what others have done to you. Then your Father in heaven will forgive your sins.","Jesus answered
 \u201cI have just one question to ask you. If you answer it
 I will tell you where I got the right to do these things. ","Who gave John the right to baptize? Was it God in heaven or merely some human being?\u201d","and told Jesus
 \u201cWe don\u2019t know.\u201d Jesus replied
 \u201cThen I won\u2019t tell you who gave me the right to do what I do.\u201d","Jesus then told them this story: A farmer once planted a vineyard. He built a wall around it and dug a pit to crush the grapes in. He also built a lookout tower. Then he rented out his vineyard and left the country.","When it was harvest time
 he sent a servant to get his share of the grapes. ","The renters grabbed the servant. They beat him up and sent him away without a thing.","The owner sent another servant

 and they killed him. He kept sending servant after servant. They beat some of them and killed others.","The owner had a son he loved very much. Finally
 he sent his son to the renters because he thought they would respect him. ","But they said to themselves
 \u201cSomeday he will own this vineyard. Let\u2019s kill him! That way we can have it all for ourselves.\u201d ","So they grabbed the owner\u2019s son and killed him. Then they threw his body out of the vineyard.","Jesus asked
 \u201cWhat do you think the owner of the vineyard will do? He will come and kill those renters and let someone else have his vineyard. ","You surely know that the Scriptures say
 \u2018The stone that the builders tossed aside is now the most important stone of all.","This is something the Lord has done
 and it is amazing to us.\u2019\u201d","The Pharisees got together with Herod\u2019s followers. Then they sent some men to trick Jesus into saying something wrong.","Jesus knew what they were up to

 but of the living. You Sadducees are all wrong.","One of the teachers of the Law of Moses came up while Jesus and the Sadducees were arguing. When he heard Jesus give a good answer

 he told him
 \u201cYou are not far from God\u2019s kingdom.\u201d After this
 no one dared ask Jesus any more questions.","As Jesus was teaching in the temple
 he said
 \u201cHow can the teachers of the Law of Moses say that the Messiah will come from the family of King David? ","The Holy Spirit led David to say
 \u2018The Lord said to my Lord: Sit at my right side until I make your enemies into a footstool for you.\u2019","If David called the Messiah his Lord

 he will make the time shorter.","If someone should say
 \u201cHere is the Messiah!\u201d or \u201cThere he is!\u201d don\u2019t believe it. ","False messiahs and false prophets will come and work miracles and signs.

 they dried up. ","Others fell among thorn bushes

 increased in size
 and produced 30

 \u201cLet the person who has ears to hear
 listen!\u201d","He told them

 otherwise they might turn around and be forgiven.\u2019\u201d","Then he told them
 \u201cYou don\u2019t understand this parable

 Satan immediately comes and takes away the word that was sown in them. ","Others are like the seeds sown on the stony ground. When they hear the word
 at once they joyfully accept it
 ","but since they don\u2019t have any roots
 they last for only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes along because of the word
 they immediately fall away. ","Still others are like the seeds sown among the thorn bushes. These are the people who hear the word
 ","but the worries of life
 the deceitful pleasures of wealth
 and the desires for other things come in and choke the word so that it can\u2019t produce a crop. ","Others are like the seeds sown on good soil. They hear the word
 accept it
 and produce crops\u201430
 60
 or 100 times what was sown.\u201d","Then Jesus told them
 \u201cA lamp isn\u2019t brought indoors to be put under a basket or under a bed

 and nothing is secret except for the purpose of having it come to light. ","If anyone has ears to hear
 let him listen!","He went on to say to them
 \u201cPay attention to what you\u2019re hearing! You will be evaluated by the same standard with which you do your evaluating

 will have more given to him. But whoever has nothing
 even what he has will be taken away.\u201d","He was also saying
 \u201cThe kingdom of God is like a man who scatters seeds on the ground. ","He sleeps and gets up night and day while the seeds sprout and grow
 although he doesn\u2019t know how ","the ground produces grain by itself\u2014first the stalk
 then the head
 then the full grain in the head. ","But when the grain is ripe
 he immediately starts cutting with his sickle because the harvest time has come.\u201d","He was also saying
 \u201cHow can we show what the kingdom of God is like

 ","when it\u2019s planted it comes up and becomes larger than all the garden plants. It grows such large branches that the birds in the sky can nest in its shade.\u201d","That day
 when evening had come
 he told them
 \u201cLet\u2019s cross to the other side.\u201d ","Then he got up
 rebuked the wind

 \u201cMy name is Legion

 he told him
 \u201cGo home to your family

 \u201cIf I can just touch his robe
 I will get well.\u201d ","His disciples asked him
 \u201cYou see the crowd jostling you
 and yet you ask
 \u2018Who touched me?\u2019\u201d ","He told her
 \u201cDaughter

 \u201cWhenever you go into a home

 \u201cWhat should I ask for?\u201d Her mother replied

 \u201cAre you so ignorant? Don\u2019t you know that nothing that goes into a person from the outside can make him unclean? ","Because it doesn\u2019t go into his heart but into his stomach

 tear it out. It\u2019s better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell. ","In that place
 worms never die
 and the fire is never put out.","Because everyone will be salted with fire
 and every sacrifice will be salted with salt. ","Salt is good. But if salt loses its taste
 how can you restore its flavor? Keep on having salt among yourselves
 and live in peace with one another.\u201d","\u201cWhat did Moses command you?\u201d he responded.","But Jesus told them
 \u201cIt was because of your hardness of heart that he wrote this command for you. ","But from the beginning of creation
 \u2018God made them male and female.\u2019 ","That\u2019s why \u2018a man will leave his father and mother and be united with his wife
 ","and the two will become one flesh.\u2019 So they\u2019re no longer two
 but one flesh. ","Therefore
 what God has joined together
 man must never separate.\u201d","So he told them
 \u201cWhoever divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her. ","And if a woman divorces her husband and marries another man
 she commits adultery.\u201d","When Jesus saw this
 he became furious and told them
 \u201cLet the little children come to me
 and stop keeping them away
 because the kingdom of God belongs to people like these. ","I tell all of you with certainty
 whoever doesn\u2019t receive the kingdom of God as a little child will never enter it.\u201d ","\u201cWhy do you call me good?\u201d Jesus asked him. \u201cNobody is good except for one\u2014God.","You know the commandments: \u2018Never murder.\u2019 \u2018Never commit adultery.\u2019 \u2018Never steal.\u2019 \u2018Never give false testimony.\u2019 \u2018Never cheat.\u2019 \u2018Honor your father and mother.\u2019\u201d","The man replied to him
 \u201cTeacher
 I have obeyed all of these since I was a young man.\u201d","Jesus looked at him and loved him. Then he told him
 \u201cYou\u2019re missing one thing. Go and sell everything you own
 give the money to the destitute
 and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come back and follow me.\u201d ","Then Jesus looked around and told his disciples
 \u201cHow hard it will be for those who are wealthy to enter the kingdom of God!\u201d ","The disciples were startled by these words
 but Jesus told them again
 \u201cChildren
 how hard it is for those who trust in their wealth to get into the kingdom of God! ","It\u2019s easier for a camel to squeeze through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to get into the kingdom of God.\u201d","The disciples were utterly amazed and asked one another
 \u201cThen who can be saved?\u201d","Jesus looked at them intently and said
 \u201cFor humans it\u2019s impossible
 but not for God. All things are possible for God.\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cI tell all of you with certainty
 there is no one who has left his home
 brothers
 sisters
 mother
 father
 children
 or fields because of me and the gospel ","who will not receive a hundred times as much here in this world\u2014homes
 brothers
 sisters
 mothers
 children
 and fields

 and the last will be first.\u201d","\u201cPay attention! We\u2019re going up to Jerusalem. The Son of Man will be handed over to the high priests and the scribes
 and they\u2019ll condemn him to death. Then they\u2019ll hand him over to the unbelievers
 ","and they\u2019ll make fun of him
 spit on him
 whip him
 and kill him. But after three days he\u2019ll be raised.\u201d","James and John
 the sons of Zebedee
 went to Jesus and told him
 \u201cTeacher
 we want you to do for us whatever we ask you.\u201d","He asked them
 \u201cWhat do you want me to do for you?\u201d","But Jesus told them
 \u201cYou don\u2019t realize what you\u2019re asking. Can you drink from the cup that I\u2019m going to drink from or be baptized with the baptism with which I\u2019m going to be baptized?\u201d","They told him
 \u201cWe can.\u201d Jesus told them
 \u201cYou will drink from the cup that I\u2019m going to drink and be baptized with the baptism with which I\u2019m going to be baptized. ","But it\u2019s not up to me to grant you a seat at my right or my left. Those positions have already been prepared for others.\u201d","Jesus called his disciples and told them
 \u201cYou know that those who are recognized as rulers among the unbelievers lord it over them
 and their superiors act like tyrants over them. ","That\u2019s not the way it should be among you. Instead
 whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant
 ","and whoever wants to be first among you must be a slave to everyone
 ","because even the Son of Man did not come to be served
 but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many people.\u201d","So Jesus stopped and said
 \u201cCall him!\u201d So they called the blind man and told him
 \u201cHave courage! Get up. He\u2019s calling you.\u201d ","Then Jesus asked him
 \u201cWhat do you want me to do for you?\u201d The blind man told him
 \u201cRabbouni
 I want to see again.\u201d","Jesus told him
 \u201cGo. Your faith has made you well.\u201d At once the man could see again
 and he began to follow Jesus down the road.","and told them
 \u201cGo into the village ahead of you. As soon as you go into it
 you will find a colt tied up that no one has ever ridden. Untie it
 and bring it along. ","If anyone asks you
 \u2018Why are you doing this?
\u2019 say
 \u2018The Lord needs it
\u2019 and he will send it back here at once.\u201d","So he told it
 \u201cMay no one ever eat fruit from you again!\u201d Now his disciples were listening to this.","Then he began to teach them: \u201cIt is written
 is it not
 \u2018My house is to be called a house of prayer for all nations\u2019? But you\u2019ve turned it into a hideout for bandits!\u201d ","Jesus told his disciples
 \u201cHave faith in God! ","I tell all of you with certainty
 if anyone says to this mountain
 \u2018Be lifted up and thrown into the sea
\u2019 if he doesn\u2019t doubt in his heart but believes that what he says will happen
 it will be done for him. ","That is why I tell you
 whatever you ask for in prayer
 believe that you have received it and it will be yours.","\u201cWhenever you stand up to pray
 forgive whatever you have against anyone
 so that your Father in heaven will forgive your sins. ","Jesus told them
 \u201cI\u2019ll ask you one question. Answer me
 and then I\u2019ll tell you by what authority I\u2019m doing these things. ","Was John\u2019s authority to baptize from heaven or from humans? Answer me.\u201d","So they answered Jesus
 \u201cWe don\u2019t know.\u201d Then Jesus told them
 \u201cThen I won\u2019t tell you by what authority I\u2019m doing these things.\u201d","Then Jesus began to speak to them in parables. \u201cA man planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it
 dug a pit for the wine press
 and built a watchtower. Then he leased it to tenant farmers and went abroad. ","At the right time
 he sent a servant to the farmers to collect from them a share of the produce from the vineyard. ","But the farmers grabbed the servant
 beat him
 and sent him back empty-handed. ","Again
 the man sent another servant to them. They beat the servant over the head and treated him shamefully. ","Then the man sent another
 and that one they killed. So it was with many other servants. Some of these they beat
 and others they killed. ","He still had one more person to send
 a son whom he loved. Finally
 he sent him to them
 saying
 \u2018They will respect my son.\u2019 ","But those farmers told one another
 \u2018This is the heir. Come on
 let\u2019s kill him
 and the inheritance will be ours!\u2019 ","So they grabbed him
 killed him
 and threw him out of the vineyard.","\u201cNow what will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come
 execute the farmers
 and give the vineyard to others. ","Haven\u2019t you ever read this Scripture: \u2018The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone.","This was the Lord\u2019s doing
 and it is amazing in our eyes\u2019?\u201d","Then they sent some Pharisees and some Herodians to him
 intending to trap him in what he said. ","Seeing through their hypocrisy
 Jesus replied to them
 \u201cWhy are you testing me? Bring me a denarius and let me look at it.\u201d","So they brought one. Then he asked them
 \u201cWhose face and name are on this?\u201d They told him
 \u201cCaesar\u2019s.\u201d","So Jesus told them
 \u201cGive back to Caesar the things that are Caesar\u2019s
 and to God the things that are God\u2019s.\u201d And they were utterly amazed at him.","Jesus answered them
 \u201cAren\u2019t you mistaken because you don\u2019t know the Scriptures or God\u2019s power? ","When people rise from the dead
 they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are like the angels in heaven. ","As for the dead being raised
 haven\u2019t you read in the book of Moses
 in the story about the bush
 how God said
 \u2018I am the God of Abraham
 the God of Isaac
 and the God of Jacob\u2019? ","He is not the God of the dead
 but of the living. You are badly mistaken!\u201d","Then one of the scribes came near and heard the Sadducees arguing with one another. He saw how well Jesus answered them
 so he asked him
 \u201cWhich commandment is the most important of them all?\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cThe most important is
 \u2018Hear
 O Israel
 the Lord our God is one Lord
 ","and you must love the Lord your God with all your heart
 with all your soul
 with all your mind
 and with all your strength.\u2019 ","The second is this: \u2018You must love your neighbor as yourself.\u2019 No other commandment is greater than these.\u201d","When Jesus saw how wisely the man answered
 he told him
 \u201cYou are not far from the kingdom of God.\u201d After that
 no one dared to ask him another question.","While Jesus was teaching in the Temple
 he asked
 \u201cHow can the scribes say that the Messiah is David\u2019s son? ","David himself said by the Holy Spirit
 \u2018The Lord told my Lord
 \u201cSit at my right hand
 until I put your enemies under your feet.\u201d\u2019","David himself calls him \u2018Lord
\u2019 so how can he be his son?\u201d And the large crowd kept listening to him with delight.","As he taught
 he said
 \u201cBeware of the scribes! They like to walk around in long robes
 to be greeted in the marketplaces
 ","and to have the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets.","They devour widows\u2019 houses and say long prayers to cover it up. They will receive greater condemnation!\u201d","He called his disciples and told them
 \u201cI tell all of you with certainty
 this destitute widow has dropped in more than everyone who is contributing to the offering box
 ","because all of them contributed out of their surplus
 but out of her poverty she has given everything she had to live on.\u201d","While Jesus was leaving the Temple
 one of his disciples told him
 \u201cLook
 Teacher! What stones! And what buildings!\u201d","\u201cDo you see these large buildings?\u201d Jesus responded. \u201cNot even a single stone here will be left on top of another that won\u2019t be demolished.\u201d","Jesus began by telling them
 \u201cSee to it that no one deceives you. ","Many will come in my name
 proclaiming
 \u2018I AM
\u2019 and they will deceive many people. ","But when you hear of wars and rumors of wars
 don\u2019t panic. These things must take place
 but the end won\u2019t have come yet
 ","because nation will rise up in arms against nation
 and kingdom against kingdom. Furthermore
 there will be earthquakes and famines in various places. These things are only a beginning of agonies.\u201d","\u201cAs for yourselves
 be on your guard! People will hand you over to local councils
 and you will be beaten in their synagogues. You will stand before governors and kings in order to testify to them because of me. ","But first
 the gospel must be proclaimed to all nations. ","When they take you away and hand you over for trial
 don\u2019t worry ahead of time about what you will say. Instead
 say whatever is given to you at that time
 because it won\u2019t be you speaking
 but the Holy Spirit. ","Brother will betray brother to death
 and a father his child. Children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death. ","You will be hated continuously by everyone on account of my name. But the person who endures to the end will be saved.\u201d","\u201cSo when you see the destructive desecration standing where it should not be (let the reader take note)
 then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains. ","Anyone who\u2019s on his housetop must not come down and go into his house to take anything out of it
 ","and the one who\u2019s in the field must not turn back to get his coat.","\u201cHow terrible it will be for women who are pregnant or who are nursing babies in those days!","Pray that it may not be in winter
 ","because those days will be a time of suffering
 a kind that has not happened from the beginning of creation\u2014which God himself created\u2014until now
 and certainly will never happen again. ","If the Lord had not shortened those days
 no one would survive. But for the sake of the elect whom he has chosen
 he has shortened those days.","\u201cAt that time
 if anyone says to you
 \u2018Look here! The Messiah!\u2019
 or
 \u2018Look there!\u2019 don\u2019t believe it
 ","because false messiahs and false prophets will have arisen and will produce signs and omens intending to deceive
 if possible
 the elect. ","So be on your guard! I\u2019ve told you everything beforehand.\u201d","\u201cBut after the troubles of those days
 \u2018The sun will be darkened
 the moon will not reflect its light
","the stars will be falling out of the sky
 and the powers that are in the heavens will be disrupted.\u2019","Then people will see \u2018the Son of Man coming in clouds\u2019 with great power and glory.","He\u2019ll send out the angels and gather his elect from the four winds
 from the most remote part of earth to the most remote part of heaven.\u201d","\u201cNow learn a lesson from the fig tree. When its branches become tender and it produces leaves
 you know that summer is approaching. ","In the same way
 when you see these things taking place
 you will know that the Son of Man is near
 right at the door. ","I tell all of you with certainty
 this generation won\u2019t disappear until all these things take place. ","Heaven and earth will disappear
 but my words will never disappear.\u201d","\u201cNo one knows when that day or hour will come\u2014neither the angels in heaven nor the Son
 but only the Father. ","Be careful! Watch out! Because you don\u2019t know when the time will come.","It\u2019s like a man who went on a trip. As he left home
 he put his servants in charge
 each with his own work
 and he ordered the doorkeeper to be alert. ","So keep on watching
 because you don\u2019t know when the master of the house is coming\u2014whether in the middle of the night
 at the time the cock crows
 or at daybreak. ","Otherwise
 he may come suddenly and find you asleep. ","I\u2019m telling you what I\u2019m telling everyone: Be alert!\u201d","Irritated
 some who were there asked one another
 \u201cWhy was the perfume wasted like this? ","But Jesus said
 \u201cLeave her alone. Why are you bothering her? She has done a beautiful thing for me
 ","because you\u2019ll always have the destitute with you and can help them whenever you want
 but you won\u2019t always have me. ","She has done what she could. She poured perfume on my body in preparation for my burial.","I tell all of you with certainty
 wherever the gospel is proclaimed in the whole world
 what she has done will also be told as a memorial to her.\u201d","He sent two of his disciples
 telling them
 \u201cGo into the city

 say to its owner that the Teacher asks
 \u2018Where is my room where I can eat the Passover meal with my disciples?\u2019 ","Then he will show you a large upstairs room that is furnished and ready. Get everything ready for us there.\u201d","While they were at the table eating
 Jesus said
 \u201cI tell all of you with certainty
 one of you is going to betray me
 one who is eating with me.\u201d","He told them
 \u201cIt\u2019s one of you Twelve

 just as it has been written about him
 but how terrible it will be for that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for him if he had never been born.\u201d","While they were eating
 Jesus took a loaf of bread and blessed it. Then he broke it in pieces and handed it to them
 saying
 \u201cTake some. This is my body.\u201d ","He told them
 \u201cThis is my blood of the covenant that is being poured out for many people. ","I tell all of you with certainty
 I\u2019ll never again drink the product of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.\u201d","Then Jesus told them
 \u201cAll of you will turn against me

 \u2018I will strike the shepherd
 and the sheep will be scattered.\u2019","However
 after I\u2019ve been raised
 I\u2019ll go to Galilee ahead of you.\u201d","Jesus told him
 \u201cI tell you with certainty
 today

 \u201cAbba! Father! All things are possible for you. Take this cup away from me. Yet not what I want but what you want.\u201d","When he went back
 he found his disciples asleep. \u201cSimon
 are you asleep?\u201d he asked Peter. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t stay awake for one hour
 could you? ","All of you must stay awake and pray that you won\u2019t be tempted. The spirit is indeed willing

 the one who is betraying me is near!\u201d","Jesus asked them
 \u201cHave you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me as if I were a bandit? ","Day after day I was with you in the Temple teaching

 \u201cProphesy!\u201d Even the servants took him and slapped him around.","Just then a rooster crowed a second time. Peter remembered that Jesus told him
 \u201cBefore a rooster crows twice

 saying
 Be silent
 and come out of him.","And when they had found him
 they said unto him
 All men seek for thee.","And he said unto them
 Let us go into the next towns that I may preach there also

 having mercy on him
 put forth his hand and touched him and said unto him
 I will; be thou clean.","and said unto him
 See thou say nothing to any man
 but go
 show thyself to the priest
 and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded
 for a testimony unto them.","When Jesus saw their faith
 he said unto the paralytic
 Son
 thy sins are forgiven thee.","And Jesus
 knowing afterward in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves
 said unto them
 Why think ye these things in your hearts?","What is easier to say to the paralytic
 Thy sins are forgiven thee
 or to say
 Arise and take up thy bed and walk?","But that ye may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins (he spoke to the sick of the palsy)
","I say unto thee
 Arise and take up thy bed and go to thy house.","And as he passed by
 he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom and said unto him
 Follow me. And he arose and followed him.","When Jesus heard it
 he said unto them
 They that are whole have no need of the physician

 but the sinners to repentance.","And Jesus said unto them
 Can those who are in a wedding fast while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them
 they cannot fast.","But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them

 and the wine is spilled
 and the wineskins are lost; but new wine must be poured into new wineskins.","And the Pharisees said unto him
 Behold
 why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful?","And he said unto them
 Have ye never read what David did when he had need and was hungry
 he and those that were with him?","And he said unto them
 The sabbath was made for man
 and not man for the sabbath;","therefore the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath.","So he said unto the man who had the withered hand
 Stand forth.","And he said unto them
 Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days or to do evil? to save the person or to kill them? But they were silent.","And looking round about on them with anger
 being grieved for the blindness of their hearts
 he said unto the man
 Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it out and his hand was restored whole as the other.","And he called them unto him and said unto them in parables
 How can Satan cast out Satan?","If a kingdom is divided against itself
 that kingdom cannot remain.","And if a house is divided against itself
 that house cannot remain.","And if Satan rises up against himself and is divided
 he cannot remain

 Who is my mother or my brethren?","And looking round about on those who sat about him

 it was scorched
 and because it had no root
 it withered away.","And some fell among thorns

 and it yielded no fruit.","And other fell on good ground and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased and brought forth: some thirty and some sixty and some a hundred.","And he said unto them
 He that has ears to hear
 let him hear.","And he said unto them
 Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God; but unto those that are without
 all these things are done in parables

 and their sins should be forgiven them.","And he said unto them
 Know ye not this parable? How then will ye understand all the parables?","The sower is he who sows the word.","And these are those by the way side
 in whom the word is sown

 Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in their hearts.","And likewise these are those who are sown on stony ground

 Is the lamp brought to be put under the bushel or under the bed? and not to be set in the lampstand?","For there is nothing hid which shall not be manifested; nor secret which shall not be exposed.","If anyone has ears to hear
 let him hear.","And he also said unto them
 Take heed what ye hear; with the measure ye measure by
 ye shall be measured by others
 and unto you that hear shall more be added.","For he that has
 to him shall be given; and he that has not
 from him shall be taken even that which he has.","He also said
 So is the kingdom of God
 as if a man should cast seed into the ground","and should sleep and rise night and day
 and the seed should spring forth and grow up
 he knows not how.","For the earth brings forth fruit of herself: first the blade
 then the ear
 after that the full grain in the ear.","But when the fruit is brought forth
 immediately he puts in the sickle because the harvest is come.","He also said
 Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? Or with what parable shall we compare it?","It is like a grain of mustard seed
 which
 when it is sown in the earth
 is less than all the seeds that are in the earth;","but when it is sown
 it grows up and becomes greater than all herbs and shoots out great branches
 so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.","And that same day
 when evening was come
 he said unto them
 Let us pass over unto the other side.","And as he arose
 he rebuked the wind and said unto the sea
 Peace
 be still. And the wind ceased
 and there was a great calm.","And he said unto them
 Why are ye so fearful? How is it that ye have no faith?","For he said unto him
 Come out of the man
 thou unclean spirit.","And he asked him
 What is thy name? And he answered
 saying
 My name is Legion
 for we are many.","But Jesus suffered him not but said unto him
 Go home to thy friends and family and tell them what great things the Lord has done with thee and how he has had mercy on thee.","For she said
 If I may touch but his clothes
 I shall be saved.","And his disciples said unto him
 Thou seest the multitude thronging thee and sayest thou
 Who touched me?","And he said unto her
 Daughter
 thy faith has made thee saved; go in peace and remain whole of thy plague.","As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken
 he said unto the prince of the synagogue
 Be not afraid
 only believe.","And when he was come in
 he said unto them
 Why make ye this ado and weep? The damsel is not dead
 but sleeps.","And taking the damsel by the hand
 he said unto her
 Talitha cumi
 which is
 being interpreted
 Damsel
 I say unto thee
 arise.","But Jesus said unto them
 A prophet is not dishonoured except in his own country and among his own kin and in his own house.","And he called unto him the twelve and began to send them forth by two and two and gave them power over the unclean spirits","And he said unto them
 In whatever place ye enter into a house
 there abide until ye depart from that place.","And whosoever shall not receive you nor hear you
 when ye depart from there
 shake off the dust under your feet in testimony against them. Verily I say unto you
 It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment than for that city.","But when Herod heard of it
 he said
 This is John
 whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead.","and when the daughter of Herodias came in and danced and pleased Herod and those that sat with him
 the king said unto the damsel
 Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt
 and I will give it unto thee.","And she went forth
 and said unto her mother
 What shall I ask? And she said
 The head of John the Baptist.","And he said unto them
 Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place and rest a while; for there were many coming and going
 and they had no leisure so much as to eat.","He answered and said unto them
 Give ye them to eat. And they said unto him
 Shall we go and buy bread for two hundred denarius and give them to eat?","He said unto them
 How many loaves have ye? go and see. And when they knew
 they said
 Five
 and two fishes.","For they all saw him and were troubled. And immediately he talked with them and said unto them
 Be of good cheer; I AM; be not afraid.","He answered and said unto them
 Well has Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites
 as it is written
 This people honours me with their lips
 but their heart is far from me.","Howbeit in vain do they honor me
 teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.","For laying aside the commandment of God
 ye hold the tradition of men as the washing of pots and cups
 and many other such like things ye do.","And he also said unto them
 Full well ye reject the commandment of God
 that ye may keep your own tradition.","For Moses said
 Honour thy father and thy mother
 and
 Whosoever curses father or mother shall most definitely die.","But ye say
 It is enough if a man shall say to his father or mother
 It is all Corban
 (that is to say
 my gift to God) whatever with which thou mightest be profited by me.","And ye suffer him to do no more for his father or for his mother
","invalidating the word of God with your tradition
 which ye have given; and many such like things do ye.","And when he had called all the people unto him
 he said unto them
 Hearken unto me every one of you and understand;","there is nothing from outside the man that entering into him can defile him
 but the things which come out of him
 those are what defile the man.","And he said unto them
 Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not understand that anything from outside that enters into the man cannot defile him?","Because it enters not into his heart
 but into the belly
 and the man goes out to the privy and purges all foods.","For he had said that it is what comes out of the man that defiles the man.","For from within
 out of the heart of men
 come forth the evil thoughts
 the adulteries
 the fornications
 the murders
","the thefts
 the covetousness
 the wickedness
 the deceit
 the lasciviousness
 the evil eye
 the slander
 the pride
 the unwiseness:","all these evil things come out from within and defile the man.","But Jesus said unto her
 Let the children first be filled
 for it is not good to take the children\u2019s bread and to cast it unto the dogs.","And he said unto her
 For this word go; the demon has gone out of thy daughter.","and looking up to heaven
 he cried out
 and said
 Ephphatha
 that is
 Be opened.","In those days
 as before
 there was a great multitude
 and they had nothing to eat; Jesus called his disciples unto him and said unto them
","I have mercy on the multitude because they have now been with me three days and have nothing to eat;","And if I send them away fasting to their own houses
 they will faint by the way
 for some of them came from afar.","And he asked them
 How many loaves have ye? And they said
 Seven.","And crying out in his spirit
 he said
 Why does this generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you
 There shall no sign be given unto this generation.","And he commanded them
 saying
 Take heed
 beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the leaven of Herod.","And as Jesus understood it
 he said unto them
 Why argue ye because ye have no bread? Do ye not consider nor understand? is your heart yet blind?","Having eyes
 see ye not? and having ears
 hear ye not? and do ye not remember?","When I broke the five loaves among five thousand
 how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They said unto him
 Twelve.","And when the seven loaves among four thousand
 how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? And they said
 Seven.","And he said unto them
 How is it that ye do not yet understand?","So
 taking the blind man by the hand
 he led him out of the town; and spitting into his eyes and putting his hands upon them
 he asked him if he saw anything.","And he sent him away to his house
 saying
 Neither go into the town
 nor tell it to any in the town.","And Jesus and his disciples went out into the towns of Caesarea Philippi; and by the way he asked his disciples
 saying unto them
 Who do men say that I am?","Then he said unto them
 But who say ye that I am? And Peter answered and said unto him
 Thou art the Christ!","And he
 turning about and looking at his disciples
 rebuked Peter
 saying
 Get thyself from me
 Satan
 for thou knowest not the things that are of God
 but the things that are of men.","And calling the multitude unto him with his disciples
 he said unto them
 Whosoever will come after me
 let him deny himself and take up his cross {Gr. stauros \u2013 stake} and follow me.","For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel\u2019s
 the same shall save it.","For what shall it profit a man
 if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul?","Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?","Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation
 of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.","He also said unto them
 Verily I say unto you
 That there are some of those who are here who shall not taste of death until they have seen the kingdom of God which comes with power.","Then Peter answering
 said unto Jesus
 Master
 it shall be good for us to remain here; and let us make three tabernacles: one for thee
 and another for Moses
 and another for Elijah.","And he answered and told them
 Elijah verily shall come first and restore all things and how it is written of the Son of man
 that he must suffer many things and be esteemed as nothing.","But I say unto you
 That Elijah has indeed come
 and they have done unto him whatsoever they wished
 as it is written of him.","And he asked the scribes
 What dispute ye with them?","Answering
 he said unto him
 O unfaithful generation
 how long shall I be with you? How long must I suffer you? Bring him unto me.","And Jesus asked his father
 How long ago is it since this came unto him? And he said
 Of a child.","And Jesus said unto him
 If thou canst believe this
 all things are possible to him that believes.","When Jesus saw that the multitude concurred
 he rebuked the unclean spirit
 saying unto him
 Thou dumb and deaf spirit
 I command thee
 come out of him and enter no more into him.","And he said unto them
 This kind can come forth by nothing
 but by prayer and fasting.","For he went on teaching his disciples and said unto them
 The Son of man is delivered into hands of men
 and they shall kill him; and after he is dead
 he shall rise the third day.","And he came to Capernaum; and being in the house he asked them
 What was it that ye disputed among yourselves on the way?","Then
 sitting down
 he called the twelve and said unto them
 If anyone desires to be first
 the same shall be last of all and servant of all.","And taking a child
 he set him in the midst of them; and taking him in his arms
 he said unto them
","But Jesus said
 Forbid him not
 for there is no one who does a miracle in my name that can then speak evil of me.","For he that is not against us is for us.","For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name because ye are of the Christ
 verily I say unto you
 he shall not lose his reward.","And whosoever shall be a stumbling block to one of these little ones that believe in me
 it would be better for him if a millstone were hanged about his neck
 and he were cast into the sea.","And if thy hand causes thee to fall
 cut it off; it is better for thee to enter into life maimed than having two hands to go into hell
 into the fire that can never be quenched
","And if thy foot causes thee to fall
 cut it off; it is better for thee to enter halt into life than having two feet to be cast into hell
 into the fire that can never be quenched
","And if thine eye causes thee to fall
 pluck it out; it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye than having two eyes to be cast into hell
","where their worm does not die
 and the fire is never quenched.","For every one shall be salted with fire
 and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.","Salt is good
 but if the salt has lost its saltness
 with what will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves
 and have peace one with another.","And he answered and said unto them
 What did Moses command you?","And Jesus answered and said unto them
 For the hardness of your heart he wrote you this commandment.","But at the beginning of the creation God made them male and female.","For this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall join to his wife;","and they that were two shall be made one flesh
 so then they are no longer two
 but one flesh.","Therefore what God has joined together
 let not man separate.","And he said unto them
 Whosoever shall put away his wife and marry another commits adultery against her.","And if the woman shall put away her husband and be married to another
 she commits adultery.","And Jesus seeing it
 became angry and said unto them
 Suffer the little children to come unto me and hinder them not
 for of such is the kingdom of God.","Verily I say unto you
 Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child
 he shall not enter therein.","And Jesus said unto him
 Why dost thou call me good? there is none good but one
 that is
 God.","Thou knowest the commandments: Do not commit adultery
 Do not murder
 Do not steal
 Do not bear false witness
 Defraud not
 Honour thy father and mother.","And he answered and said unto him
 Master
 all these I have observed from my youth.","Then Jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him
 One thing thou lackest: go
 sell all that thou hast and give to the poor
 and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come
 take up the cross
 {Gr. stauros \u2013 stake} and follow me taking up thy stake (if thy desire is to be perfect).","Then Jesus
 looking around
 said unto his disciples
 How hardly shall those that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!","And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus answered again and said unto them
 Children
 how hard is it for those that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!","It is easier to pass a cable through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.","But they were astonished even more
 saying in themselves
 Who then can save himself?","Then Jesus looking upon them said
 For men it is impossible
 but not for God because all things are possible for God.","And answering him
 Jesus said
 Verily I say unto you
 There is no one that has left house or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my sake and the gospel\u2019s","who shall not receive one hundredfold now in this time: houses and brethren and sisters and mothers and children and lands
 with persecutions
 and in the world to come eternal life.","But many of the first shall be last; and of the last first.","saying
 Behold
 we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the princes of the priests and unto the scribes
 and they shall condemn him to death and shall deliver him to the Gentiles
","and they shall mock him and shall scourge him and shall spit upon him and shall kill him; but the third day he shall rise again.","Then James and John
 the sons of Zebedee
 came unto him
 saying
 Master
 we would that thou should do for us whatever we shall ask.","And he said unto them
 What would ye that I should do for you?","Then Jesus said unto them
 Ye know not what ye ask; can ye drink the cup that I drink? Or be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?","And they said unto him
 We can. And Jesus said unto them
 Ye shall indeed drink the cup that I drink
 and of the baptism that I am baptized with ye shall be baptized;","but to sit at my right hand and at my left hand is not mine to give
 but it shall be given to those for whom it is prepared.","But Jesus
 calling unto them
 said unto them
 Ye know that those who are seen to be princes among the Gentiles exercise lordship over them
 and those that are great among them wield power over them.","But it shall not be like this among you
 for whosoever desires to make himself great among you shall be your servant;","and whosoever of you that desires to be first shall be slave of all.","For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto
 but to serve and to give his life in ransom for many.","Then Jesus stood still and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man
 saying unto him
 Have confidence
 rise; he calls thee.","And Jesus
 answering
 said unto him
 What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? And the blind man said unto him
 Master
 that I might receive my sight.","And Jesus said unto him
 Go; thy faith has saved thee. And immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus in the way.","and said unto them
 Go to the place which is before you; and as soon as ye are entered into it
 ye shall find a colt tied
 upon which no man ever sat; loose him and bring him.","And if anyone says unto you
 Why do ye this? say ye that the Lord has need of him
 and straightway he will send him here.","Then Jesus
 answering
 said to the fig tree
 Never again shall anyone eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever. And his disciples heard it.","And he taught them
 saying
 Is it not written that my house shall be called house of prayer by all the nations? but ye have made it a den of thieves.","And Jesus
 answering
 said unto them
 Have faith in God.","For verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain
 Remove thyself and cast thyself into the sea
 and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that what he says shall be done whatsoever he says shall be done unto him.","Therefore I say unto you that everything that ye ask for
 praying
 believe that ye receive it
 and it shall come upon you.","And when ye are praying
 forgive if ye have anything against anyone
 so that your Father who is in the heavens will also forgive you your trespasses.","Then Jesus
 answering
 said unto them
 I will also ask of you one word
 and respond unto me
 and I will tell you with what faculty I do these things.","The baptism of John
 was it of heaven or of men? Respond unto me.","And answering
 they said unto Jesus
 We do not know. And Jesus
 answering
 said unto them
 Neither shall I tell you with what faculty I do these things.","And he began to speak unto them by parables. A certain man planted a vineyard and set a hedge about it and dug a place for the winefat {Place where grapes are tread} and built a tower and let it out to husbandmen and went far away.","And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a slave that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.","And taking him
 they beat him and sent him away empty.","And again he sent unto them another slave
 and casting stones at him
 they wounded him in the head and sent him away shamefully handled.","And again he sent another
 and him they killed and many others
 beating some and killing some.","Having yet therefore one son
 his wellbeloved
 he sent him also last unto them
 saying
 They will reverence my son.","But those husbandmen said among themselves
 This is the heir; come
 let us kill him
 and the place shall be ours.","And taking hold of him
 they killed him and cast him out of the vineyard.","What
 therefore
 shall the lord of the vineyard do? He shall come and destroy those husbandmen and shall give his vineyard unto others.","And have ye not read this scripture: The stone which the builders rejected is placed as the head of the corner;","This was the Lord\u2019s doing
 and it is marvellous in our eyes?","And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians to catch him in his words.","Shall we give or shall we not give? Then he
 understanding their hypocrisy
 said unto them
 Why tempt ye me? Bring me the coin that I may see it.","And they brought it. And he said unto them
 Of whom is this image and inscription? And they said unto him
 Of Caesar.","And Jesus
 answering
 said unto them
 Render that which is of Caesar unto Caesar
 and that which is of God unto God. And they marvelled at this.","Then Jesus
 answering
 said unto them
 Do ye not therefore err because ye know not the scriptures
 neither the power of God?","For when they shall rise from the dead
 neither shall they marry nor husbands take women nor women
 husbands; but are as the angels who are in the heavens.","And regarding the dead who are to rise
 have ye not read in the book of Moses how in the bush God spoke unto him
 saying
 I Am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob?","He is not God of the dead
 but God of the living; ye therefore do greatly err.","And one of the scribes came
 having heard their dispute and knowing that he had given a good response unto them
 asked him
 Which is the principal commandment of all?","And Jesus responded unto him
 The principal of all the commandments is
 Hear
 O Israel
 The Lord our God
 the Lord is one;","and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy thought and with all thy strength: this is the principal commandment.","And the second is like it
 Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is no other commandment greater than these.","Then Jesus
 seeing that he responded wisely
 said unto him
 Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that dared ask him any question.","And answering
 Jesus said
 while he taught in the temple
 How do the scribes say that the Christ is Son of David?","For David himself said by the Holy Spirit
 The LORD said to my Lord
 Sit thou at my right hand
 until I make thine enemies thy footstool.","David therefore himself calls him Lord
 and where then is he his son? And the many people heard him gladly.","And he said unto them in his doctrine
 Beware of the scribes
 who love to go in long clothing and love the salutations in the marketplaces","and the first chairs in the synagogues and the first seats at the suppers
","which devour widows\u2019 houses and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater judgment.","Then calling his disciples
 he said unto them
 Verily I say unto you that this poor widow has cast more in than all those who have cast into the treasury
","for they all did cast in of their abundance
 but she of her want did cast in all that she had
 even all her living.","And as he went out of the temple
 one of his disciples said unto him
 Master
 see what manner of stones and what buildings are here!","And Jesus
 answering
 said unto him
 Seest thou these great buildings? There shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down.","And Jesus
 answering them
 began to say
 Take heed that no one deceive you
","for many shall come in my name
 saying
 I Am Christ
 and shall deceive many.","And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars
 be ye not troubled
 for such things must needs be; but the end shall not be yet.","For people shall rise against people and kingdom against kingdom
 and there shall be earthquakes in each place
 and there shall be famines and troubles: these shall be the beginnings of sorrows.","But take heed to yourselves
 for they shall deliver you up in the councils
 and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten; and ye shall be called before rulers and kings for my sake for a testimony unto them.","And the gospel needs to be preached unto all the Gentiles first.","But when they shall bring you to deliver you up
 do not premeditate beforehand what ye shall speak
 neither think ye regarding it
 but whatever shall be given you in that hour
 that speak ye
 for it is not ye that speak
 but the Holy Spirit.","Now the brother shall deliver the brother unto death
 and the father the son; and children shall rise up against their parents and shall kill them.","And ye shall be hated by everyone for my name
 but he that shall persevere unto the end
 the same shall be saved.","But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation (spoken of by Daniel the prophet) standing where it ought not
 he that reads
 let him understand
 then let those that are in Judaea flee to the mountains;","and let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house
 neither enter therein to take any thing out of his house;","and let him that is in the field not turn back again even to take up his garment.","But woe to those that are with child and to those that give suck in those days!","Pray
 therefore
 that your flight not be in winter.","For those days shall be of affliction such as never was from the beginning of the creation of the things which God created unto this time
 neither shall be.","And except that the Lord had shortened those days
 no flesh should be saved
 but for the elect\u2019s sake
 whom he has chosen
 he has shortened those days.","And then if anyone should say to you
 Behold
 here is the Christ
 or
 Behold
 he is there
 do not believe him;","for false Christs and false prophets shall rise and shall show signs and wonders to seduce
 if possible
 even the elect.","But take ye heed; behold
 I have told you everything beforehand.","But in those days after that affliction
 the sun shall darken
 and the moon shall not give her light
","and the stars shall fall from heaven
 and the powers that are in the heavens shall be shaken.","And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.","And then shall he send his angels and shall gather together his elect from the four winds
 from the uttermost part of the earth unto the uttermost part of the heaven.","Learn the similitude from the fig tree: When her branch is yet tender and puts forth leaves
 ye know that summer is near;","so ye in like manner
 when ye shall see these things come to pass
 know that it is near
 even at the doors.","Verily I say unto you that this generation shall not pass until all these things are done.","Heaven and earth shall pass away
 but my words shall not pass away.","But of that day and that hour no one knows
 no
 not even the angels who are in the heaven
 neither the Son
 but only the Father.","Take ye heed
 watch and pray; for ye know not when the time shall be.","As the man who
 taking a far journey
 left his house and gave his estate to his slaves and to each one his responsibility and commanded the porter to watch.","Watch ye therefore
 for ye know not when the Lord of the house comes: at evening or at midnight or at the cockcrowing or in the morning
","lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.","And what I say unto you
 I say unto all: Watch.","And there were some that had indignation within themselves and said
 Why was this waste of the ointment made?","But Jesus said
 Let her alone; why trouble ye her? She has wrought a good work on me.","For ye have the poor with you always
 and whenever ye will
 ye may do them good; but me ye have not always.","She has done what she could
 for she has anticipated anointing my body for the burial.","Verily I say unto you
 Wherever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world
 this also that she has done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.","And he sends forth two of his disciples and said unto them
 Go into the city
 and a man shall meet you bearing a pitcher of water; follow him.","And wherever he shall go in
 say to the husband of the house
 The Master says
 Where is the guestchamber where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?","And he will show you a large upper room furnished and prepared: there make ready for us.","And when they sat at the table and ate
 Jesus said
 Verily I say unto you
 One of you who eats with me shall betray me.","And he
 answering
 said unto them
 It is one of the twelve
 that dips with me in the dish.","The Son of man indeed goes
 as it is written of him
 but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had never been born.","And as they were eating
 Jesus took bread and
 blessing it
 broke it and gave to them and said
 Take
 eat: this is my body.","And he said unto them
 This is my blood of the new testament
 which is shed for many.","Verily I say unto you
 I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God.","Then Jesus said unto them
 All ye shall be scandalized in me this night; for it is written
 I will smite the shepherd
 and the sheep shall be scattered.","But after I have risen
 I will go before you into Galilee.","And Jesus said unto him
 Verily I say unto thee
 That this day
 even in this night
 before the cock crows twice
 thou shalt deny me three times.","And they come to the place which is named Gethsemane
 and he said to his disciples
 Sit ye here while I pray.","and said unto them
 My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death; tarry ye here
 and watch.","And he said
 Abba
 Father
 all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me; nevertheless not what I will
 but what thou wilt.","And he came and found them sleeping and said unto Peter: Simon
 sleepest thou? Could thou not watch one hour?","Watch ye and pray; enter not into temptation. The spirit truly is ready
 but the flesh is sick.","And he came the third time and said unto them
 Sleep on now and rest; it is enough
 the hour is come; behold
 the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of the sinners.","Rise up
 let us go; behold
 he that betrays me is at hand.","And Jesus
 answering
 said unto them
 Are ye come out
 as against a thief
 with swords and with staves to take me?","I was daily with you in the temple teaching
 and ye took me not
 but it is this way that the scriptures might be fulfilled.","And Jesus said unto him
 I AM
 and ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of the power of God and coming in the clouds of the heaven.","And some began to spit on him and to cover his face and to buffet him and to say unto him
 Prophesy. And the servants struck him with the palms of their hands.","And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the words that Jesus had said unto him
 Before the cock crows twice
 thou shalt deny me three times. And thinking on this
 he wept.","And Pilate asked him
 Art thou the King of the Jews? And he
 answering
 said unto him
 Thou sayest it.","And Pilate answered them
 saying
 Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?","And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice
 saying
 Eloi
 Eloi
 lama sabachthani? which is
 being interpreted
 My God
 my God
 why hast thou forsaken me?","And when the centurion
 who stood in front of him
 saw that he so cried out and expired
 he said
 Truly this man was the Son of God.","And Pilate marvelled that he was already dead; and calling unto him the centurion
 he asked him whether he was already dead.","And they said among themselves
 Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre?","But he said unto them
 Do not be frightened; Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth
 who was crucified; he is risen; he is not here; behold the place where they laid him.","And he said unto them
 Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.","He that believes and is baptized shall be saved
 but he that believes not shall be condemned.","And these signs shall follow those that believe: In my name they shall cast out demons; they shall speak with new tongues;","they shall take away serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing
 it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands upon the sick
 and they shall be healed.","The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ
 the Son of God.","and saying
 \u201cThe time is fulfilled
 and the Kingdom of God is at hand. Repent ye and believe the Gospel.\u201d","And Jesus said unto them
 \u201cCome ye after Me
 and I will make you to become fishers of men.\u201d","And Jesus rebuked him
 saying
 \u201cHold thy peace
 and come out of him!\u201d","And when they had found Him
 they said unto Him
 \u201cAll men seek for Thee.\u201d","And He said unto them
 \u201cLet us go into the next towns
 that I may preach there also; for therefore came I forth.\u201d","And Jesus
 moved with compassion
 put forth His hand and touched him
 and said unto him
 \u201cI will; be thou clean.\u201d","saying unto him
 \u201cSee that thou say nothing to any man; but go thy way
 show thyself to the priest
 and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded
 as a testimony unto them.\u201d","When Jesus saw their faith
 He said unto the one sick with the palsy
 \u201cSon
 thy sins are forgiven thee.\u201d","And immediately
 when Jesus perceived in His spirit that they so reasoned within themselves
 He said unto them
 \u201cWhy reason ye these things in your hearts:","whether it is easier to say to the sick with the palsy
 \u2018Thy sins are forgiven thee
\u2019 or to say
 \u2018Arise
 and take up thy bed and walk\u2019?","But that ye may know that the Son of Man hath power on earth to forgive sins\u2014\u201d He said to the one sick with the palsy
","\u201cI say unto thee
 arise
 and take up thy bed
 and go thy way into thine house.\u201d","And as He passed by
 He saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the custom booth
 and said unto him
 \u201cFollow Me.\u201d And he arose and followed Him.","When Jesus heard it
 He said unto them
 \u201cThey that are whole have no need of the physician
 but they that are sick. I came not to call the righteous
 but sinners to repentance.\u201d","And Jesus said unto them
 \u201cCan the attendants of the bridechamber fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them
 they cannot fast.","But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them
 and then shall they fast in those days.","\u201cNo man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment
 else the new piece that filled it up teareth away from the old
 and the rent is made worse.","And no man putteth new wine into old wineskins
 else the new wine doth burst the skins
 and the wine is spilled and the skins will be marred. But new wine must be put into new wineskins.\u201d","And the Pharisees said unto Him
 \u201cBehold
 why do they do on the Sabbath day that which is not lawful?\u201d","And He said unto them
 \u201cHave ye never read what David did when he was in need and hungered
 he and they that were with him?","And He said unto them
 \u201cThe Sabbath was made for man
 and not man for the Sabbath.","Therefore the Son of Man is Lord also of the Sabbath.\u201d","And He said unto the man who had the withered hand
 \u201cStand forth.\u201d","And He said unto them
 \u201cIs it lawful to do good on the Sabbath days
 or to do evil? To save life
 or to kill?\u201d But they held their peace.","And when He had looked round about on them with anger
 being grieved by the hardness of their hearts
 He said unto the man
 \u201cStretch forth thine hand.\u201d And he stretched it out
 and his hand was restored whole as the other.","And He called them unto Him
 and said unto them in parables
 \u201cHow can Satan cast out Satan?","And if a kingdom be divided against itself
 that kingdom cannot stand.","And if a house be divided against itself
 that house cannot stand.","And if Satan rise up against himself and be divided
 he cannot stand
 but hath an end.","No man can enter into a strong man\u2019s house and despoil his goods
 unless he will first bind the strong man; and then he will despoil his house.","\u201cVerily I say unto you
 all sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men and blasphemies
 however they shall blaspheme;","but he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness
 but is in danger of eternal damnation\u201d;","And the multitude sat about Him
 and they said unto Him
 \u201cBehold
 thy mother and thy brethren outside seek for thee.\u201d","And He answered them
 saying
 \u201cWho is My mother
 or My brethren?\u201d","And He looked round about on those who sat about Him and said
 \u201cBehold
 My mother and My brethren.","For whosoever shall do the will of God
 the same is My brother
 and My sister
 and mother.\u201d","And He taught them many things by parables
 and said unto them in His doctrine:","\u201cHearken! Behold
 there went out a sower to sow.","And it came to pass as he sowed
 some seed fell by the wayside; and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.","And some fell on stony ground where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up
 because it had no depth of earth.","But when the sun was up
 it was scorched; and because it had no root
 it withered away.","And some fell among thorns; and the thorns grew up and choked it
 and it yielded no fruit.","And other fell on good ground; and it yielded fruit that sprang up and increased and brought forth: some thirty
 and some sixty
 and some a hundredfold.\u201d","And He said unto them
 \u201cHe that hath ears to hear
 let him hear.\u201d","And He said unto them
 \u201cUnto you it is given to know the mystery of the Kingdom of God; but unto them that are without
 all these things are done in parables
","that
 \u2018seeing they may see
 and not perceive
 and hearing they may hear
 and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted and their sins should be forgiven them.\u2019\u201d","And He said unto them
 \u201cKnow you not this parable? And how then will ye know all parables?","The sower soweth the Word.","And these are they by the wayside
 where the Word is sown; but when they have heard
 Satan cometh immediately and taketh away the Word that was sown in their hearts.","And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground who
 when they have heard the Word
 immediately receive it with gladness;","but they have no root in themselves
 and so endure but for a time. Afterward
 when affliction or persecution ariseth for the Word\u2019s sake
 immediately they are offended.","And these are they which are sown among thorns
 such as hear the Word
","but the cares of this world
 and the deceitfulness of riches
 and the lusts of other things entering in
 choke the Word
 and it becometh unfruitful.","And these are they which are sown on good ground
 such as hear the Word and receive it and bring forth fruit: some thirtyfold
 some sixty
 and some a hundred.\u201d","And He said unto them
 \u201cIs a candle brought to be put under a basket or under a bed
 and not to be set on a candlestick?","For there is nothing hid
 which shall not be manifested; neither was anything kept secret
 but that it should be revealed.","If any man have ears to hear
 let him hear.\u201d","And He said unto them
 \u201cTake heed what ye hear. With what measure ye mete it shall be measured to you; and unto you that hear shall more be given.","For he that hath
 to him shall be given; and he that hath not
 from him shall be taken even that which he hath.\u201d","And He said
 \u201cSo is the Kingdom of God as if a man should cast seed into the ground
","and should sleep
 and rise night and day
 and the seed should spring up and grow
 he knoweth not how.","For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself: first the blade
 then the ear
 after that the full corn in the ear.","But when the fruit is brought forth
 immediately he putteth in the sickle
 because the harvest is come.\u201d","And He said
 \u201cTo what shall we liken the Kingdom of God? Or with what comparison shall we compare it?","It is like a grain of mustard seed which
 when it is sown in the earth
 is less than all the seeds that are in the earth.","But when it is sown
 it groweth up and becometh greater than all herbs
 and shooteth out great branches
 so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.\u201d","And that same day
 when the evening had come
 He said unto them
 \u201cLet us pass over unto the other side.\u201d","And He arose
 and rebuked the wind and said unto the sea
 \u201cPeace
 be still.\u201d And the wind ceased
 and there was a great calm.","And He said unto them
 \u201cWhy are you so fearful? How is it that ye have no faith?\u201d","For He had said unto him
 \u201cCome out of the man
 thou unclean spirit.\u201d","And Jesus asked him
 \u201cWhat is thy name?\u201d And he answered
 saying
 \u201cMy name is Legion
 for we are many.\u201d","But Jesus suffered him not
 and said unto him
 \u201cGo home to thy friends
 and tell them what great things the Lord hath done for thee
 and how He hath had compassion on thee.\u201d","for she said
 \u201cIf I may touch but His clothes
 I shall be whole.\u201d","And His disciples said unto Him
 \u201cThou seest the multitude thronging Thee
 and sayest Thou
 \u2018Who touched Me?\u2019\u201d","And He said unto her
 \u201cDaughter
 thy faith hath made thee whole. Go in peace
 and be whole of thy plague.\u201d","As soon as Jesus heard the word that had been spoken
 He said unto the ruler of the synagogue
 \u201cBe not afraid; only believe.\u201d","And when He had come in
 He said unto them
 \u201cWhy make ye this ado and weep? The damsel is not dead
 but sleepeth.\u201d","And He took the damsel by the hand and said unto her
 \u201cTalitha cumi
\u201d which is
 being interpreted
 \u201cDamsel
 I say unto thee
 arise.\u201d","But Jesus said unto them
 \u201cA prophet is not without honor
 save in his own country
 and among his own kin
 and in his own house.\u201d","And He called unto Him the twelve
 and began to send them forth two by two
 and gave them power over unclean spirits
","And He said unto them
 \u201cIn whatever place ye enter into a house
 there abide until ye depart from that place.","And whosoever shall not receive you nor hear you
 when ye depart thence
 shake off the dust under your feet as a testimony against them. Verily I say unto you
 it shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the Day of Judgment than for that city.\u201d","But when Herod heard of it
 he said
 \u201cIt is John
 whom I beheaded; he is risen from the dead.\u201d","and when the daughter of the said Herodias came in and danced
 and pleased Herod and those who sat with him
 the king said unto the damsel
 \u201cAsk of me whatsoever thou wilt
 and I will give it to thee.\u201d","And she went forth and said unto her mother
 \u201cWhat shall I ask?\u201d And Herodias said
 \u201cThe head of John the Baptist.\u201d","And He said unto them
 \u201cCome ye yourselves apart into a desert place
 and rest a while.\u201d For there were many coming and going
 and they had no leisure
 even so much as to eat.","He answered and said unto them
 \u201cGive ye them to eat.\u201d And they said to Him
 \u201cShall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread and give them to eat?\u201d","He said unto them
 \u201cHow many loaves have ye? Go and see.\u201d And when they knew
 they said
 \u201cFive
 and two fishes.\u201d","for they all saw Him and were troubled. And immediately He talked with them
 and said unto them
 \u201cBe of good cheer! It is I; be not afraid.\u201d","He answered and said unto them
 \u201cWell hath Isaiah prophesied of you hypocrites
 as it is written: \u2018This people honoreth Me with their lips
 but their heart is far from Me.","Therefore
 in vain do they worship Me
 teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.\u2019","For laying aside the commandment of God
 ye hold to the tradition of men
 as the washing of pots and cups
 and many other like things ye do.\u201d","And He said unto them
 \u201cFull well ye reject the commandment of God
 that ye may keep your own tradition.","For Moses said
 \u2018Honor thy father and thy mother
\u2019 and
 \u2018Whoso curseth father or mother
 let him die the death.\u2019","But ye say that if a man shall say to his father or mother
 \u2018It is Corban\u2019 (that is to say
 a gift of whatsoever thou mightest have profited from me)
 he shall be freed;","and ye suffer him no more to do aught for his father or his mother
","thus making the Word of God of no effect through your tradition
 which ye have delivered. And many like things do ye.\u201d","And when He had called all the people unto Him
 He said unto them
 \u201cHearken unto Me every one of you
 and understand:","There is nothing from outside a man that
 entering into him
 can defile him; but the things which come out of him
 those are they that defile the man.","And He said unto them
 \u201cAre ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive that whatsoever thing from outside entereth into a man
 it cannot defile him
","because it entereth not into his heart
 but into the belly and goeth out into the drain
 thereby purging all meats?\u201d","And He said
 \u201cThat which cometh out of the man
 that defileth the man.","For from within
 out of the heart of men
 proceed evil thoughts
 adulteries
 fornications
 murders
","thefts
 covetousness
 wickedness
 deceit
 lasciviousness
 an evil eye
 blasphemy
 pride
 foolishness:","all these evil things come from within and defile the man.\u201d","But Jesus said unto her
 \u201cLet the children first be filled
 for it is not meet to take the children\u2019s bread and to cast it unto the dogs.\u201d","And He said unto her
 \u201cFor this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter.\u201d","And looking up to Heaven
 He sighed and said unto him
 \u201cEphphatha
\u201d that is
 \u201cBe opened.\u201d","In those days
 the multitude being very great and having nothing to eat
 Jesus called His disciples unto Him and said unto them
","\u201cI have compassion on the multitude
 because they have now been with Me three days and have nothing to eat.","And if I send them away fasting to their own houses
 they will faint by the way; for divers of them came from afar.\u201d","And He asked them
 \u201cHow many loaves have ye?\u201d And they said
 \u201cSeven.\u201d","And He sighed deeply in His spirit and said
 \u201cWhy doth this generation seek after a sign? Verily I say unto you
 there shall no sign be given unto this generation.\u201d","And He charged them
 saying
 \u201cTake heed
 beware of the leaven of the Pharisees
 and of the leaven of Herod.\u201d","And when Jesus knew it
 He said unto them
 \u201cWhy reason ye
 because ye have no bread? Do ye not yet perceive
 nor understand? Have ye your heart yet hardened?","Having eyes
 see ye not? And having ears
 hear ye not? And do ye not remember?","When I broke the five loaves among five thousand
 how many baskets full of fragments took ye up?\u201d They said unto Him
 \u201cTwelve.\u201d","\u201cAnd when the seven among four thousand
 how many baskets full of fragments took ye up?\u201d And they said
 \u201cSeven.\u201d","And He said unto them
 \u201cHow is it that ye do not understand?\u201d","And He took the blind man by the hand
 and led him out of the town. And when He had spit on his eyes and put His hands upon him
 He asked him if he saw anything.","And He sent him away to his house
 saying
 \u201cNeither go into the town
 nor tell it to any in the town.\u201d","And Jesus went out with His disciples into the towns of Caesarea Philippi; and on the way He asked His disciples
 saying unto them
 \u201cWho do men say that I am?\u201d","And He said unto them
 \u201cBut whom say ye that I am?\u201d And Peter answered and said unto Him
 \u201cThou art the Christ.\u201d","But when He had turned about and looked on His disciples
 He rebuked Peter
 saying
 \u201cGet thee behind Me
 Satan; for thou savorest not the things that are of God
 but the things that are of men.\u201d","And when He had called the people unto Him with His disciples also
 He said unto them
 \u201cWhosoever will come after Me
 let him deny himself
 and take up his cross
 and follow Me.","For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for My sake and the Gospel\u2019s
 the same shall save it.","For what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world
 and lose his own soul?","Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?","Whosoever
 therefore
 shall be ashamed of Me and of My words in this adulterous and sinful generation
 of him also shall the Son of Man be ashamed when He cometh in the glory of His Father with the holy angels.\u201d","And He said unto them
 \u201cVerily I say unto you
 that there are some of them that stand here who shall not taste of death till they have seen the Kingdom of God come with power.\u201d","And Peter spoke and said to Jesus
 \u201cMaster
 it is good for us to be here. Let us make three tabernacles: one for Thee
 one for Moses
 and one for Elijah\u2014\u201d","And He answered and told them
 \u201cElijah verily cometh first and restoreth all things
 and how it is written of the Son of Man that He must suffer many things and be set at nought.","But I say unto you that Elijah has indeed come
 and they have done unto him whatsoever they pleased
 as it is written of him.\u201d","And He asked the scribes
 \u201cWhat question ye with them?\u201d","Jesus answered him and said
 \u201cO faithless generation
 how long shall I be with you? How long shall I suffer you? Bring him unto Me.\u201d","And He asked his father
 \u201cHow long is it ago since this came unto him?\u201d And he said
 \u201cFrom childhood.","Jesus said unto him
 \u201cIf thou canst believe
 all things are possible to him that believeth.\u201d","When Jesus saw that the people came running together
 He rebuked the foul spirit
 saying unto him
 \u201cThou dumb and deaf spirit
 I charge thee
 come out of him and enter no more into him.\u201d","And He said unto them
 \u201cThis kind can come forth by nothing but by prayer and fasting.\u201d","For He taught His disciples and said unto them
 \u201cThe Son of Man is delivered into the hands of men
 and they shall kill Him; and after He is killed
 He shall rise the third day.\u201d","And He came to Capernaum; and being in the house
 He asked them
 \u201cWhat was it that ye disputed among yourselves on the way?\u201d","And He sat down
 and called the twelve and said unto them
 \u201cIf any man desire to be first
 the same shall be last of all and servant of all.\u201d","And He took a child and set him in the midst of them. And when He had taken him in His arms
 He said unto them
","But Jesus said
 \u201cForbid him not
 for there is no man who shall do a miracle in My name that can lightly speak evil of Me.","For he that is not against us is on our side.","For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in My name
 because ye belong to Christ
 verily I say unto you
 he shall not lose his reward.","And whosoever shall cause one of these little ones that believe in Me to fall
 it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and he were cast into the sea.","And if thy hand cause thee to fall
 cut it off. It is better for thee to enter into life maimed than
 having two hands
 to go into hell
 into the fire that never shall be quenched
","And if thy foot cause thee to fall
 cut it off. It is better for thee to enter halt into life than
 having two feet
 to be cast into hell
 into the fire that never shall be quenched
","And if thine eye cause thee to fall
 pluck it out. It is better for thee to enter into the Kingdom of God with one eye than
 having two eyes
 to be cast into hell fire
","where \u2018their worm dieth not
 and the fire is not quenched.\u2019","For every one shall be salted with fire
 and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.","Salt is good
 but if the salt has lost his saltness
 with what will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves
 and have peace one with another.\u201d","And He answered and said unto them
 \u201cWhat did Moses command you?\u201d","And Jesus answered and said unto them
 \u201cBecause of the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept.","But from the beginning of the creation
 \u2019God made them male and female.","For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother
 and cleave to his wife
","and the two shall be one flesh.\u2019 So then they are no more two
 but one flesh.","What therefore God hath joined together
 let not man put asunder.\u201d","And He said unto them
 \u201cWhosoever shall put away his wife and marry another
 committeth adultery against her.","And if a woman shall put away her husband and be married to another
 she committeth adultery.\u201d","But when Jesus saw it
 He was much displeased and said unto them
 \u201cSuffer the little children to come unto Me
 and forbid them not
 for of such is the Kingdom of God.","Verily I say unto you
 whosoever shall not receive the Kingdom of God as a little child
 he shall not enter therein.\u201d","And Jesus said unto him
 \u201cWhy callest thou Me good? There is none good but One
 that is
 God.","Thou knowest the commandments: \u2018Do not commit adultery
 do not kill
 do not steal
 do not bear false witness
 defraud not
 honor thy father and mother.\u2019\u201d","And he answered and said unto Him
 \u201cMaster
 all these have I observed from my youth.\u201d","Then Jesus
 beholding him
 loved him and said unto him
 \u201cOne thing thou lackest: Go thy way
 sell whatsoever thou hast and give to the poor
 and thou shalt have treasure in Heaven; and come
 take up the cross
 and follow Me.\u201d","And Jesus looked round about and said unto His disciples
 \u201cHow hardly shall they that have riches enter into the Kingdom of God!\u201d","And the disciples were astonished at His words
 but Jesus answered again and said unto them
 \u201cChildren
 how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the Kingdom of God!","It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle
 than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God.\u201d","And they were astonished beyond measure
 saying among themselves
 \u201cWho then can be saved?\u201d","And Jesus
 looking upon them
 said
 \u201cWith men it is impossible

 \u201cVerily I say unto you
 there is no man that hath left house or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for My sake and the Gospel\u2019s
","but he shall receive a hundredfold now in this time

 and the last first.\u201d","saying
 \u201cBehold

 \u201cWhat would ye that I should do for you?\u201d","But Jesus said unto them
 \u201cYe know not what ye ask. Can ye drink of the cup that I drink of
 and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?\u201d","And they said unto Him
 \u201cWe can.\u201d And Jesus said unto them
 \u201cYe shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized with
 also shall ye be baptized.","But to sit on My right hand and on My left hand is not Mine to give
 but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared.\u201d","But Jesus called them to Him and said unto them
 \u201cYe know that they that are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them

 \u201cGo thy way. Thy faith hath made thee whole.\u201d And immediately he received his sight
 and followed Jesus in the way.","and said unto them

 said unto them
 \u201cHave faith in God.","For verily I say unto you

 what things so ever ye desire when ye pray
 believe that ye receive them
 and ye shall have them.","And when ye stand praying
 forgive if ye have aught against any

 \u201cI will also ask of you one question; answer Me
 and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.","The baptism of John: was it from Heaven

 said unto them
 \u201cNeither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.\u201d","And He began to speak unto them by parables: \u201cA certain man planted a vineyard
 and set a hedge about it

 that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.","And they caught him
 and beat him
 and sent him away empty.","And again he sent unto them another servant

 and wounded him in the head

 beating some and killing some.","Having yet therefore one son
 his wellbeloved

 \u2018They will reverence my son.\u2019","But those husbandmen said among themselves
 \u2018This is the heir. Come
 let us kill him
 and the inheritance shall be ours.\u2019","And they took him and killed him
 and cast him out of the vineyard.","What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the husbandmen
 and will give the vineyard unto others.","And have ye not read this Scripture? \u2018The stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner;","this was the Lord\u2019s doing

 said unto them
 \u201cRender to Caesar the things that are Caesar\u2019s
 and to God the things that are God\u2019s.\u201d And they marveled at Him.","And Jesus answering
 said unto them
 \u201cDo ye not therefore err
 because ye know not the Scriptures
 neither the power of God?","For when they shall rise from the dead
 they neither marry nor are given in marriage
 but are as the angels who are in Heaven.","And concerning the dead
 that they rise: have ye not read in the book of Moses
 how in the bush God spoke unto him
 saying
 \u2018I am the God of Abraham
 and the God of Isaac
 and the God of Jacob\u2019?","He is not the God of the dead
 but the God of the living. Ye therefore do greatly err.\u201d","And one of the scribes came
 and having heard them reasoning together
 and perceiving that He had answered them well
 asked Him
 \u201cWhich is the first commandment of all?\u201d","And Jesus answered him
 \u201cThe first of all the commandments is: \u2018Hear
 O Israel
 the Lord our God is one Lord.","And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart
 and with all thy soul
 and with all thy mind
 and with all thy strength;\u2019 this is the first commandment.","And the second is like
 namely this: \u2018Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.\u2019 There is no other commandment greater than these.\u201d","And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly
 He said unto him
 \u201cThou art not far from the Kingdom of God.\u201d And no man after that dared ask Him any question.","And Jesus answered and said
 while He taught in the temple
 \u201cHow say the scribes that Christ is the Son of David?","For David himself said by the Holy Ghost: \u2018The Lord said to my Lord
 \u201cSit Thou at My right hand until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool.\u201d\u2019","David therefore himself calleth Him \u2018Lord\u2019; and whence is He then his son?\u201d And the common people heard Him gladly.","And He said unto them in His doctrine
 \u201cBeware of the scribes
 who love to go in long clothing
 and love salutations in the marketplaces
","and the chief seats in the synagogues
 and the uppermost rooms at feasts
","who devour widows\u2019 houses
 and for a pretense make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation.\u201d","And He called unto Him His disciples and said unto them
 \u201cVerily I say unto you
 that this poor widow hath cast more in than all they that have cast into the treasury;","for they all cast in of their abundance
 but she of her want cast in all that she had
 even all her living.\u201d","And as He went out of the temple
 one of His disciples said unto Him
 \u201cMaster
 see what manner of stones and what buildings are here!\u201d","And Jesus answering
 said unto him
 \u201cSeest thou these great buildings? There shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down.\u201d","And Jesus answering them
 began to say
 \u201cTake heed lest any man deceive you.","For many shall come in My name
 saying
 \u2018I am Christ!\u2019 and shall deceive many.","And when ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars
 be ye not troubled
 for such things must come to pass; but the end shall not be yet.","For nation shall rise against nation
 and kingdom against kingdom; and there shall be earthquakes in divers places
 and there shall be famines and troubles. These are the beginnings of sorrows.","\u201cBut take heed for yourselves
 for they shall deliver you up to councils
 and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten. And ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for My sake
 for a testimony against them.","And the Gospel must first be proclaimed among all nations.","But when then shall lead you and deliver you up
 take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak; neither need ye premeditate. But whatsoever shall be given you in that hour
 that speak ye; for it is not ye that speak
 but the Holy Ghost.","Now the brother shall betray the brother to death
 and the father the son; and children shall rise up against their parents and shall cause them to be put to death.","And ye shall be hated by all men for My name\u2019s sake; but he that shall endure unto the end
 the same shall be saved.","\u201cBut when ye shall see the abomination of desolation
 spoken of by Daniel the prophet
 standing where it ought not be\u201d (let him that readeth understand)
 \u201cthen let them that be in Judea flee to the mountains.","And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house
 neither enter therein to take any thing out of his house.","And let him that is in the field not turn back again to take up his garment.","But woe to them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days!","And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter.","For in those days shall be affliction such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created until this time
 neither shall be.","And except that the Lord had shortened those days
 no flesh should be saved; but for the elect\u2019s sake
 whom He hath chosen
 He hath shortened the days.","And then if any man shall say to you
 \u2018Lo
 here is Christ!\u2019 or
 \u2018Lo
 He is there!\u2019 believe him not;","for false christs and false prophets shall rise
 and shall show signs and wonders to seduce
 if it were possible
 even the elect.","But take ye heed; behold
 I have foretold you all things.","\u201cBut in those days
 after that tribulation
 \u2018the sun shall be darkened
 and the moon shall not give her light
","and the stars of heaven shall fall
 and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken.\u2019","And then shall they see the Son of Man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.","And then shall He send His angels and shall gather together His elect from the four winds
 from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven.","\u201cNow learn a parable of the fig tree: When her branch is yet tender and putteth forth leaves
 ye know that summer is near.","So ye in like manner
 when ye shall see these things come to pass
 know that it is nigh
 even at the doors.","Verily I say unto you
 that this generation shall not pass till all these things be done.","Heaven and earth shall pass away
 but My words shall not pass away.","But of that day and that hour knoweth no man \u2014 no
 not the angels who are in Heaven
 neither the Son
 but only the Father.","\u201cTake ye heed
 watch and pray; for ye know not when the time is.","For the Son of Man is as a man taking a far journey
 who left his house and gave authority to his servants
 and to every man his work
 and commanded the doorkeeper to watch.","Watch ye therefore
 for ye know not when the Master of the house cometh \u2014 at evening
 or at midnight
 or at the cockcrowing
 or in the morning \u2014","lest coming suddenly
 He find you sleeping.","And what I say unto you
 I say unto all: Watch!\u201d","And there were some who were indignant within themselves and said
 \u201cWhy was this ointment wasted?","And Jesus said
 \u201cLet her alone. Why trouble ye her? She hath wrought a good work on Me.","For ye have the poor with you always
 and whensoever ye will
 ye may do them good; but Me ye have not always.","She hath done what she could; she hath come beforehand to anoint My body for burial.","Verily I say unto you
 wheresoever this Gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world
 this also that she hath done shall be spoken of as a memorial of her.\u201d","And He sent forth two of His disciples and said unto them
 \u201cGo ye into the city
 and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water; follow him.","And wheresoever he shall go in
 say ye to the master of the house
 \u2018The Master saith
 \u201cWhere is the guestchamber where I shall eat the Passover with My disciples?\u201d\u2019","And he will show you a large upper room furnished and prepared; there make ready for us.\u201d","And as they sat and ate
 Jesus said
 \u201cVerily I say unto you
 one of you who eateth with Me shall betray Me.\u201d","And He answered and said unto them
 \u201cIt is one of the twelve that dippeth with Me in the dish.","The Son of Man indeed goeth
 as it is written of Him; but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! Good were it for that man if he had never been born.\u201d","And as they ate
 Jesus took bread
 and blessed and broke it
 and gave it to them and said
 \u201cTake
 eat; this is My body.\u201d","And He said unto them
 \u201cThis is My blood of the new testament
 which is shed for many.","Verily I say unto you
 I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine
 until that day that I drink it new in the Kingdom of God.\u201d","And Jesus said unto them
 \u201cAll ye shall be offended because of Me this night
 for it is written: \u2018I will smite the Shepherd
 and the sheep shall be scattered.\u2019","But after I am risen
 I will go before you into Galilee.\u201d","And Jesus said unto him
 \u201cVerily I say unto thee that this day
 even in this night
 before the cock crows twice
 thou shalt deny Me thrice.\u201d","And they came to a place which is named Gethsemane; and He said to His disciples
 \u201cSit ye here while I shall pray.\u201d","And He said unto them
 \u201cMy soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death; tarry ye here
 and watch.\u201d","And He said
 \u201cAbba
 Father
 all things are possible unto Thee. Take away this cup from Me; nevertheless not what I will
 but what Thou wilt.\u201d","And He came back and found them sleeping
 and said unto Peter
 \u201cSimon
 sleepest thou? Couldest thou not watch one hour?","Watch ye and pray
 lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready
 but the flesh is weak.\u201d","And He came the third time and said unto them
 \u201cSleep on now and take your rest. It is enough: the hour is come; behold
 the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.","Rise up; let us go. Lo
 he that betrayeth Me is at hand.\u201d","And Jesus answered and said unto them
 \u201cHave ye come out
 as against a thief
 with swords and with staves to take Me?","I was daily with you in the temple teaching
 and ye took Me not. But the Scriptures must be fulfilled.\u201d","And Jesus said
 \u201cI am; and ye shall see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power
 and coming in the clouds of heaven.\u201d","And some began to spit on Him
 and to cover His face
 and to buffet Him
 and to say unto Him
 \u201cProphesy!\u201d And the servants struck Him with the palms of their hands.","And the second time the cock crowed. And Peter called to mind the words that Jesus had said unto him: \u201cBefore the cock crows twice
 thou shalt deny Me thrice.\u201d And when he thought thereon
 he wept.","And Pilate asked Him
 \u201cArt thou the King of the Jews?\u201d And answering He said unto him
 \u201cThou sayest it.\u201d","But Pilate answered them
 saying
 \u201cWill ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?\u201d","And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice
 saying
 \u201cEloi
 Eloi
 lama sabachthani?\u201d which is
 being interpreted
 \u201cMy God
 My God
 why hast Thou forsaken Me?\u201d","And when the centurion who stood opposite Him saw that He so cried out and gave up the ghost
 he said
 \u201cTruly
 this Man was the Son of God!\u201d","And Pilate wondered if He were already dead; and calling unto him the centurion
 he asked him whether He had been any while dead.","And they said among themselves
 \u201cWho shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulcher?\u201d","And he said unto them
 \u201cBe not afraid. Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth
 who was crucified. He is risen! He is not here. Behold the place where they laid Him.","And He said unto them
 \u201cGo ye into all the world
 and preach the Gospel to every creature.","He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.","And these signs shall follow them that believe: In My name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;","they shall take up serpents
 and if they drink any deadly thing
 it shall not hurt them. They shall lay hands on the sick
 and they shall recover.\u201d","The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ
 the Son of God;","And saying
 The time is fulfilled
 and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye
 and believe the gospel.","And Jesus said unto them
 Come ye after me
 and I will make you to become fishers of men.","And Jesus rebuked him
 saying
 Hold thy peace
 and come out of him.","And when they had found him
 they said unto him
 All men seek for thee.","And he said unto them
 Let us go into the next towns
 that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.","And Jesus
 moved with compassion
 put forth his hand
 and touched him
 and saith unto him
 I will; be thou clean.","And saith unto him
 See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way
 shew thyself to the priest
 and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded
 for a testimony unto them.","When Jesus saw their faith
 he said unto the sick of the palsy
 Son
 thy sins be forgiven thee.","And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves
 he said unto them
 Why reason ye these things in your hearts?","Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy
 Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say
 Arise
 and take up thy bed
 and walk?","But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins
 (he saith to the sick of the palsy
)","I say unto thee
 Arise
 and take up thy bed
 and go thy way into thine house.","And as he passed by
 he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom
 and said unto him
 Follow me. And he arose and followed him.","When Jesus heard it
 he saith unto them
 They that are whole have no need of the physician
 but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous
 but sinners to repentance.","And Jesus said unto them
 Can the children of the bridechamber fast
 while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them
 they cannot fast.","But the days will come
 when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them
 and then shall they fast in those days.","No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old
 and the rent is made worse.","And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: else the new wine doth burst the bottles
 and the wine is spilled
 and the bottles will be marred: but new wine must be put into new bottles.","And the Pharisees said unto him
 Behold
 why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful?","And he said unto them
 Have ye never read what David did
 when he had need
 and was an hungred
 he
 and they that were with him?","And he said unto them
 The sabbath was made for man
 and not man for the sabbath:","Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.","And he saith unto the man which had the withered hand
 Stand forth.","And he saith unto them
 Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days
 or to do evil? to save life
 or to kill? But they held their peace.","And when he had looked round about on them with anger
 being grieved for the hardness of their hearts
 he saith unto the man
 Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it out: and his hand was restored whole as the other.","And he called them unto him
 and said unto them in parables
 How can Satan cast out Satan?","And if a kingdom be divided against itself
 that kingdom cannot stand.","And if a house be divided against itself
 that house cannot stand.","And if Satan rise up against himself
 and be divided
 he cannot stand
 but hath an end.","No man can enter into a strong man's house
 and spoil his goods
 except he will first bind the strong man; and then he will spoil his house.","Verily I say unto you
 All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men
 and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme:","But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness
 but is in danger of eternal damnation.","And the multitude sat about him
 and they said unto him
 Behold
 thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee.","And he answered them
 saying
 Who is my mother
 or my brethren?","And he looked round about on them which sat about him
 and said
 Behold my mother and my brethren!","For whosoever shall do the will of God
 the same is my brother
 and my sister
 and mother.","And he taught them many things by parables
 and said unto them in his doctrine
","Hearken; Behold
 there went out a sower to sow:","And it came to pass
 as he sowed
 some fell by the way side
 and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.","And some fell on stony ground
 where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up
 because it had no depth of earth:","But when the sun was up
 it was scorched; and because it had no root
 it withered away.","And some fell among thorns
 and the thorns grew up
 and choked it
 and it yielded no fruit.","And other fell on good ground
 and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth
 some thirty
 and some sixty
 and some an hundred.","And he said unto them
 He that hath ears to hear
 let him hear.","And he said unto them
 Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without
 all these things are done in parables:","That seeing they may see
 and not perceive; and hearing they may hear
 and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted
 and their sins should be forgiven them.","And he said unto them
 Know ye not this parable? and how then will ye know all parables?","The sower soweth the word.","And these are they by the way side
 where the word is sown; but when they have heard
 Satan cometh immediately
 and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts.","And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who
 when they have heard the word
 immediately receive it with gladness;","And have no root in themselves
 and so endure but for a time: afterward
 when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake
 immediately they are offended.","And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word
","And the cares of this world
 and the deceitfulness of riches
 and the lusts of other things entering in
 choke the word
 and it becometh unfruitful.","And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word
 and receive it
 and bring forth fruit
 some thirtyfold
 some sixty
 and some an hundred.","And he said unto them
 Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel
 or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?","For there is nothing hid
 which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret
 but that it should come abroad.","If any man have ears to hear
 let him hear.","And he said unto them
 Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete
 it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given.","For he that hath
 to him shall be given: and he that hath not
 from him shall be taken even that which he hath.","And he said
 So is the kingdom of God
 as if a man should cast seed into the ground;","And should sleep
 and rise night and day
 and the seed should spring and grow up
 he knoweth not how.","For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade
 then the ear
 after that the full corn in the ear.","But when the fruit is brought forth
 immediately he putteth in the sickle
 because the harvest is come.","And he said
 Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?","It is like a grain of mustard seed
 which
 when it is sown in the earth
 is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:","But when it is sown
 it groweth up
 and becometh greater than all herbs
 and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.","And the same day
 when the even was come
 he saith unto them
 Let us pass over unto the other side.","And he arose
 and rebuked the wind
 and said unto the sea
 Peace
 be still. And the wind ceased
 and there was a great calm.","And he said unto them
 Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?","For he said unto him
 Come out of the man
 thou unclean spirit.","And he asked him
 What is thy name? And he answered
 saying
 My name is Legion: for we are many.","Howbeit Jesus suffered him not
 but saith unto him
 Go home to thy friends
 and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee
 and hath had compassion on thee.","For she said
 If I may touch but his clothes
 I shall be whole.","And his disciples said unto him
 Thou seest the multitude thronging thee
 and sayest thou
 Who touched me?","And he said unto her
 Daughter
 thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace
 and be whole of thy plague.","As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken
 he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue
 Be not afraid
 only believe.","And when he was come in
 he saith unto them
 Why make ye this ado
 and weep? the damsel is not dead
 but sleepeth.","And he took the damsel by the hand
 and said unto her
 Talitha cumi; which is
 being interpreted
 Damsel
 I say unto thee
 arise.","But Jesus
 said unto them
 A prophet is not without honour
 but in his own country
 and among his own kin
 and in his own house.","And he called unto him the twelve
 and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits;","And he said unto them
 In what place soever ye enter into an house
 there abide till ye depart from that place.","And whosoever shall not receive you
 nor hear you
 when ye depart thence
 shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them. Verily I say unto you
 It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment
 than for that city.","But when Herod heard thereof
 he said
 It is John
 whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead.","And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in
 and danced
 and pleased Herod and them that sat with him
 the king said unto the damsel
 Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt
 and I will give it thee.","And she went forth
 and said unto her mother
 What shall I ask? And she said
 The head of John the Baptist.","And he said unto them
 Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place
 and rest a while: for there were many coming and going
 and they had no leisure so much as to eat.","He answered and said unto them
 Give ye them to eat. And they say unto him
 Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread
 and give them to eat?","He saith unto them
 How many loaves have ye? go and see. And when they knew
 they say
 Five
 and two fishes.","For they all saw him
 and were troubled. And immediately he talked with them
 and saith unto them
 Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid.","He answered and said unto them
 Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites
 as it is written
 This people honoureth me with their lips
 but their heart is far from me.","Howbeit in vain do they worship me
 teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.","For laying aside the commandment of God
 ye hold the tradition of men
 as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do.","And he said unto them
 Full well ye reject the commandment of God
 that ye may keep your own tradition.","For Moses said
 Honour thy father and thy mother; and
 Whoso curseth father or mother
 let him die the death:","But ye say
 If a man shall say to his father or mother
 It is Corban
 that is to say
 a gift
 by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; he shall be free.","And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother;","Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition
 which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye.","And when he had called all the people unto him
 he said unto them
 Hearken unto me every one of you
 and understand:","There is nothing from without a man
 that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him
 those are they that defile the man.","And he saith unto them
 Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive
 that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man
 it cannot defile him;","Because it entereth not into his heart
 but into the belly
 and goeth out into the draught
 purging all meats?","And he said
 That which cometh out of the man
 that defileth the man.","For from within
 out of the heart of men
 proceed evil thoughts
 adulteries
 fornications
 murders
","Thefts
 covetousness
 wickedness
 deceit
 lasciviousness
 an evil eye
 blasphemy
 pride
 foolishness:","All these evil things come from within
 and defile the man.","But Jesus said unto her
 Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children's bread
 and to cast it unto the dogs.","And he said unto her
 For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter.","And looking up to heaven
 he sighed
 and saith unto him
 Ephphatha
 that is
 Be opened.","In those days the multitude being very great
 and having nothing to eat
 Jesus called his disciples unto him
 and saith unto them
","I have compassion on the multitude
 because they have now been with me three days
 and have nothing to eat:","And if I send them away fasting to their own houses
 they will faint by the way: for divers of them came from far.","And he asked them
 How many loaves have ye? And they said
 Seven.","And he sighed deeply in his spirit
 and saith
 Why doth this generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you
 There shall no sign be given unto this generation.","And he charged them
 saying
 Take heed
 beware of the leaven of the Pharisees
 and of the leaven of Herod.","And when Jesus knew it
 he saith unto them
 Why reason ye
 because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet
 neither understand? have ye your heart yet hardened?","Having eyes
 see ye not? and having ears
 hear ye not? and do ye not remember?","When I brake the five loaves among five thousand
 how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say unto him
 Twelve.","And when the seven among four thousand
 how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? And they said
 Seven.","And he said unto them
 How is it that ye do not understand?","And he took the blind man by the hand
 and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes
 and put his hands upon him
 he asked him if he saw ought.","And he sent him away to his house
 saying
 Neither go into the town
 nor tell it to any in the town.","And Jesus went out
 and his disciples
 into the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples
 saying unto them
 Whom do men say that I am?","And he saith unto them
 But whom say ye that I am? And Peter answereth and saith unto him
 Thou art the Christ.","But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples
 he rebuked Peter
 saying
 Get thee behind me
 Satan: for thou savourest not the things that be of God
 but the things that be of men.","And when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also
 he said unto them
 Whosoever will come after me
 let him deny himself
 and take up his cross
 and follow me.","For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's
 the same shall save it.","For what shall it profit a man
 if he shall gain the whole world
 and lose his own soul?","Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?","Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed
 when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.","And he said unto them
 Verily I say unto you
 That there be some of them that stand here
 which shall not taste of death
 till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power.","And Peter answered and said to Jesus
 Master
 it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee
 and one for Moses
 and one for Elias.","And he answered and told them
 Elias verily cometh first
 and restoreth all things; and how it is written of the Son of man
 that he must suffer many things
 and be set at nought.","But I say unto you
 That Elias is indeed come
 and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed
 as it is written of him.","And he asked the scribes
 What question ye with them?","He answereth him
 and saith
 O faithless generation
 how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him unto me.","And he asked his father
 How long is it ago since this came unto him? And he said
 Of a child.","Jesus said unto him
 If thou canst believe
 all things are possible to him that believeth.","When Jesus saw that the people came running together
 he rebuked the foul spirit
 saying unto him
 Thou dumb and deaf spirit
 I charge thee
 come out of him
 and enter no more into him.","And he said unto them
 This kind can come forth by nothing
 but by prayer and fasting.","For he taught his disciples
 and said unto them
 The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men
 and they shall kill him; and after that he is killed
 he shall rise the third day.","And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked them
 What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way?","And he sat down
 and called the twelve
 and saith unto them
 If any man desire to be first
 the same shall be last of all
 and servant of all.","And he took a child
 and set him in the midst of them: and when he had taken him in his arms
 he said unto them
","But Jesus said
 Forbid him not: for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name
 that can lightly speak evil of me.","For he that is not against us is on our part.","For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name
 because ye belong to Christ
 verily I say unto you
 he shall not lose his reward.","And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me
 it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck
 and he were cast into the sea.","And if thy hand offend thee
 cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed
 than having two hands to go into hell
 into the fire that never shall be quenched:","And if thy foot offend thee
 cut it off: it is better for thee to enter halt into life
 than having two feet to be cast into hell
 into the fire that never shall be quenched:","And if thine eye offend thee
 pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye
 than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire:","Where their worm dieth not
 and the fire is not quenched.","For every one shall be salted with fire
 and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.","Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his saltness
 wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves
 and have peace one with another.","And he answered and said unto them
 What did Moses command you?","And Jesus answered and said unto them
 For the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept.","But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female.","For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother
 and cleave to his wife;","And they twain shall be one flesh: so then they are no more twain
 but one flesh.","What therefore God hath joined together
 let not man put asunder.","And he saith unto them
 Whosoever shall put away his wife
 and marry another
 committeth adultery against her.","And if a woman shall put away her husband
 and be married to another
 she committeth adultery.","But when Jesus saw it
 he was much displeased
 and said unto them
 Suffer the little children to come unto me
 and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.","Verily I say unto you
 Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child
 he shall not enter therein.","And Jesus said unto him
 Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one
 that is
 God.","Thou knowest the commandments
 Do not commit adultery
 Do not kill
 Do not steal
 Do not bear false witness
 Defraud not
 Honour thy father and mother.","And he answered and said unto him
 Master
 all these have I observed from my youth.","Then Jesus beholding him loved him
 and said unto him
 One thing thou lackest: go thy way
 sell whatsoever thou hast
 and give to the poor
 and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come
 take up the cross
 and follow me.","And Jesus looked round about
 and saith unto his disciples
 How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!","And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus answereth again
 and saith unto them
 Children
 how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!","It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle
 than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.","And they were astonished out of measure
 saying among themselves
 Who then can be saved?","And Jesus looking upon them saith
 With men it is impossible
 but not with God: for with God all things are possible.","And Jesus answered and said
 Verily I say unto you
 There is no man that hath left house
 or brethren
 or sisters
 or father
 or mother
 or wife
 or children
 or lands
 for my sake
 and the gospel's
","But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time
 houses
 and brethren
 and sisters
 and mothers
 and children
 and lands
 with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.","But many that are first shall be last; and the last first.","Saying
 Behold
 we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests
 and unto the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death
 and shall deliver him to the Gentiles:","And they shall mock him
 and shall scourge him
 and shall spit upon him
 and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again.","And James and John
 the sons of Zebedee
 come unto him
 saying
 Master
 we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire.","And he said unto them
 What would ye that I should do for you?","But Jesus said unto them
 Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?","And they said unto him
 We can. And Jesus said unto them
 Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:","But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared.","But Jesus called them to him
 and saith unto them
 Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them.","But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great among you
 shall be your minister:","And whosoever of you will be the chiefest
 shall be servant of all.","For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto
 but to minister
 and to give his life a ransom for many.","And Jesus stood still
 and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man
 saying unto him
 Be of good comfort
 rise; he calleth thee.","And Jesus answered and said unto him
 What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him
 Lord
 that I might receive my sight.","And Jesus said unto him
 Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight
 and followed Jesus in the way.","And saith unto them
 Go your way into the village over against you: and as soon as ye be entered into it
 ye shall find a colt tied
 whereon never man sat; loose him
 and bring him.","And if any man say unto you
 Why do ye this? say ye that the Lord hath need of him; and straightway he will send him hither.","And Jesus answered and said unto it
 No man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever. And his disciples heard it.","And he taught
 saying unto them
 Is it not written
 My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer? but ye have made it a den of thieves.","And Jesus answering saith unto them
 Have faith in God.","For verily I say unto you
 That whosoever shall say unto this mountain
 Be thou removed
 and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart
 but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.","Therefore I say unto you
 What things soever ye desire
 when ye pray
 believe that ye receive them
 and ye shall have them.","And when ye stand praying
 forgive
 if ye have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.","And Jesus answered and said unto them
 I will also ask of you one question
 and answer me
 and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.","The baptism of John
 was it from heaven
 or of men? answer me.","And they answered and said unto Jesus
 We cannot tell. And Jesus answering saith unto them
 Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.","And he began to speak unto them by parables. A certain man planted a vineyard
 and set an hedge about it
 and digged a place for the winefat
 and built a tower
 and let it out to husbandmen
 and went into a far country.","And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant
 that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.","And they caught him
 and beat him
 and sent him away empty.","And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast stones
 and wounded him in the head
 and sent him away shamefully handled.","And again he sent another; and him they killed
 and many others; beating some
 and killing some.","Having yet therefore one son
 his wellbeloved
 he sent him also last unto them
 saying
 They will reverence my son.","But those husbandmen said among themselves
 This is the heir; come
 let us kill him
 and the inheritance shall be ours.'","And they took him
 and killed him
 and cast him out of the vineyard.","What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen
 and will give the vineyard unto others.","And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner:","This was the Lord's doing
 and it is marvellous in our eyes?","And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians
 to catch him in his words.","Shall we give
 or shall we not give? But he
 knowing their hypocrisy
 said unto them
 Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny
 that I may see it.","And they brought it. And he saith unto them
 Whose is this image and superscription? And they said unto him
 Caesar's.","And Jesus answering said unto them
 Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's
 and to God the things that are God's. And they marvelled at him.","And Jesus answering said unto them
 Do ye not therefore err
 because ye know not the scriptures
 neither the power of God?","For when they shall rise from the dead
 they neither marry
 nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven.","And as touching the dead
 that they rise: have ye not read in the book of Moses
 how in the bush God spake unto him
 saying
 I am the God of Abraham
 and the God of Isaac
 and the God of Jacob?","He is not the God of the dead
 but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err.","And one of the scribes came
 and having heard them reasoning together
 and perceiving that he had answered them well
 asked him
 Which is the first commandment of all?","And Jesus answered him
 The first of all the commandments is
 Hear
 O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:","And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart
 and with all thy soul
 and with all thy mind
 and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment.","And the second is like
 namely this
 Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.","And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly
 he said unto him
 Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him any question.","And Jesus answered and said
 while he taught in the temple
 How say the scribes that Christ is the son of David?","For David himself said by the Holy Ghost
 The Lord said to my Lord
 Sit thou on my right hand
 till I make thine enemies thy footstool.","David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he then his son? And the common people heard him gladly.","And he said unto them in his doctrine
 Beware of the scribes
 which love to go in long clothing
 and love salutations in the marketplaces
","And the chief seats in the synagogues
 and the uppermost rooms at feasts:","Which devour widows' houses
 and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation.","And he called unto him his disciples
 and saith unto them
 Verily I say unto you
 That this poor widow hath cast more in
 than all they which have cast into the treasury:","For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had
 even all her living.","And as he went out of the temple
 one of his disciples saith unto him
 Master
 see what manner of stones and what buildings are here!","And Jesus answering said unto him
 Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another
 that shall not be thrown down.","And Jesus answering them began to say
 Take heed lest any man deceive you:","For many shall come in my name
 saying
 I am Christ; and shall deceive many.","And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars
 be ye not troubled: for such things must needs be; but the end shall not be yet.","For nation shall rise against nation
 and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places
 and there shall be famines and troubles: these are the beginnings of sorrows.","But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake
 for a testimony against them.","And the gospel must first be published among all nations.","But when they shall lead you
 and deliver you up
 take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak
 neither do ye premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour
 that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak
 but the Holy Ghost.","Now the brother shall betray the brother to death
 and the father the son; and children shall rise up against their parents
 and shall cause them to be put to death.","And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that shall endure unto the end
 the same shall be saved.","But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation
 spoken of by Daniel the prophet
 standing where it ought not
 (let him that readeth understand
) then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains:","And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house
 neither enter therein
 to take any thing out of his house:","And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment.","But woe to them that are with child
 and to them that give suck in those days!","And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter.","For in those days shall be affliction
 such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created unto this time
 neither shall be.","And except that the Lord had shortened those days
 no flesh should be saved: but for the elect's sake
 whom he hath chosen
 he hath shortened the days.","And then if any man shall say to you
 Lo
 here is Christ; or
 lo
 he is there; believe him not:","For false Christs and false prophets shall rise
 and shall shew signs and wonders
 to seduce
 if it were possible
 even the elect.","But take ye heed: behold
 I have foretold you all things.","But in those days
 after that tribulation
 the sun shall be darkened
 and the moon shall not give her light
","And the stars of heaven shall fall
 and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken.","And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.","And then shall he send his angels
 and shall gather together his elect from the four winds
 from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven.","Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When her branch is yet tender
 and putteth forth leaves
 ye know that summer is near:","So ye in like manner
 when ye shall see these things come to pass
 know that it is nigh
 even at the doors.","Verily I say unto you
 that this generation shall not pass
 till all these things be done.","Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.","But of that day and that hour knoweth no man
 no
 not the angels which are in heaven
 neither the Son
 but the Father.","Take ye heed
 watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.","For the Son of Man is as a man taking a far journey
 who left his house
 and gave authority to his servants
 and to every man his work
 and commanded the porter to watch.","Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh
 at even
 or at midnight
 or at the cockcrowing
 or in the morning:","Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.","And what I say unto you I say unto all
 Watch.","And there were some that had indignation within themselves
 and said
 Why was this waste of the ointment made?","And Jesus said
 Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me.","For ye have the poor with you always
 and whensoever ye will ye may do them good: but me ye have not always.","She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying.","Verily I say unto you
 Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world
 this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.","And he sendeth forth two of his disciples
 and saith unto them
 Go ye into the city
 and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him.","And wheresoever he shall go in
 say ye to the goodman of the house
 The Master saith
 Where is the guestchamber
 where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?","And he will shew you a large upper room furnished and prepared: there make ready for us.","And as they sat and did eat
 Jesus said
 Verily I say unto you
 One of you which eateth with me shall betray me.","And he answered and said unto them
 It is one of the twelve
 that dippeth with me in the dish.","The Son of man indeed goeth
 as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had never been born.","And as they did eat
 Jesus took bread
 and blessed
 and brake it
 and gave to them
 and said
 Take
 eat: this is my body.","And he said unto them
 This is my blood of the new testament
 which is shed for many.","Verily I say unto you
 I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine
 until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God.","And Jesus saith unto them
 All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written
 I will smite the shepherd
 and the sheep shall be scattered.","But after that I am risen
 I will go before you into Galilee.","And Jesus saith unto him
 Verily I say unto thee
 That this day
 even in this night
 before the cock crow twice
 thou shalt deny me thrice.","And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples
 Sit ye here
 while I shall pray.","And saith unto them
 My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: tarry ye here
 and watch.","And he said
 Abba
 Father
 all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will
 but what thou wilt.","And he cometh
 and findeth them sleeping
 and saith unto Peter
 Simon
 sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour?","Watch ye and pray
 lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready
 but the flesh is weak.","And he cometh the third time
 and saith unto them
 Sleep on now
 and take your rest: it is enough
 the hour is come; behold
 the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.","Rise up
 let us go; lo
 he that betrayeth me is at hand.","And Jesus answered and said unto them
 Are ye come out
 as against a thief
 with swords and with staves to take me?","I was daily with you in the temple teaching
 and ye took me not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled.","And Jesus said
 I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power
 and coming in the clouds of heaven.","And some began to spit on him
 and to cover his face
 and to buffet him
 and to say unto him
 Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands.","And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him
 Before the cock crow twice
 thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon
 he wept.","And Pilate asked him
 Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto them
 Thou sayest it.","But Pilate answered them
 saying
 Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?","And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice
 saying
 Eloi
 Eloi
 lama sabachthani? which is
 being interpreted
 My God
 my God
 why hast thou forsaken me?","And when the centurion
 which stood over against him
 saw that he so cried out
 and gave up the ghost
 he said
 Truly this man was the Son of God.","And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto him the centurion
 he asked him whether he had been any while dead.","And they said among themselves
 Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre?","And he saith unto them
 Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth
 which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him.","And he said unto them
 Go ye into all the world
 and preach the gospel to every creature.","He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.","And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;","They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing
 it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick
 and they shall recover.","The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ.","and saying
 \u201cThe time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe in the gospel!\u201d","And Jesus said to them
 \u201cFollow me and I will make you become fishers of people.\u201d ","And Jesus rebuked him
 saying
 \u201cBe silent
 and come out of him!\u201d ","And they found him and said to him
 \u201cEveryone is looking for you!\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cLet us go elsewhere
 into the neighboring rural towns
 so that I can preach there also
 because I have come out for this very reason.\u201d ","And becoming angry
 he stretched out his hand and touched him
 and said to him
 \u201cI am willing; be made clean.\u201d ","And he said to him
 \u201cSee to it that you say nothing to anyone
 but go
 show yourself to the priest and bring for your cleansing the things which Moses commanded
 for a testimony to them. ","And when Jesus saw their faith
 he said to the paralytic
 \u201cChild
 your sins are forgiven.\u201d","And immediately Jesus
 perceiving in his spirit that they were reasoning like this within themselves
 said to them
 \u201cWhy are you considering these things in your hearts? ","Which is easier to say to the paralytic
 \u2018Your sins are forgiven
\u2019 or to say \u2018Get up and pick up your stretcher and walk\u2019? ","But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins
\u201d\u2014he said to the paralytic\u2014","\u201cI say to you
 get up
 pick up your stretcher
 and go to your home.\u201d ","And as he was passing by
 he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax booth
 and he said to him
 \u201cFollow me!\u201d And he stood up and followed him.","And when Jesus heard it
 he said to them
 \u201cThose who are healthy do not have need of a physician
 but those who are sick. I have not come to call the righteous
 but sinners.\u201d","And Jesus said to them
 \u201cThe bridegroom\u2019s attendants are not able to fast while the bridegroom is with them
 are they? As long a time as they have the bridegroom with them
 they are not able to fast. ","But days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them
 and then they will fast in that day. ","No one sews a patch of unshrunken cloth on an old garment. Otherwise the patch pulls away from it\u2014the new from the old\u2014and the tear becomes worse.","And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise the wine will burst the wineskins and the wine is destroyed and the wineskins too. But new wine is put into new wineskins.\u201d","And the Pharisees began to say to him
 \u201cBehold
 why are they doing what is not permitted on the Sabbath?\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cHave you never read what David did when he had need and he and those who were with him were hungry\u2014","And he said to them
 \u201cThe Sabbath was established for people
 and not people for the Sabbath. ","So then
 the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath.\u201d","And he said to the man who had the withered hand
 \u201cCome into the middle.\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cIs it permitted on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil
 to save life or to kill?\u201d But they were silent. ","And looking around at them with anger
 grieved at the hardness of their hearts
 he said to the man
 \u201cStretch out your hand.\u201d And he stretched it out
 and his hand was restored. ","And he called them to himself and was speaking to them in parables
 \u201cHow can Satan expel Satan? ","And if a kingdom is divided against itself
 that kingdom is not able to stand. ","And if a house is divided against itself
 that house will not be able to stand. ","And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided
 he is not able to stand
 but is at an end! ","But no one is able to enter into the house of a strong man and plunder his property unless he first ties up the strong man
 and then he can thoroughly plunder his house.","\u201cTruly I say to you that all the sins and the blasphemies will be forgiven the sons of men
 however much they blaspheme. ","But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit does not have forgiveness forever
 but is guilty of an eternal sin\u201d\u2014","And a crowd was sitting around him
 and they told him
 \u201cBehold
 your mother and your brothers are outside looking for you.\u201d ","And he answered them and said
 \u201cWho is my mother or my brothers?\u201d ","And looking around at those who were sitting around him in a circle
 he said
 \u201cBehold
 my mother and my brothers! ","For whoever does the will of God
 this person is my brother and sister and mother.\u201d","And he began to teach them many things in parables
 and was saying to them in his teaching
 ","\u201cListen! Behold
 the sower went out to sow. ","And it happened that while he was sowing
 some seed fell on the side of the path
 and the birds came and devoured it. ","And other seed fell on the rocky ground where it did not have much soil
 and it sprang up at once
 because it did not have any depth of soil. ","And when the sun rose it was scorched
 and because it did not have enough root
 it withered. ","And other seed fell among the thorn plants
 and the thorn plants came up and choked it
 and it did not produce grain. ","And other seed fell on the good soil
 and produced grain
 coming up and increasing
 and it bore a crop\u2014one thirty and one sixty and one a hundred times as much. ","And he said
 \u201cWhoever has ears to hear
 let him hear!\u201d","And he said to them
 \u201cTo you has been granted the secret of the kingdom of God
 but to those who are outside everything is in parables
 ","so that \u2018they may look closely and not perceive
 and they may listen carefully and not understand
 lest they turn and it be forgiven them.\u2019\u201d","And he said to them
 \u201cDo you not understand this parable? And how will you understand all the parables? ","The sower sows the word.","And these are the ones beside the path where the word is sown
 and whenever they hear it
 immediately Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them. ","And these are like the ones sown on the rocky ground
 who whenever they hear the word immediately receive it with joy. ","And they have no root in themselves
 but are temporary. Then when affliction or persecution comes because of the word
 immediately they fall away. ","And others are the ones sown among the thorn plants\u2014these are the ones who hear the word
 ","and the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things come in and choke the word and it becomes unproductive.","And those are the ones sown on the good soil
 who hear the word and receive it and bear fruit\u2014one thirty and one sixty and one a hundred times as much.\u201d","And he said to them
 \u201cSurely a lamp is not brought so that it may be put under a bushel basket or under a bed
 is it? Is it not so that it may be put on a lampstand? ","For nothing is secret except so that it may be revealed
 nor has become hidden except so that it will come to light. ","If anyone has ears to hear
 let him hear!\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cTake care what you hear! With the measure by which you measure out
 it will be measured out to you
 and will be added to you. ","For whoever has
 more will be given to him
 and whoever does not have
 even what he has will be taken away from him.\u201d","And he said
 \u201cThe kingdom of God is like this: like a man scatters seed on the ground. ","And he sleeps and gets up
 night and day
 and the seed sprouts and grows\u2014he does not know how. ","By itself the soil produces a crop: first the grass
 then the head of grain
 then the full grain in the head. ","But when the crop permits
 he sends in the sickle right away
 because the harvest has come.\u201d","And he said
 \u201cWith what can we compare the kingdom of God
 or by what parable can we present it? ","It is like a mustard seed that when sown on the ground
 although it is the smallest of all the seeds that are on the ground
 ","but when it is sown it grows up and becomes the largest of all the garden herbs
 and sends out large branches so that the birds of the sky are able to nest in its shade.\u201d ","And on that day
 when it was evening
 he said to them
 \u201cLet us cross over to the other side.\u201d ","And he woke up and rebuked the wind
 and said to the sea
 \u201cBe quiet! Be silent!\u201d And the wind abated and there was a great calm. ","And he said to them
 \u201cWhy are you fearful? Do you not yet have faith?\u201d ","(For he was saying to him
 \u201cCome out of the man
 unclean spirit!\u201d) ","And he was asking him \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d And he said to him
 \u201cMy name is Legion
 because we are many.\u201d ","And he did not permit him
 but said to him
 \u201cGo to your home to your people and tell them all that the Lord has done for you
 and that he has had mercy on you.\u201d ","for she was saying
 \u201cIf I touch just his clothing
 I will be healed!\u201d ","And his disciples said to him
 \u201cYou see the crowd pressing upon you
 and you say \u2018Who touched me?\u2019\u201d ","But he said to her
 \u201cDaughter
 your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be well from your suffering.\u201d","But Jesus
 ignoring what was said
 told the ruler of the synagogue
 \u201cDo not be afraid\u2014only believe!\u201d ","And when he entered
 he said to them
 \u201cWhy are you agitated and weeping? The child is not dead
 but is sleeping.\u201d ","And taking hold of the child\u2019s hand
 he said to her
 \u201cTalitha koum!\u201d (which is translated
 \u201cLittle girl
 I say to you

 ","And Jesus said to them
 \u201cA prophet is not without honor except in his hometown
 and among his relatives
 and in his own household.\u201d ","And he summoned the twelve and began to send them out two by two
 and gave them authority over the unclean spirits. ","And he said to them
 \u201cWhenever you enter into a house
 stay there until you depart from there. ","And whatever place does not welcome you or listen to you
 as you go out from there
 shake off the dust that is on your feet for a testimony against them.\u201d ","But when Herod heard it
 he said
 \u201cJohn whom I beheaded\u2014this one has been raised!\u201d ","And when the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced and pleased Herod and his dinner guests
 the king said to the girl
 \u201cAsk me for whatever you want
 and I will give it to you.\u201d ","And she went out and said to her mother
 \u201cWhat should I ask for?\u201d And she said
 \u201cThe head of John the baptizer.\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cYou yourselves come privately to an isolated place and rest for a short time.\u201d For those who were coming and going were many
 and they did not even have time to eat. ","But he answered and said to them
 \u201cYou give them something to eat.\u201d And they said to him
 \u201cShould we go and purchase bread for two hundred denarii and give it to them to eat?\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cHow many loaves do you have? Go look!\u201d And when they found out
 they said
 \u201cFive
 and two fish.\u201d ","For they all saw him and were terrified. But immediately he spoke with them and said to them
 \u201cHave courage
 I am he! Do not be afraid!\u201d ","So he said to them
 \u201cIsaiah prophesied correctly about you hypocrites
 as it is written
 \u2018This people honors me with their lips
 but their heart is far
 far away from me.","And they worship me in vain
 teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.\u2019","Abandoning the commandment of God
 you hold fast to the tradition of men.\u201d","And he said to them
 \u201cYou splendidly ignore the commandment of God so that you can keep your tradition. ","For Moses said
 \u2018Honor your father and your mother
\u2019 and
 \u2018The one who speaks evil of father or mother must certainly die.\u2019 ","But you say
 \u2018If a man says to his father or to his mother
 \u201cWhatever benefit you would have received from me is corban\u201d (that is
 a gift to God)
 ","you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or his mother
 ","thus making void the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down
 and you do many similar things such as this.\u201d","And summoning the crowd again
 he said to them
 \u201cListen to me
 all of you
 and understand: ","There is nothing outside of a person that is able to defile him by going into him. But the things that go out of a person are the things that defile a person.\u201d","And he said to them
 \u201cSo are you also without understanding? Do you not understand that everything that is outside that goes into a person is not able to defile him? ","For it does not enter into his heart but into his stomach
 and goes out into the latrine\u201d\u2014thus declaring all foods clean. ","And he said
 \u201cWhat comes out of a person
 that defiles a person. ","For from within
 from the heart of people
 come evil plans
 sexual immoralities
 thefts
 murders
 ","adulteries
 acts of greed
 malicious deeds
 deceit
 licentiousness
 envy
 abusive speech
 pride
 foolishness. ","All these evil things come from within and defile a person.\u201d","And he said to her
 \u201cLet the children be satisfied first
 for it is not right to take the children\u2019s bread and throw it to the dogs!\u201d ","And he said to her
 \u201cBecause of this statement
 go! The demon has gone out of your daughter.\u201d ","And looking up to heaven
 he sighed and said to him
 \u201cEphphatha!\u201d (that is
 \u201cBe opened!\u201d). ","In those days there was again a large crowd
 and they did not have anything they could eat. Summoning the disciples
 he said to them
 ","\u201cI have compassion on the crowd
 because they have remained with me three days already and do not have anything to eat. ","And if I send them away hungry to their homes they will give out on the way
 and some of them have come from far away.\u201d ","And he asked them
 \u201cHow many loaves do you have?\u201d So they said
 \u201cSeven.\u201d ","And sighing deeply in his spirit
 he said
 \u201cWhy does this generation demand a sign? Truly I say to you
 no sign will be given to this generation!\u201d ","And he ordered them
 saying
 \u201cWatch out! Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod!\u201d ","And knowing this
 he said to them
 \u201cWhy are you discussing that you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive or understand? Have your hearts been hardened? ","Although you have eyes
 do you not see? And although you have ears
 do you not hear? And do you not remember? ","When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand how many baskets full of broken pieces did you pick up?\u201d They said to him
 \u201cTwelve.\u201d ","\u201cWhen I also broke the seven loaves for the four thousand
 how many baskets full of broken pieces did you pick up?\u201d And they said to him
 \u201cSeven.\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cDo you not yet understand?\u201d","And he took hold of the blind man\u2019s hand and led him outside the village
 and after spitting in his eyes
 he placed his hands on him and asked him
 \u201cDo you see anything?\u201d ","And he sent him to his home
 saying
 \u201cDo not even go into the village.\u201d","And Jesus and his disciples went out to the villages of Caesarea Philippi
 and on the way he asked his disciples
 saying to them
 \u201cWho do people say that I am?\u201d ","And he asked them
 \u201cBut who do you say that I am?\u201d Peter answered and said to him
 \u201cYou are the Christ!\u201d ","But turning around and seeing his disciples
 he rebuked Peter and said
 \u201cGet behind me
 Satan
 because you are not setting your mind on the things of God
 but the things of people!\u201d","And summoning the crowd together with his disciples
 he said to them
 \u201cIf anyone wants to come after me
 let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. ","For whoever wants to save his life will lose it
 but whoever loses his life on account of me and of the gospel will save it. ","For what does it benefit a person to gain the whole world and forfeit his life?","For what can a person give in exchange for his life?","For whoever is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation
 the Son of Man will also be ashamed of him when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.\u201d","And he said to them
 \u201cTruly I say to you
 that there are some of those standing here who will never experience death until they see the kingdom of God having come with power.\u201d","And Peter answered and said to Jesus
 \u201cRabbi
 it is good that we are here! And let us make three shelters
 one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah.\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cElijah indeed does come first and restores all things. And how is it written concerning the Son of Man that he should suffer many things and be treated with contempt? ","But I tell you that indeed Elijah has come
 and they did to him whatever they wanted
 just as it is written about him.\u201d","And he asked them
 \u201cWhat are you arguing about with them?\u201d ","And he answered them and said
 \u201cO unbelieving generation! How long will I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring him to me!\u201d ","And he asked his father how long it was since this had been happening to him. And he said
 \u201cFrom childhood. ","But Jesus said to him
 \u201cIf you are able! All things are possible for the one who believes!\u201d ","Now when Jesus saw that a crowd was running together
 he rebuked the unclean spirit
 saying to it
 \u201cMute and deaf spirit
 I command you
 come out of him
 and enter into him no more!\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cThis kind can come out by nothing except by prayer.\u201d","for he was teaching his disciples and was telling them
 \u201cThe Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of men
 and they will kill him. And when he is killed
 after three days he will rise.\u201d ","And they came to Capernaum. And after he was in the house
 he asked them
 \u201cWhat were you discussing on the way?\u201d ","And he sat down and called the twelve and said to them
 \u201cIf anyone wants to be first
 he will be last of all and servant of all.\u201d ","And he took a young child and had him stand among them. And taking him in his arms
 he said to them
 ","But Jesus said
 \u201cDo not prevent him
 because there is no one who does a miracle in my name and will be able soon afterward to speak evil of me. ","For whoever is not against us is for us.","For whoever gives you a cup of water to drink in my name because you are Christ\u2019s
 truly I say to you that he will never lose his reward.","\u201cAnd whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin
 it is better for him if instead a large millstone is placed around his neck and he is thrown into the sea. ","And if your hand causes you to sin
 cut it off! It is better for you to enter into life crippled than
 having two hands
 to go into hell\u2014into the unquenchable fire! ","And if your foot causes you to sin
 cut it off! It is better for you to enter into life lame than
 having two feet
 to be thrown into hell! ","And if your eye causes you to sin
 tear it out! It is better for you to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye than
 having two eyes
 to be thrown into hell
 ","\u2018where their worm does not die and the fire is not extinguished.\u2019","For everyone will be salted with fire.","Salt is good
 but if the salt becomes deprived of its salt content
 by what can you make it salty? Have salt among yourselves
 and be at peace with one another.\u201d","And he answered and said to them
 \u201cWhat did Moses command you?\u201d ","But Jesus said to them
 \u201cHe wrote this commandment for you because of your hardness of heart. ","But from the beginning of creation \u2018he made them male and female.","Because of this a man will leave his father and mother and will be joined to his wife
 ","and the two will become one flesh
\u2019 so that they are no longer two but one flesh. ","Therefore what God has joined together
 man must not separate.\u201d","And he said to them
 \u201cWhoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her. ","And if she divorces her husband and marries another
 she commits adultery.\u201d","But when Jesus saw it
 he was indignant
 and said to them
 \u201cLet the young children come to me. Do not forbid them
 for to such belongs the kingdom of God. ","Truly I say to you
 whoever does not welcome the kingdom of God like a young child will never enter into it.\u201d ","So Jesus said to him
 \u201cWhy do you call me good? No one is good except God alone. ","You know the commandments: \u2018Do not murder
 do not commit adultery
 do not steal
 do not give false testimony
 do not defraud
 honor your father and mother.\u2019\u201d ","And he said to him
 \u201cTeacher
 all these I have observed from my youth.\u201d ","And Jesus
 looking at him
 loved him
 and said to him
 \u201cYou lack one thing: Go
 sell all that you have
 and give the proceeds to the poor\u2014and you will have treasure in heaven\u2014and come
 follow me.\u201d ","And Jesus looked around and said to his disciples
 \u201cHow difficult it is for those who possess wealth to enter into the kingdom of God!\u201d ","And the disciples were astounded at his words. But Jesus answered and said to them again
 \u201cChildren
 how difficult it is to enter into the kingdom of God! ","It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter into the kingdom of God.\u201d","And they were very astounded
 saying to one another
 \u201cAnd who can be saved?\u201d ","Jesus looked at them and said
 \u201cWith human beings it is impossible
 but not with God. For all things are possible with God.\u201d ","Jesus said
 \u201cTruly I say to you
 there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields on account of me and on account of the gospel ","who will not receive a hundred times as much now in this time\u2014houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and fields
 together with persecutions\u2014and in the age to come
 eternal life. ","But many who are first will be last
 and the last first.\u201d","\u201cBehold
 we are going up to Jerusalem
 and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the scribes
 and they will condemn him to death and will hand him over to the Gentiles. ","And they will mock him and spit on him and flog him and kill him
 and after three days he will rise.\u201d","And James and John
 the sons of Zebedee
 came up to him and said to him
 \u201cTeacher
 we want you to do for us whatever we ask you.\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cWhat do you want that I do for you?\u201d ","But Jesus said to them
 \u201cYou do not know what you are asking! Are you able to drink the cup that I drink
 or to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?\u201d ","And they said to him
 \u201cWe are able.\u201d So Jesus said to them
 \u201cYou will drink the cup that I drink
 and you will be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with
 ","but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant
 but is for those for whom it has been prepared.\u201d ","And Jesus called them to himself and said to them
 \u201cYou know that those who are considered to rule over the Gentiles lord it over them
 and their people in high positions exercise authority over them. ","But it is not like this among you! But whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant
 ","and whoever wants to be most prominent among you must be the slave of all.","For even the Son of Man did not come to be served
 but to serve
 and to give his life as a ransom for many.\u201d","And Jesus stopped and said
 \u201cCall him.\u201d And they called the blind man and said to him
 \u201cHave courage! Get up! He is calling you.\u201d ","And Jesus answered him and said
 \u201cWhat do you want me to do for you?\u201d And the blind man said to him
 \u201cRabboni
 that I may regain my sight.\u201d ","And Jesus said to him
 \u201cGo
 your faith has healed you.\u201d And immediately he regained his sight and began to follow him on the road.","and said to them
 \u201cGo into the village before you
 and right away as you enter into it you will find a colt tied
 on which no one has ever sat. Untie it and bring it. ","And if anyone says to you
 \u2018Why are you doing this?\u2019 say \u2018The Lord has need of it
 and will send it here again at once.\u2019\u201d ","And he responded and said to it
 \u201cLet no one eat fruit from you any more forever!\u201d And his disciples heard it.","And he began to teach and was saying to them
 \u201cIs it not written
 \u2018My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations
\u2019 but you have made it a cave of robbers!\u201d ","And Jesus answered and said to them
 \u201cHave faith in God! ","Truly I say to you that whoever says to this mountain
 \u2018Be lifted up and thrown into the sea!\u2019 and does not doubt in his heart
 but believes that what he says will happen
 it will be done for him. ","For this reason I say to you
 whatever you pray and ask for
 believe that you have received it
 and it will be done for you. ","And whenever you stand praying
 if you have anything against anyone
 forgive him
 so that your Father who is in heaven will also forgive you your sins.\u201d","So Jesus said to them
 \u201cI will ask you one question. Answer me and I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things. ","The baptism of John\u2014was it from heaven or from men? Answer me!\u201d","And they replied to Jesus saying
 \u201cWe do not know.\u201d And Jesus said to them
 \u201cNeither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.\u201d","And he began to speak to them in parables: \u201cA man planted a vineyard
 and put a fence around it
 and dug a trough for the winepress
 and built a watchtower
 and leased it to tenant farmers
 and went on a journey. ","And he sent a slave to the tenant farmers at the proper time
 so that he could collect some of the fruit of the vineyard from the tenant farmers. ","And they seized him and beat him and sent him away empty-handed.","And again he sent to them another slave
 and that one they struck on the head and dishonored. ","And he sent another
 and that one they killed. And he sent many others
 some of whom they beat and some of whom they killed. ","He had one more
 a beloved son. Last of all he sent him to them
 saying
 \u2018They will respect my son.\u2019 ","But those tenant farmers said to one another
 \u2018This is the heir. Come
 let us kill him and the inheritance will be ours!\u2019 ","And they seized and killed him and threw him out of the vineyard.","What will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the tenant farmers and give the vineyard to others.","Have you not read this scripture: \u2018The stone which the builders rejected
 this has become the cornerstone.","This came about from the Lord
 and it is marvelous in our eyes\u2019?\u201d","And they sent some of the Pharisees and the Herodians to him so that they could catch him unawares in a statement.","But because he knew their hypocrisy
 he said to them
 \u201cWhy are you testing me? Bring me a denarius so that I can look at it!\u201d ","So they brought one. And he said to them
 \u201cWhose image and inscription is this?\u201d And they said to him
 \u201cCaesar\u2019s.\u201d ","And Jesus said to them
 \u201cGive to Caesar the things of Caesar
 and to God the things of God!\u201d And they were utterly amazed at him.","Jesus said to them
 \u201cAre you not deceived because of this
 because you do not know the scriptures or the power of God? ","For when they rise from the dead
 they neither marry nor are given in marriage
 but are like angels in heaven. ","Now concerning the dead
 that they are raised
 have you not read in the book of Moses in the passage about the bush how God spoke to him
 saying
 \u2018I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob\u2019? ","He is not God of the dead
 but of the living. You are very much mistaken!\u201d","And one of the scribes came up and heard them debating. When he saw that he answered them well
 he asked him
 \u201cWhich commandment is the most important of all?\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cThe most important is
 \u2018Listen
 Israel! The Lord our God
 the Lord is one. ","And you shall love the Lord your God from your whole heart and from your whole soul and from your whole mind and from your whole strength.\u2019","The second is this: \u2018You shall love your neighbor as yourself.\u2019 There is no other commandment greater than these.\u201d","And Jesus
 when he saw that he had answered thoughtfully
 said to him
 \u201cYou are not far from the kingdom of God.\u201d And no one dared to put a question to him any longer.","And continuing
 Jesus said while teaching in the temple courts
 \u201cHow can the scribes say that the Christ is David\u2019s son? ","David himself said by the Holy Spirit
 \u2018The Lord said to my Lord
 \u201cSit at my right hand
 until I put your enemies under your feet.\u201d\u2019","David himself calls him \u2018Lord
\u2019 and how is he his son?\u201d And the large crowd was listening to him gladly.","And in his teaching he said
 \u201cBeware of the scribes
 who like walking around in long robes and greetings in the marketplaces ","and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets
 ","who devour the houses of widows and pray lengthy prayers for the sake of appearance. These will receive more severe condemnation!\u201d","And summoning his disciples
 he said to them
 \u201cTruly I say to you that this poor widow put in more than all those who put offerings into the contribution box. ","For they all contributed out of their abundance
 but she out of her poverty put in everything she had
 her whole means of subsistence.\u201d","And as he was going out of the temple courts
 one of his disciples said to him
 \u201cTeacher
 look! What great stones and what wonderful buildings!\u201d ","And Jesus said to him
 \u201cDo you see these great buildings? Not one stone will be left here on another stone that will not be thrown down!\u201d","So Jesus began to say to them
 \u201cWatch out that no one deceives you! ","Many will come in my name
 saying
 \u2018I am he
\u2019 and they will deceive many. ","And when you hear about wars and rumors of wars
 do not be alarmed. This must happen
 but the end is not yet. ","For nation will rise up against nation and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places. There will be famines. These things are the beginning of birth pains.","\u201cBut you
 watch out for yourselves! They will hand you over to councils and you will be beaten in the synagogues and will have to stand before governors and kings because of me
 for a witness to them. ","And the gospel must first be proclaimed to all the nations.","And when they arrest you and hand you over
 do not be anxious beforehand what you should say
 but whatever is given to you at that hour
 say this. For you are not the ones who are speaking
 but the Holy Spirit. ","And brother will hand over brother to death
 and a father his child
 and children will rise up against parents and have them put to death. ","And you will be hated by all because of my name. But the one who endures to the end\u2014this one will be saved.","\u201cBut when you see the abomination of desolation standing where it should not be\u201d (let the one who reads understand)
 \u201cthen those in Judea must flee to the mountains! ","The one who is on his housetop must not come down or go inside to take anything out of his house
 ","and the one who is in the field must not turn back to pick up his cloak.","And woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing their babies in those days!","But pray that it will not happen in winter.","For in those days there will be tribulation of such a kind as has not happened from the beginning of the creation that God created until now
 and never will happen. ","And if the Lord had not shortened the days
 no human being would be saved. But for the sake of the elect
 whom he chose
 he has shortened the days.","\u201cAnd at that time if anyone should say to you
 \u201cBehold
 here is the Christ
\u2019 \u2018Behold
 there he is
\u2019 do not believe him! ","For false messiahs and false prophets will appear
 and will produce signs and wonders in order to mislead
 if possible
 the elect. ","But you
 watch out! I have told you everything ahead of time!","\u201cBut in those days
 after that tribulation
 \u2018the sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light
","and the stars will be falling from heaven
 and the powers in the heavens will be shaken.\u2019","And then they will see the Son of Man arriving in the clouds with great power and glory.","And then he will send out the angels
 and will gather the elect together from the four winds
 from the end of the earth to the end of heaven.","\u201cNow learn the parable from the fig tree: Whenever its branch has already become tender and puts forth its leaves
 you know that summer is near. ","So also you
 when you see these things happening
 know that he is near
 at the door. ","Truly I say to you that this generation will never pass away until all these things take place!","Heaven and earth will pass away
 but my words will never pass away.","\u201cBut concerning that day or hour no one knows\u2014not even the angels in heaven nor the Son\u2014except the Father.","Watch out! Be alert
 because you do not know when the time is! ","It is like a man away on a journey
 who left his house and gave his slaves authority\u2014to each one his work\u2014and to the doorkeeper he gave orders that he should be on the alert. ","Therefore be on the alert
 for you do not know when the master of the house is coming\u2014whether in the evening
 or at midnight
 or when the rooster crows
 or early in the morning\u2014","lest he arrive suddenly and find you sleeping.","And what I say to you
 I say to everyone: Be on the alert!\u201d","But some were expressing indignation to one another: \u201cWhy has there been this waste of perfumed oil?","But Jesus said
 \u201cLeave her alone. Why do you cause trouble for her? She has done a good deed to me. ","For the poor you always have with you
 and you can do good for them whenever you want
 but you do not always have me. ","She has done what she could; she has anointed my body beforehand for burial.","And truly I say to you
 wherever the gospel is proclaimed in the whole world
 what she has done will also be told in memory of her.","And he sent two of his disciples and said to them
 \u201cGo into the city and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him
 ","and wherever he enters

 \u2018The Teacher says
 \u201cWhere is my guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?\u201d\u2019 ","And he will show you a large upstairs room furnished and ready
 and prepare for us there.\u201d ","And while they were reclining at table and eating

 that one of you who is eating with me will betray me.\u201d ","But he said to them
 \u201cIt is one of the twelve\u2014the one who is dipping bread into the bowl with me. ","For the Son of Man is going just as it is written about him

 \u201cSit here while I pray.\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cMy soul is deeply grieved

 \u201cHave you come out with swords and clubs
 as against a robber

 and you did not arrest me! But this has happened in order that the scriptures would be fulfilled. ","And Jesus said
 \u201cI am
 and you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power and coming with the clouds of heaven.\u201d ","And some began to spit on him and to cover his face and to strike him with their fists
 and to say to him \u201cProphesy!\u201d And the officers received him with slaps in the face.","And immediately a rooster crowed for the second time. And Peter remembered the statement
 how Jesus had said to him
 \u201cBefore the rooster crows twice
 you will deny me three times
\u201d and throwing himself down
 he began to weep.","And Pilate asked him
 \u201cAre you the king of the Jews?\u201d And he answered him and said
 \u201cYou say so.\u201d ","So Pilate answered them
 saying
 \u201cDo you want me to release for you the king of the Jews?\u201d ","And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice
 \u201cEloi
 Eloi
 lema sabachthani?\u201d (which is translated
 \u201cMy God
 my God
 why have you forsaken me?\u201d) ","And when the centurion who was standing opposite him saw that he expired like this
 he said
 \u201cTruly this man was God\u2019s Son!\u201d ","And Pilate was surprised that he was already dead
 and summoning the centurion
 asked him whether he had died already. ","And they were saying to one another
 \u201cWho will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?\u201d ","But he said to them
 \u201cDo not be alarmed. You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene who was crucified. He has been raised
 he is not here! See the place where they laid him! ","And he said to them
 \u201cGo into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation. ","The one who believes and is baptized will be saved
 but the one who refuses to believe will be condemned. ","And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will expel demons
 they will speak in new tongues
 ","they will pick up snakes. And if they drink any deadly poison it will never hurt them; they will lay hands on the sick and they will get well.\u201d","The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ [the Son of God].","\u201cThis is the time of fulfillment. The kingdom of God is at hand. Repent
 and believe in the gospel.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cCome after me
 and I will make you fishers of men.\u201d ","Jesus rebuked him and said
 \u201cQuiet! Come out of him!\u201d ","and on finding him said
 \u201cEveryone is looking for you.\u201d ","He told them
 \u201cLet us go on to the nearby villages that I may preach there also. For this purpose have I come.\u201d ","Moved with pity
 he stretched out his hand
 touched him
 and said to him
 \u201cI do will it. Be made clean.\u201d ","Then he said to him
 \u201cSee that you tell no one anything
 but go
 show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing what Moses prescribed; that will be proof for them.\u201d ","When Jesus saw their faith
 he said to the paralytic
 \u201cChild
 your sins are forgiven.\u201d ","Jesus immediately knew in his mind what they were thinking to themselves
 so he said
 \u201cWhy are you thinking such things in your hearts? ","Which is easier
 to say to the paralytic
 \u2018Your sins are forgiven
\u2019 or to say
 \u2018Rise
 pick up your mat and walk\u2019? ","But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority to forgive sins on earth\u201d\u2014 ","he said to the paralytic
 \u201cI say to you
 rise
 pick up your mat
 and go home.\u201d ","As he passed by
 he saw Levi
 son of Alphaeus
 sitting at the customs post. He said to him
 \u201cFollow me.\u201d And he got up and followed him. ","Jesus heard this and said to them 
 \u201cThose who are well do not need a physician
 but the sick do. I did not come to call the righteous but sinners.\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cCan the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast. ","But the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them
 and then they will fast on that day. ","No one sews a piece of unshrunken cloth on an old cloak. If he does
 its fullness pulls away
 the new from the old
 and the tear gets worse. ","Likewise
 no one pours new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise
 the wine will burst the skins
 and both the wine and the skins are ruined. Rather
 new wine is poured into fresh wineskins.\u201d","At this the Pharisees said to him
 \u201cLook
 why are they doing what is unlawful on the sabbath?\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cHave you never read what David did when he was in need and he and his companions were hungry? ","Then he said to them
 \u201cThe sabbath was made for man
 not man for the sabbath. ","That is why the Son of Man is lord even of the sabbath.\u201d","He said to the man with the withered hand
 \u201cCome up here before us.\u201d ","Then he said to them
 \u201cIs it lawful to do good on the sabbath rather than to do evil
 to save life rather than to destroy it?\u201d But they remained silent. ","Looking around at them with anger and grieved at their hardness of heart
 he said to the man
 \u201cStretch out your hand.\u201d He stretched it out and his hand was restored. ","Summoning them
 he began to speak to them in parables
 \u201cHow can Satan drive out Satan?","If a kingdom is divided against itself
 that kingdom cannot stand. ","And if a house is divided against itself
 that house will not be able to stand. ","And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided
 he cannot stand; that is the end of him. ","But no one can enter a strong man\u2019s house to plunder his property unless he first ties up the strong man. Then he can plunder his house. ","Amen
 I say to you
 all sins and all blasphemies that people utter will be forgiven them. ","But whoever blasphemes against the holy Spirit will never have forgiveness
 but is guilty of an everlasting sin.\u201d ","A crowd seated around him told him
 \u201cYour mother and your brothers [and your sisters] are outside asking for you.\u201d ","But he said to them in reply
 \u201cWho are my mother and  brothers?\u201d ","And looking around at those seated in the circle he said
 \u201cHere are my mother and my brothers. "," whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother.\u201d","And he taught them at length in parables
 and in the course of his instruction he said to them
 ","\u201cHear this! A sower went out to sow. ","And as he sowed
 some seed fell on the path
 and the birds came and ate it up. ","Other seed fell on rocky ground where it had little soil. It sprang up at once because the soil was not deep. ","And when the sun rose
 it was scorched and it withered for lack of roots. ","Some seed fell among thorns
 and the thorns grew up and choked it and it produced no grain. ","And some seed fell on rich soil and produced fruit. It came up and grew and yielded thirty
 sixty
 and a hundredfold.\u201d ","He added
 \u201cWhoever has ears to hear ought to hear.\u201d","He answered them
 \u201cThe mystery of the kingdom of God has been granted to you. But to those outside everything comes in parables
 ","so that \u2018they may look and see but not perceive
 and hear and listen but not understand
 in order that they may not be converted and be forgiven.\u2019\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cDo you not understand this parable? Then how will you understand any of the parables? ","The sower sows the word. ","These are the ones on the path where the word is sown. As soon as they hear
 Satan comes at once and takes away the word sown in them. ","And these are the ones sown on rocky ground who
 when they hear the word
 receive it at once with joy. ","But they have no root; they last only for a time. Then when tribulation or persecution comes because of the word
 they quickly fall away. ","Those sown among thorns are another sort. They are the people who hear the word
 ","but worldly anxiety
 the lure of riches
 and the craving for other things intrude and choke the word
 and it bears no fruit. ","But those sown on rich soil are the ones who hear the word and accept it and bear fruit thirty and sixty and a hundredfold.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cIs a lamp brought in to be placed under a bushel basket or under a bed
 and not to be placed on a lampstand?","For there is nothing hidden except to be made visible; nothing is secret except to come to light. ","Anyone who has ears to hear ought to hear.\u201d ","He also told them
 \u201cTake care what you hear. The measure with which you measure will be measured out to you
 and still more will be given to you. ","To the one who has
 more will be given; from the one who has not
 even what he has will be taken away.\u201d","He said
 \u201cThis is how it is with the kingdom of God; it is as if a man were to scatter seed on the land","and would sleep and rise night and day and the seed would sprout and grow
 he knows not how. ","Of its own accord the land yields fruit
 first the blade
 then the ear
 then the full grain in the ear. ","And when the grain is ripe
 he wields the sickle at once
 for the harvest has come.\u201d","He said
 \u201cTo what shall we compare the kingdom of God
 or what parable can we use for it?","It is like a mustard seed that
 when it is sown in the ground
 is the smallest of all the seeds on the earth. ","But once it is sown
 it springs up and becomes the largest of plants and puts forth large branches
 so that the birds of the sky can dwell in its shade.\u201d ","On that day
 as evening drew on
 he said to them
 \u201cLet us cross to the other side.\u201d","He woke up
 rebuked the wind
 and said to the sea
 \u201cQuiet! Be still!\u201d The wind ceased and there was great calm. ","Then he asked them
 \u201cWhy are you terrified? Do you not yet have faith?\u201d ","(He had been saying to him
 \u201cUnclean spirit
 come out of the man!\u201d) ","He asked him
 \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d He replied
 \u201cLegion is my name. There are many of us.\u201d ","But he would not permit him but told him instead
 \u201cGo home to your family and announce to them all that the Lord in his pity has done for you.\u201d ","She said
 \u201cIf I but touch his clothes
 I shall be cured.\u201d ","But his disciples said to him
 \u201cYou see how the crowd is pressing upon you
 and yet you ask
 \u2018Who touched me?\u2019\u201d ","He said to her
 \u201cDaughter
 your faith has saved you. Go in peace and be cured of your affliction.\u201d","Disregarding the message that was reported
 Jesus said to the synagogue official
 \u201cDo not be afraid; just have faith.\u201d ","So he went in and said to them
 \u201cWhy this commotion and weeping? The child is not dead but asleep.\u201d ","He took the child by the hand and said to her
 \u201cTalitha koum
\u201d which means
 \u201cLittle girl
 I say to you
 arise!\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cA prophet is not without honor except in his native place and among his own kin and in his own house.\u201d ","He summoned the Twelve and began to send them out two by two and gave them authority over unclean spirits. ","He said to them
 \u201cWherever you enter a house
 stay there until you leave from there. ","Whatever place does not welcome you or listen to you
 leave there and shake the dust off your feet in testimony against them.\u201d ","But when Herod learned of it
 he said
 \u201cIt is John whom I beheaded. He has been raised up.\u201d","Herodias\u2019s own daughter came in and performed a dance that delighted Herod and his guests. The king said to the girl
 \u201cAsk of me whatever you wish and I will grant it to you.\u201d ","She went out and said to her mother
 \u201cWhat shall I ask for?\u201d She replied
 \u201cThe head of John the Baptist.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cCome away by yourselves to a deserted place and rest a while.\u201d People were coming and going in great numbers
 and they had no opportunity even to eat. ","He said to them in reply
 \u201cGive them some food yourselves.\u201d But they said to him
 \u201cAre we to buy two hundred days\u2019 wages worth of food and give it to them to eat?\u201d ","He asked them
 \u201cHow many loaves do you have? Go and see.\u201d And when they had found out they said
 \u201cFive loaves and two fish.\u201d ","They had all seen him and were terrified. But at once he spoke with them
 \u201cTake courage
 it is I
 do not be afraid!\u201d ","He responded
 \u201cWell did Isaiah prophesy about you hypocrites
 as it is written: \u2018This people honors me with their lips
 but their hearts are far from me;","In vain do they worship me
 teaching as doctrines human precepts.\u2019","You disregard God\u2019s commandment but cling to human tradition.\u201d ","He went on to say
 \u201cHow well you have set aside the commandment of God in order to uphold your tradition! ","For Moses said
 \u2018Honor your father and your mother
\u2019 and \u2018Whoever curses father or mother shall die.\u2019 ","Yet you say
 \u2018If a person says to father or mother
 \u201cAny support you might have had from me is qorban\u201d\u2019 (meaning
 dedicated to God)
 ","you allow him to do nothing more for his father or mother. ","You nullify the word of God in favor of your tradition that you have handed on. And you do many such things.\u201d ","He summoned the crowd again and said to them
 \u201cHear me
 all of you
 and understand. ","Nothing that enters one from outside can defile that person; but the things that come out from within are what defile.\u201d  [16 ]","He said to them
 \u201cAre even you likewise without understanding? Do you not realize that everything that goes into a person from outside cannot defile
 ","since it enters not the heart but the stomach and passes out into the latrine?\u201d (Thus he declared all foods clean.) ","\u201cBut what comes out of a person
 that is what defiles. ","From within people
 from their hearts
 come evil thoughts
 unchastity
 theft
 murder
 ","adultery
 greed
 malice
 deceit
 licentiousness
 envy
 blasphemy
 arrogance
 folly. ","All these evils come from within and they defile.\u201d","He said to her
 \u201cLet the children be fed first. For it is not right to take the food of the children and throw it to the dogs.\u201d ","Then he said to her
 \u201cFor saying this
 you may go. The demon has gone out of your daughter.\u201d ","then he looked up to heaven and groaned
 and said to him
 \u201cEphphatha!\u201d (that is
 \u201cBe opened!\u201d) ","In those days when there again was a great crowd without anything to eat
 he summoned the disciples and said
","\u201cMy heart is moved with pity for the crowd
 because they have been with me now for three days and have nothing to eat. ","If I send them away hungry to their homes
 they will collapse on the way
 and some of them have come a great distance.\u201d ","Still he asked them
 \u201cHow many loaves do you have?\u201d \u201cSeven
\u201d they replied. ","He sighed from the depth of his spirit and said
 \u201cWhy does this generation seek a sign? Amen
 I say to you
 no sign will be given to this generation.\u201d ","He enjoined them
 \u201cWatch out
 guard against the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.\u201d ","When he became aware of this he said to them
 \u201cWhy do you conclude that it is because you have no bread? Do you not yet understand or comprehend? Are your hearts hardened? ","Do you have eyes and not see
 ears and not hear? And do you not remember
 ","when I broke the five loaves for the five thousand
 how many wicker baskets full of fragments you picked up?\u201d They answered him
 \u201cTwelve.\u201d ","\u201cWhen I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand
 how many full baskets of fragments did you pick up?\u201d They answered 
 \u201cSeven.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cDo you still not understand?\u201d","He took the blind man by the hand and led him outside the village. Putting spittle on his eyes he laid his hands on him and asked
 \u201cDo you see anything?\u201d ","Then he sent him home and said
 \u201cDo not even go into the village.\u201d III. The Mystery Begins to Be Revealed","Now Jesus and his disciples set out for the villages of Caesarea Philippi. Along the way he asked his disciples
 \u201cWho do people say that I am?\u201d ","And he asked them
 \u201cBut who do you say that I am?\u201d Peter said to him in reply
 \u201cYou are the Messiah.\u201d ","At this he turned around and
 looking at his disciples
 rebuked Peter and said
 \u201cGet behind me
 Satan. You are thinking not as God does
 but as human beings do.\u201d","He summoned the crowd with his disciples and said to them
 \u201cWhoever wishes to come after me must deny himself
 take up his cross
 and follow me.","For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it
 but whoever loses his life for my sake and that of the gospel will save it. ","What profit is there for one to gain the whole world and forfeit his life? ","What could one give in exchange for his life? ","Whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this faithless and sinful generation
 the Son of Man will be ashamed of when he comes in his Father\u2019s glory with the holy angels.\u201d","He also said to them
 \u201cAmen
 I say to you
 there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see that the kingdom of God has come in power.\u201d","Then Peter said to Jesus in reply
 \u201cRabbi
 it is good that we are here! Let us make three tents: one for you
 one for Moses
 and one for Elijah.\u201d ","He told them
 \u201cElijah will indeed come first and restore all things
 yet how is it written regarding the Son of Man that he must suffer greatly and be treated with contempt? ","But I tell you that Elijah has come and they did to him whatever they pleased
 as it is written of him.\u201d","He asked them
 \u201cWhat are you arguing about with them?\u201d ","He said to them in reply
 \u201cO faithless generation
 how long will I be with you? How long will I endure you? Bring him to me.\u201d ","Then he questioned his father
 \u201cHow long has this been happening to him?\u201d He replied
 \u201cSince childhood. ","Jesus said to him
 \u201c\u2018If you can!\u2019 Everything is possible to one who has faith.\u201d ","Jesus
 on seeing a crowd rapidly gathering
 rebuked the unclean spirit and said to it
 \u201cMute and deaf spirit
 I command you: come out of him and never enter him again!\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cThis kind can only come out through prayer.\u201d","He was teaching his disciples and telling them
 \u201cThe Son of Man is to be handed over to men and they will kill him
 and three days after his death he will rise.\u201d ","They came to Capernaum and
 once inside the house
 he began to ask them
 \u201cWhat were you arguing about on the way?\u201d ","Then he sat down
 called the Twelve
 and said to them
 \u201cIf anyone wishes to be first
 he shall be the last of all and the servant of all.\u201d ","Taking a child he placed it in their midst
 and putting his arms around it he said to them
 ","Jesus replied
 \u201cDo not prevent him. There is no one who performs a mighty deed in my name who can at the same time speak ill of me. ","For whoever is not against us is for us. ","Anyone who gives you a cup of water to drink because you belong to Christ

 I say to you
 will surely not lose his reward.","\u201cWhoever causes one of these little ones who believe [in me] to sin
 it would be better for him if a great millstone were put around his neck and he were thrown into the sea.","If your hand causes you to sin
 cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life maimed than with two hands to go into Gehenna
 into the unquenchable fire.  [44 ] ","And if your foot causes you to sin
 cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life crippled than with two feet to be thrown into Gehenna.  [46 ] ","And if your eye causes you to sin
 pluck it out. Better for you to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into Gehenna
 ","where \u2018their worm does not die
 and the fire is not quenched.\u2019","\u201cEveryone will be salted with fire.","Salt is good
 but if salt becomes insipid
 with what will you restore its flavor? Keep salt in yourselves and you will have peace with one another.\u201d","He said to them in reply
 \u201cWhat did Moses command you?\u201d ","But Jesus told them
 \u201cBecause of the hardness of your hearts he wrote you this commandment. ","But from the beginning of creation
 \u2018God made them male and female. ","For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother [and be joined to his wife]
 ","and the two shall become one flesh.\u2019 So they are no longer two but one flesh. ","Therefore what God has joined together
 no human being must separate.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cWhoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her; ","and if she divorces her husband and marries another
 she commits adultery.\u201d","When Jesus saw this he became indignant and said to them
 \u201cLet the children come to me; do not prevent them

 I say to you
 whoever does not accept the kingdom of God like a child will not enter it.\u201d ","Jesus answered him
 \u201cWhy do you call me good? No one is good but God alone. ","You know the commandments: \u2018You shall not kill; you shall not commit adultery; you shall not steal; you shall not bear false witness; you shall not defraud; honor your father and your mother.\u2019\u201d ","He replied and said to him
 \u201cTeacher
 all of these I have observed from my youth.\u201d ","Jesus
 looking at him
 loved him and said to him
 \u201cYou are lacking in one thing. Go
 sell what you have
 and give to  poor and you will have treasure in heaven; then come
 follow me.\u201d ","Jesus looked around and said to his disciples
 \u201cHow hard it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God!\u201d ","The disciples were amazed at his words. So Jesus again said to them in reply
 \u201cChildren
 how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God! ","It is easier for a camel to pass through  eye of  needle than for one who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.\u201d ","They were exceedingly astonished and said among themselves
 \u201cThen who can be saved?\u201d ","Jesus looked at them and said
 \u201cFor human beings it is impossible

 \u201cAmen
 I say to you
 there is no one who has given up house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or lands for my sake and for the sake of the gospel ","who will not receive a hundred times more now in this present age: houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands
 with persecutions

 came to him and said to him

 \u201cWhat do you wish  to do for you?\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cYou do not know what you are asking. Can you drink the cup that I drink or be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?\u201d ","They said to him
 \u201cWe can.\u201d Jesus said to them

 you will drink

 and give the vineyard to others. ","Have you not read this scripture passage: \u2018The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone;","by the Lord has this been done
 and it is wonderful in our eyes\u2019?\u201d","They sent some Pharisees and Herodians to him to ensnare him in his speech.","Knowing their hypocrisy he said to them
 \u201cWhy are you testing me? Bring me a denarius to look at.\u201d ","They brought one to him and he said to them
 \u201cWhose image and inscription is this?\u201d They replied to him
 \u201cCaesar\u2019s.\u201d ","So Jesus said to them
 \u201cRepay to Caesar what belongs to Caesar and to God what belongs to God.\u201d They were utterly amazed at him.","Jesus said to them
 \u201cAre you not misled because you do not know the scriptures or the power of God? ","When they rise from the dead
 they neither marry nor are given in marriage
 but they are like the angels in heaven. ","As for the dead being raised
 have you not read in the Book of Moses
 in the passage about the bush
 how God told him
 \u2018I am the God of Abraham
  God of Isaac
 and  God of Jacob\u2019? ","He is not God of the dead but of the living. You are greatly misled.\u201d","One of the scribes
 when he came forward and heard them disputing and saw how well he had answered them
 asked him
 \u201cWhich is the first of all the commandments?\u201d ","Jesus replied
 \u201cThe first is this: \u2018Hear
 O Israel! The Lord our God is Lord alone! ","You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart
 with all your soul
 with all your mind
 and with all your strength.\u2019 ","The second is this: \u2018You shall love your neighbor as yourself.\u2019 There is no other commandment greater than these.\u201d ","And when Jesus saw that  answered with understanding
 he said to him
 \u201cYou are not far from the kingdom of God.\u201d And no one dared to ask him any more questions.","As Jesus was teaching in the temple area he said
 \u201cHow do the scribes claim that the Messiah is the son of David? ","David himself
 inspired by the holy Spirit
 said: \u2018The Lord said to my lord

 \u201cBeware of the scribes
 who like to go around in long robes and accept greetings in the marketplaces
 ","seats of honor in synagogues
 and places of honor at banquets. ","They devour the houses of widows and
 as a pretext
 recite lengthy prayers. They will receive a very severe condemnation.\u201d","Calling his disciples to himself
 he said to them
 \u201cAmen
 I say to you
 this poor widow put in more than all the other contributors to the treasury. ","For they have all contributed from their surplus wealth
 but she
 from her poverty
 has contributed all she had
 her whole livelihood.\u201d","As he was making his way out of the temple area one of his disciples said to him
 \u201cLook

 \u201cDo you see these great buildings? There will not be one stone left upon another that will not be thrown down.\u201d","Jesus began to say to them
 \u201cSee that no one deceives you. ","Many will come in my name saying
 \u2018I am he
\u2019 and they will deceive many. ","When you hear of wars and reports of wars do not be alarmed; such things must happen
 but it will not yet be the end. ","Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes from place to place and there will be famines. These are the beginnings of the labor pains.","\u201cWatch out for yourselves. They will hand you over to the courts. You will be beaten in synagogues. You will be arraigned before governors and kings because of me
 as a witness before them.","But the gospel must first be preached to all nations. ","When they lead you away and hand you over
 do not worry beforehand about what you are to say. But say whatever will be given to you at that hour. For it will not be you who are speaking but the holy Spirit. ","Brother will hand over brother to death
 and the father his child; children will rise up against parents and have them put to death. ","You will be hated by all because of my name. But the one who perseveres to the end will be saved.","\u201cWhen you see the desolating abomination standing where he should not (let the reader understand)
 then those in Judea must flee to the mountains
"," a person on a housetop must not go down or enter to get anything out of his house
 ","and a person in a field must not return to get his cloak. ","Woe to pregnant women and nursing mothers in those days. ","Pray that this does not happen in winter. ","For those times will have tribulation such as has not been since the beginning of God\u2019s creation until now
 nor ever will be. ","If the Lord had not shortened those days
 no one would be saved; but for the sake of the elect whom he chose
 he did shorten the days. ","If anyone says to you then
 \u2018Look
 here is the Messiah! Look
 there he is!\u2019 do not believe it. ","False messiahs and false prophets will arise and will perform signs and wonders in order to mislead
 if that were possible
 the elect. ","Be watchful! I have told it all to you beforehand.","\u201cBut in those days after that tribulation the sun will be darkened
 and the moon will not give its light
","and the stars will be falling from the sky
 and the powers in the heavens will be shaken.","And then they will see \u2018the Son of Man coming in the clouds\u2019 with great power and glory
 ","and then he will send out the angels and gather  elect from the four winds
 from the end of the earth to the end of the sky.","\u201cLearn a lesson from the fig tree. When its branch becomes tender and sprouts leaves

 this generation will not pass away until all these things have taken place. ","Heaven and earth will pass away
 but my words will not pass away.","\u201cBut of that day or hour
 no one knows
 neither the angels in heaven
 nor the Son

 therefore; you do not know when the lord of the house is coming

 I say to all: \u2018Watch!\u2019\u201d","There were some who were indignant. \u201cWhy has there been this waste of perfumed oil? ","Jesus said
 \u201cLet her alone. Why do you make trouble for her? She has done a good thing for me. ","The poor you will always have with you
 and whenever you wish you can do good to them
 but you will not always have me. ","She has done what she could. She has anticipated anointing my body for burial. ","Amen
 I say to you

 \u201cWhere is my guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?\u201d\u2019 ","Then he will show you a large upper room furnished and ready. Make the preparations for us there.\u201d ","And as they reclined at table and were eating

 \u201cAmen

 the one who dips with me into the dish. ","For the Son of Man indeed goes
 as it is written of him

 he took bread
 said the blessing
 broke it
 and gave it to them
 and said
 \u201cTake it; this is my body.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cThis is my blood of the covenant
 which will be shed for many. ","Amen
 I say to you
 I shall not drink again the fruit of the vine until the day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.\u201d ","Then Jesus said to them
 \u201cAll of you will have your faith shaken

 \u201cSimon
 are you asleep? Could you not keep watch for one hour? ","Watch and pray that you may not undergo the test. The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.\u201d ","He returned a third time and said to them
 \u201cAre you still sleeping and taking your rest? It is enough. The hour has come. Behold
 the Son of Man is to be handed over to sinners. ","Get up
 let us go. See

 \u201cHave you come out as against a robber
 with swords and clubs
 to seize me? ","Day after day I was with you teaching in the temple area

 \u201cTruly this man was the Son of God!\u201d ","Pilate was amazed that he was already dead. He summoned the centurion and asked him if Jesus had already died. ","They were saying to one another

 seeing their faith
 *said to the paralyzed man
 \u201cSon

 aware in His spirit that they were thinking that way within themselves
 *said to them
 \u201cWhy are you thinking about these things in your hearts?","Which is easier

 \u2018Get up

 \u201cLook
 why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?\u201d","And He *said to them

 and was saying to them in His teaching
","\u201cListen to this! Behold
 the sower went out to sow;","as he was sowing
 some seed fell beside the road
 and the birds came and ate it up.","Other seed fell on the rocky ground where it did not have much soil; and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of soil.","And when the sun had risen
 it was scorched; and because it had no root
 it withered away.","Other seed fell among the thorns
 and the thorns came up and choked it
 and it yielded no crop.","Other seeds fell into the good soil
 and as they grew up and increased
 they yielded a crop and produced thirty
 sixty
 and a hundred times as much.\u201d","And He was saying
 \u201cHe who has ears to hear
 let him hear.\u201d","And He was saying to them
 \u201cTo you has been given the mystery of the kingdom of God
 but for those who are outside
 everything comes in parables
","so that while seeing they may see
 and not perceive
 and while hearing
 they may hear
 and not understand
 otherwise they might return and it would be forgiven them.\u201d","And He *said to them
 \u201cDo you not understand this parable? How will you understand all the parables?","The sower sows the word.","These are the ones who are beside the road where the word is sown; and when they hear
 immediately Satan comes and takes away the word which has been sown in them.","And in a similar way these are the ones sown with seed on the rocky places
 who
 when they hear the word
 immediately receive it with joy;","and yet they have no firm root in themselves
 but are only temporary; then
 when affliction or persecution occurs because of the word
 immediately they fall away.","And others are the ones sown with seed among the thorns; these are the ones who have heard the word
","but the worries of the world
 and the deceitfulness of wealth
 and the desires for other things enter and choke the word
 and it becomes unfruitful.","And those are the ones sown with seed on the good soil; and they hear the word and accept it and bear fruit
 thirty
 sixty
 and a hundred times as much.\u201d","And He was saying to them
 \u201cA lamp is not brought to be put under a basket
 or under a bed
 is it? Is it not brought to be put on the lampstand?","For nothing is hidden
 except to be revealed; nor has anything been secret
 but that it would come to light.","If anyone has ears to hear
 let him hear.\u201d","And He was saying to them
 \u201cTake care what you listen to. By your standard of measure it will be measured to you; and more will be given you besides.","For whoever has
 to him more will be given; and whoever does not have
 even what he has will be taken away from him.\u201d","And He was saying
 \u201cThe kingdom of God is like a man who casts seed upon the soil;","and he goes to bed at night and gets up daily
 and the seed sprouts and grows\u2014how
 he himself does not know.","The soil produces crops by itself; first the stalk
 then the head
 then the mature grain in the head.","Now when the crop permits
 he immediately puts in the sickle
 because the harvest has come.\u201d","And He was saying
 \u201cHow shall we picture the kingdom of God
 or by what parable shall we present it?","It is like a mustard seed
 which
 when sown upon the soil
 though it is the smallest of all the seeds that are upon the soil
","yet when it is sown
 it grows up and becomes larger than all the garden plants
 and forms large branches
 with the result that the birds of the sky can nest under its shade.\u201d","On that day
 when evening came
 He *said to them
 \u201cLet\u2019s go over to the other side.\u201d","And He got up and rebuked the wind and said to the sea
 \u201cHush
 be still.\u201d And the wind died down and it became perfectly calm.","And He said to them
 \u201cWhy are you afraid? Do you still have no faith?\u201d","For He had already been saying to him
 \u201cCome out of the man

 \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d And he *said to Him
 \u201cMy name is Legion

 is certainly to be put to death\u2019;","but you say
 \u2018If a person says to his father or his mother

 \u201cGet behind Me
 Satan; for you are not setting your mind on God\u2019s purposes
 but on man\u2019s.\u201d","And He summoned the crowd together with His disciples
 and said to them
 \u201cIf anyone wants to come after Me
 he must deny himself
 take up his cross
 and follow Me.","For whoever wants to save his life will lose it
 but whoever loses his life for My sake and the gospel\u2019s will save it.","For what does it benefit a person to gain the whole world
 and forfeit his soul?","For what could a person give in exchange for his soul?","For whoever is ashamed of Me and My words in this adulterous and sinful generation
 the Son of Man will also be ashamed of him when He comes in the glory of His Father with the holy angels.\u201d","And Jesus was saying to them
 \u201cTruly I say to you
 there are some of those who are standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God when it has come with power.\u201d","Peter responded and *said to Jesus
 \u201cRabbi
 it is good that we are here; let\u2019s make three tabernacles
 one for You
 one for Moses
 and one for Elijah.\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cElijah does come first and he restores all things. And yet how is it written of the Son of Man that He will suffer many things and be treated with contempt?","But I say to you that Elijah has indeed come
 and they did to him whatever they wanted
 just as it is written of him.\u201d","And He asked them
 \u201cWhat are you disputing with them?\u201d","And He answered them and *said
 \u201cO unbelieving generation
 how long shall I be with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring him to Me!\u201d","And He asked his father
 \u201cHow long has this been happening to him?\u201d And he said
 \u201cFrom childhood.","But Jesus said to him
 \u201c\u2018If You can?\u2019 All things are possible for the one who believes.\u201d","When Jesus saw that a crowd was rapidly gathering
 He rebuked the unclean spirit
 saying to it
 \u201cYou mute and deaf spirit
 I command you
 come out of him and do not enter him again!\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cThis kind cannot come out by anything except prayer.\u201d","For He was teaching His disciples and telling them
 \u201cThe Son of Man is to be handed over to men
 and they will kill Him; and when He has been killed
 He will rise three days later.\u201d","They came to Capernaum; and when He was in the house
 He began to question them: \u201cWhat were you discussing on the way?\u201d","And sitting down
 He called the twelve and *said to them
 \u201cIf anyone wants to be first
 he shall be last of all and servant of all.\u201d","And He took a child and placed him among them
 and taking him in His arms
 He said to them
","But Jesus said
 \u201cDo not hinder him
 for there is no one who will perform a miracle in My name
 and be able soon afterward to speak evil of Me.","For the one who is not against us is for us.","For whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because of your name as followers of Christ
 truly I say to you
 he shall by no means lose his reward.","\u201cWhoever causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to sin
 it is better for him if a heavy millstone is hung around his neck and he is thrown into the sea.","And if your hand causes you to sin
 cut it off; it is better for you to enter life maimed
 than
 having your two hands
 to go into hell
 into the unquenchable fire.","And if your foot is causing you to sin
 cut it off; it is better for you to enter life without a foot
 than
 having your two feet
 to be thrown into hell.","And if your eye is causing you to sin
 throw it away; it is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye
 than
 having two eyes
 to be thrown into hell
","where their worm does not die
 and the fire is not extinguished.","For everyone will be salted with fire.","Salt is good; but if the salt becomes unsalty
 with what will you make it salty again? Have salt in yourselves
 and be at peace with one another.\u201d","And He answered and said to them
 \u201cWhat did Moses command you?\u201d","But Jesus said to them
 \u201cBecause of your hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment.","But from the beginning of creation
 God created them male and female.","For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother
","and the two shall become one flesh; so they are no longer two
 but one flesh.","Therefore
 what God has joined together
 no person is to separate.\u201d","And He *said to them
 \u201cWhoever divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her;","and if she herself divorces her husband and marries another man
 she is committing adultery.\u201d","But when Jesus saw this
 He was indignant and said to them
 \u201cAllow the children to come to Me; do not forbid them
 for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.","Truly I say to you
 whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child will not enter it at all.\u201d","But Jesus said to him
 \u201cWhy do you call Me good? No one is good except God alone.","You know the commandments: \u2018Do not murder
 Do not commit adultery
 Do not steal
 Do not give false testimony
 Do not defraud
 Honor your father and mother.\u2019\u201d","And he said to Him
 \u201cTeacher
 I have kept all these things from my youth.\u201d","Looking at him
 Jesus showed love to him and said to him
 \u201cOne thing you lack: go and sell all you possess and give to the poor
 and you will have treasure in heaven; and come
 follow Me.\u201d","And Jesus
 looking around
 *said to His disciples
 \u201cHow hard it will be for those who are wealthy to enter the kingdom of God!\u201d","And the disciples were amazed at His words. But Jesus responded again and *said to them
 \u201cChildren
 how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God!","It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.\u201d","And they were even more astonished
 and said to Him
 \u201cThen who can be saved?\u201d","Looking at them
 Jesus *said
 \u201cWith people it is impossible
 but not with God; for all things are possible with God.\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cTruly I say to you
 there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or farms
 for My sake and for the gospel\u2019s sake
","but that he will receive a hundred times as much now in the present age
 houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and farms
 along with persecutions; and in the age to come
 eternal life.","But many who are first will be last
 and the last
 first.\u201d","saying
 \u201cBehold
 we are going up to Jerusalem
 and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the scribes; and they will condemn Him to death and will hand Him over to the Gentiles.","And they will mock Him and spit on Him
 and flog Him and kill Him; and three days later He will rise from the dead.\u201d","James and John
 the two sons of Zebedee
 *came up to Jesus
 saying to Him
 \u201cTeacher
 we want You to do for us whatever we ask of You.\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cWhat do you want Me to do for you?\u201d","But Jesus said to them
 \u201cYou do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink
 or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?\u201d","They said to Him
 \u201cWe are able.\u201d And Jesus said to them
 \u201cThe cup that I drink you shall drink; and you shall be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized.","But to sit on My right or on My left is not Mine to give; but it is for those for whom it has been prepared.\u201d","Calling them to Himself
 Jesus *said to them
 \u201cYou know that those who are recognized as rulers of the Gentiles domineer over them; and their people in high position exercise authority over them.","But it is not this way among you; rather
 whoever wants to become prominent among you shall be your servant;","and whoever wants to be first among you shall be slave of all.","For even the Son of Man did not come to be served
 but to serve
 and to give His life as a ransom for many.\u201d","And Jesus stopped and said
 \u201cCall him here.\u201d So they *called the man who was blind

 \u201cTake courage
 stand up! He is calling for you.\u201d","And replying to him
 Jesus said
 \u201cWhat do you want Me to do for you?\u201d And the man who was blind said to Him
 \u201cRabboni
 I want to regain my sight!\u201d","And Jesus said to him
 \u201cGo; your faith has made you well.\u201d And immediately he regained his sight and began following Him on the road.","and *said to them
 \u201cGo into the village opposite you
 and immediately as you enter it you will find a colt tied there
 on which no one has ever sat; untie it and bring it here.","And if anyone says to you
 \u2018Why are you doing this?\u2019 say
 \u2018The Lord has need of it\u2019; and immediately he will send it back here.\u201d","And He said to it
 \u201cMay no one ever eat fruit from you again!\u201d And His disciples were listening.","And He began to teach and say to them
 \u201cIs it not written: \u2018My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations\u2019? But you have made it a den of robbers.\u201d","And Jesus answered and *said to them
 \u201cHave faith in God.","Truly I say to you
 whoever says to this mountain
 \u2018Be taken up and thrown into the sea
\u2019 and does not doubt in his heart
 but believes that what he says is going to happen
 it will be granted to him.","Therefore
 I say to you
 all things for which you pray and ask
 believe that you have received them
 and they will be granted to you.","And whenever you stand praying
 forgive
 if you have anything against anyone
 so that your Father who is in heaven will also forgive you for your offenses.","But Jesus said to them
 \u201cI will ask you one question
 and you answer Me
 and then I will tell you by what authority I do these things.","Was the baptism of John from heaven
 or from men? Answer Me.\u201d","Answering Jesus
 they *said
 \u201cWe do not know.\u201d And Jesus *said to them
 \u201cNeither am I telling you by what authority I do these things.\u201d","And He began to speak to them in parables: \u201cA man planted a vineyard and put a fence around it
 and dug a vat under the wine press and built a tower
 and leased it to vine-growers and went on a journey.","And at the harvest time he sent a slave to the vine-growers
 in order to receive his share of the produce of the vineyard from the vine-growers.","And they took him
 and beat him
 and sent him away empty-handed.","And again he sent them another slave
 and they wounded him in the head
 and treated him shamefully.","And he sent another
 and that one they killed; and so with many others
 beating some and killing others.","He had one more man to send
 a beloved son; he sent him to them last of all
 saying
 \u2018They will respect my son.\u2019","But those vine-growers said to one another
 \u2018This is the heir; come
 let\u2019s kill him
 and the inheritance will be ours!\u2019","And they took him and killed him
 and threw him out of the vineyard.","What will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and put the vine-growers to death
 and give the vineyard to others.","Have you not even read this Scripture: \u2018A stone which the builders rejected
 This has become the chief cornerstone;","This came about from the Lord
 And it is marvelous in our eyes\u2019?\u201d","Then they *sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians to Him in order to trap Him in a statement.","Are we to pay
 or not pay?\u201d But He
 knowing their hypocrisy
 said to them
 \u201cWhy are you testing Me? Bring Me a denarius to look at.\u201d","And they brought one. And He *said to them
 \u201cWhose image and inscription is this?\u201d And they said to Him
 \u201cCaesar\u2019s.\u201d","And Jesus said to them
 \u201cPay to Caesar the things that are Caesar\u2019s
 and to God the things that are God\u2019s.\u201d And they were utterly amazed at Him.","Jesus said to them
 \u201cIs this not the reason you are mistaken
 that you do not understand the Scriptures nor the power of God?","For when they rise from the dead
 they neither marry nor are given in marriage
 but are like angels in heaven.","But regarding the fact that the dead rise
 have you not read in the book of Moses
 in the passage about the burning bush
 how God spoke to him
 saying
 \u2018I am the God of Abraham
 the God of Isaac
 and the God of Jacob\u2019?","He is not the God of the dead
 but of the living; you are greatly mistaken.\u201d","One of the scribes came up and heard them arguing
 and recognizing that He had answered them well
 asked Him
 \u201cWhat commandment is the foremost of all?\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cThe foremost is
 \u2018Hear
 Israel! The Lord is our God
 the Lord is one;","and you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart
 and with all your soul
 and with all your mind
 and with all your strength.\u2019","The second is this: \u2018You shall love your neighbor as yourself.\u2019 There is no other commandment greater than these.\u201d","When Jesus saw that he had answered intelligently
 He said to him
 \u201cYou are not far from the kingdom of God.\u201d And then
 no one dared any longer to question Him.","And Jesus responded and began saying
 as He taught in the temple area
 \u201cHow is it that the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David?","David himself said in the Holy Spirit
 \u2018The Lord said to my Lord
 \u201cSit at My right hand
 Until I put Your enemies under Your feet.\u201d\u2019","David himself calls Him \u2018Lord\u2019; so in what sense is He his son?\u201d And the large crowd enjoyed listening to Him.","And in His teaching He was saying: \u201cBeware of the scribes who like to walk around in long robes
 and like personal greetings in the marketplaces
","and seats of honor in the synagogues
 and places of honor at banquets
","who devour widows\u2019 houses
 and for appearance\u2019s sake offer long prayers. These will receive all the more condemnation.\u201d","Calling His disciples to Him
 He said to them
 \u201cTruly I say to you
 this poor widow put in more than all the contributors to the treasury;","for they all put in out of their surplus
 but she
 out of her poverty
 put in all she owned
 all she had to live on.\u201d","As He was going out of the temple
 one of His disciples *said to Him
 \u201cTeacher
 look! What wonderful stones and what wonderful buildings!\u201d","And Jesus said to him
 \u201cDo you see these great buildings? Not one stone will be left upon another
 which will not be torn down.\u201d","And Jesus began to say to them
 \u201cSee to it that no one misleads you.","Many will come in My name
 saying
 \u2018I am He!\u2019 and they will mislead many.","When you hear of wars and rumors of wars
 do not be alarmed; those things must take place; but that is not yet the end.","For nation will rise up against nation
 and kingdom against kingdom; there will be earthquakes in various places; there will also be famines. These things are only the beginning of birth pains.","\u201cBut be on your guard; for they will hand you over to the courts
 and you will be flogged in the synagogues
 and you will stand before governors and kings for My sake
 as a testimony to them.","And the gospel must first be preached to all the nations.","And when they arrest you and hand you over
 do not worry beforehand about what you are to say
 but say whatever is given you at that time; for you are not the ones speaking
 but it is the Holy Spirit.","And brother will betray brother to death
 and a father his child; and children will rise up against parents and have them put to death.","And you will be hated by everyone because of My name
 but it is the one who has endured to the end who will be saved.","\u201cNow when you see the abomination of desolation standing where it should not be\u2014let the reader understand\u2014then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains.","Whoever is on the housetop must not go down
 nor go in to get anything out of his house.","And whoever is in the field must not turn back to get his cloak.","But woe to those women who are pregnant
 and to those who are nursing babies in those days!","Moreover
 pray that it will not happen in winter.","For those days will be such a time of tribulation as has not occurred since the beginning of the creation which God created until now
 and never will again.","And if the Lord had not shortened those days
 no life would have been saved; but for the sake of the elect
 whom He chose
 He shortened the days.","And then if anyone says to you
 \u2018Look
 here is the Christ\u2019; or
 \u2018Look
 there He is\u2019; do not believe it;","for false christs and false prophets will arise
 and will provide signs and wonders
 in order to mislead
 if possible
 the elect.","But beware; I have told you everything in advance.","\u201cBut in those days
 after that tribulation
 the sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light
","and the stars will be falling from heaven
 and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken.","And then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory.","And then He will send forth the angels
 and will gather together His elect from the four winds
 from the end of the earth to the end of heaven.","\u201cNow learn the parable from the fig tree: as soon as its branch has become tender and sprouts its leaves
 you know that summer is near.","So you too
 when you see these things happening
 recognize that He is near
 right at the door.","Truly I say to you
 this generation will not pass away until all these things take place.","Heaven and earth will pass away
 but My words will not pass away.","But about that day or hour no one knows
 not even the angels in heaven
 nor the Son
 but the Father alone.","\u201cWatch out
 stay alert; for you do not know when the appointed time is.","It is like a man away on a journey
 who upon leaving his house and putting his slaves in charge
 assigning to each one his task
 also commanded the doorkeeper to stay alert.","Therefore
 stay alert\u2014for you do not know when the master of the house is coming
 whether in the evening
 at midnight
 or when the rooster crows
 or in the morning\u2014","so that he does not come suddenly and find you asleep.","What I say to you I say to all: \u2018Stay alert!\u2019\u201d","But there were some indignantly remarking to one another
 \u201cWhy has this perfume been wasted?","But Jesus said
 \u201cLeave her alone! Why are you bothering her? She has done a good deed for Me.","For you always have the poor with you
 and whenever you want
 you can do good to them; but you do not always have Me.","She has done what she could; she has anointed My body beforehand for the burial.","Truly I say to you
 wherever the gospel is preached in the entire world
 what this woman has done will also be told in memory of her.\u201d","And He *sent two of His disciples and *said to them
 \u201cGo into the city
 and a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you; follow him;","and wherever he enters
 say to the owner of the house
 \u2018The Teacher says
 \u201cWhere is My guest room in which I may eat the Passover with My disciples?\u201d\u2019","And he himself will show you a large upstairs room furnished and ready; prepare for us there.\u201d","And as they were reclining at the table and eating
 Jesus said
 \u201cTruly I say to you that one of you will betray Me\u2014one who is eating with Me.\u201d","But He said to them
 \u201cIt is one of the twelve
 the one who dips bread with Me in the bowl.","For the Son of Man is going away just as it is written about Him; but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been good for that man if he had not been born.\u201d","While they were eating
 He took some bread
 and after a blessing He broke it
 and gave it to them
 and said
 \u201cTake it; this is My body.\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cThis is My blood of the covenant
 which is being poured out for many.","Truly I say to you
 I will not drink of the fruit of the vine again
 until that day when I drink it
 new
 in the kingdom of God.\u201d","And Jesus *said to them
 \u201cYou will all fall away
 because it is written: \u2018I will strike the shepherd
 and the sheep will be scattered.\u2019","But after I am raised
 I will go ahead of you to Galilee.\u201d","And Jesus *said to him
 \u201cTruly I say to you
 that this very night
 before a rooster crows twice
 you yourself will deny Me three times.\u201d","They *came to a place named Gethsemane; and He *said to His disciples
 \u201cSit here until I have prayed.\u201d","And He *said to them
 \u201cMy soul is deeply grieved
 to the point of death; remain here and keep watch.\u201d","And He was saying
 \u201cAbba! Father! All things are possible for You; remove this cup from Me; yet not what I will
 but what You will.\u201d","And He *came and *found them sleeping
 and *said to Peter
 \u201cSimon
 are you asleep? Could you not keep watch for one hour?","Keep watching and praying
 so that you will not come into temptation; the spirit is willing
 but the flesh is weak.\u201d","And He *came the third time
 and *said to them
 \u201cAre you still sleeping and resting? That is enough. The hour has come; behold
 the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.","Get up
 let\u2019s go; behold
 the one who is betraying Me is near!\u201d","And Jesus said to them
 \u201cHave you come out with swords and clubs to arrest Me
 as you would against a man inciting a revolt?","Every day I was with you within the temple grounds teaching
 and you did not arrest Me; but this has taken place so that the Scriptures will be fulfilled.\u201d","And Jesus said
 \u201cI am; and you shall see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of power
 and coming with the clouds of heaven.\u201d","And some began to spit on Him
 and to blindfold Him
 and to beat Him with their fists and say to Him
 \u201cProphesy!\u201d Then the officers took custody of Him and slapped Him in the face.","And immediately a rooster crowed a second time. And Peter remembered how Jesus had made the remark to him
 \u201cBefore a rooster crows twice
 you will deny Me three times.\u201d And he hurried on and began to weep.","Pilate questioned Him: \u201cSo You are the King of the Jews?\u201d And He answered him
 \u201cIt is as you say.\u201d","Pilate answered them
 saying
 \u201cDo you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?\u201d","At the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice

 who was standing right in front of Him
 saw that He died in this way

 he questioned him as to whether He was already dead.","They were saying to one another
 \u201cWho will roll away the stone from the entrance of the tomb for us?\u201d","But he *said to them
 \u201cDo not be amazed; you are looking for Jesus the Nazarene

 \u201cEveryone is looking for you!\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cWe should go to other towns around here so I can preach there too. That is the reason I came.\u201d ","Jesus felt sorry for the man
 so he reached out his hand and touched him and said
 \u201cI will. Be healed!\u201d ","\u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone about this. But go and show yourself to the priest. And offer the gift Moses commanded for people who are made well. This will show the people what I have done.\u201d","When Jesus saw the faith of these people
 he said to the paralyzed man
 \u201cYoung man
 your sins are forgiven.\u201d","Jesus knew immediately what these teachers of the law were thinking. So he said to them
 \u201cWhy are you thinking these things? ","Which is easier: to tell this paralyzed man
 \u2018Your sins are forgiven
\u2019 or to tell him
 \u2018Stand up. Take your mat and walk\u2019? ","But I will prove to you that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.\u201d So Jesus said to the paralyzed man
 ","\u201cI tell you
 stand up
 take your mat

 he saw a man named Levi son of Alphaeus
 sitting in the tax collector\u2019s booth. Jesus said to him
 \u201cFollow me

 \u201cIt is not the healthy people who need a doctor

 \u201cThe friends of the bridegroom do not fast while the bridegroom is still with them. As long as the bridegroom is with them

 no one ever pours new wine into old leather bags. Otherwise
 the new wine will break the bags

 \u201cWhy are your followers doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath day?\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cHave you never read what David did when he and those with him were hungry and needed food? ","Then Jesus said to the Pharisees
 \u201cThe Sabbath day was made to help people; they were not made to be ruled by the Sabbath day. ","So then
 the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath day.\u201d","Jesus said to the man with the crippled hand
 \u201cStand up here in the middle of everyone.\u201d","Then Jesus asked the people
 \u201cWhich is lawful on the Sabbath day: to do good or to do evil

 \u201cSatan will not force himself out of people. ","A kingdom that is divided cannot continue
 ","and a family that is divided cannot continue.","And if Satan is against himself and fights against his own people
 he cannot continue; that is the end of Satan. ","No one can enter a strong person\u2019s house and steal his things unless he first ties up the strong person. Then he can steal things from the house.","I tell you the truth
 all sins that people do and all the things people say against God can be forgiven. ","But anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; he is guilty of a sin that continues forever.\u201d","Many people were sitting around Jesus
 and they said to him
 \u201cYour mother and brothers are waiting for you outside.\u201d","Jesus asked
 \u201cWho are my mother and my brothers?\u201d ","Then he looked at those sitting around him and said
 \u201cHere are my mother and my brothers! ","My true brother and sister and mother are those who do what God wants.\u201d","Jesus taught them many things
 using stories. He said
 ","\u201cListen! A farmer went out to plant his seed.","While he was planting
 some seed fell by the road
 and the birds came and ate it up. ","Some seed fell on rocky ground where there wasn\u2019t much dirt. That seed grew very fast
 because the ground was not deep. ","But when the sun rose
 the plants dried up because they did not have deep roots. ","Some other seed fell among thorny weeds
 which grew and choked the good plants. So those plants did not produce a crop. ","Some other seed fell on good ground and began to grow. It got taller and produced a crop. Some plants made thirty times more
 some made sixty times more
 and some made a hundred times more.\u201d","Then Jesus said
 \u201cLet those with ears use them and listen!\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cYou can know the secret about the kingdom of God. But to other people I tell everything by using stories ","so that: \u2018They will look and look
 but they will not learn. They will listen and listen
 but they will not understand. If they did learn and understand
 they would come back to me and be forgiven.\u2019\u201d Isaiah 6:9\u201310","Then Jesus said to his followers
 \u201cDon\u2019t you understand this story? If you don\u2019t
 how will you understand any story? ","The farmer is like a person who plants God\u2019s message in people.","Sometimes the teaching falls on the road. This is like the people who hear the teaching of God
 but Satan quickly comes and takes away the teaching that was planted in them. ","Others are like the seed planted on rocky ground. They hear the teaching and quickly accept it with joy.","But since they don\u2019t allow the teaching to go deep into their lives
 they keep it only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the teaching they accepted
 they quickly give up. ","Others are like the seed planted among the thorny weeds. They hear the teaching
 ","but the worries of this life
 the temptation of wealth
 and many other evil desires keep the teaching from growing and producing fruit in their lives. ","Others are like the seed planted in the good ground. They hear the teaching and accept it. Then they grow and produce fruit\u2014sometimes thirty times more
 sometimes sixty times more
 and sometimes a hundred times more.\u201d","Then Jesus said to them
 \u201cDo you hide a lamp under a bowl or under a bed? No! You put the lamp on a lampstand. ","Everything that is hidden will be made clear and every secret thing will be made known.","Let those with ears use them and listen!","\u201cThink carefully about what you hear. The way you give to others is the way God will give to you
 but God will give you even more. ","Those who have understanding will be given more. But those who do not have understanding
 even what they have will be taken away from them.\u201d","Then Jesus said
 \u201cThe kingdom of God is like someone who plants seed in the ground. ","Night and day
 whether the person is asleep or awake
 the seed still grows
 but the person does not know how it grows. ","By itself the earth produces grain. First the plant grows
 then the head
 and then all the grain in the head. ","When the grain is ready
 the farmer cuts it
 because this is the harvest time.\u201d","Then Jesus said
 \u201cHow can I show you what the kingdom of God is like? What story can I use to explain it? ","The kingdom of God is like a mustard seed
 the smallest seed you plant in the ground. ","But when planted
 this seed grows and becomes the largest of all garden plants. It produces large branches
 and the wild birds can make nests in its shade.\u201d","That evening
 Jesus said to his followers
 \u201cLet\u2019s go across the lake.\u201d ","Jesus stood up and commanded the wind and said to the waves
 \u201cQuiet! Be still!\u201d Then the wind stopped
 and it became completely calm.","Jesus said to his followers
 \u201cWhy are you afraid? Do you still have no faith?\u201d","He said this because Jesus was saying to him
 \u201cYou evil spirit
 come out of the man.\u201d","Then Jesus asked him
 \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d He answered
 \u201cMy name is Legion
 because we are many spirits.\u201d ","But Jesus would not let him. He said
 \u201cGo home to your family and tell them how much the Lord has done for you and how he has had mercy on you.\u201d ","She thought
 \u201cIf I can just touch his clothes
 I will be healed.\u201d ","His followers said
 \u201cLook at how many people are pushing against you! And you ask
 \u2018Who touched me?\u2019 \u201d","Jesus said to her
 \u201cDear woman
 you are made well because you believed. Go in peace; be healed of your disease.\u201d","But Jesus paid no attention to what they said. He told the synagogue leader
 \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid; just believe.\u201d","Jesus entered the house and said to them
 \u201cWhy are you crying and making so much noise? The child is not dead
 only asleep.\u201d ","Taking hold of the girl\u2019s hand
 he said to her
 \u201cTalitha

 \u201cA prophet is honored everywhere except in his hometown and with his own people and in his own home.\u201d ","He called his twelve followers together and got ready to send them out two by two and gave them authority over evil spirits.","When you enter a house
 stay there until you leave that town. ","If the people in a certain place refuse to welcome you or listen to you
 leave that place. Shake its dust off your feet as a warning to them.\u201d","When Herod heard this
 he said
 \u201cI killed John by cutting off his head. Now he has risen from the dead!\u201d","When the daughter of Herodias came in and danced
 she pleased Herod and the people eating with him. So King Herod said to the girl
 \u201cAsk me for anything you want
 and I will give it to you.\u201d ","The girl went to her mother and asked
 \u201cWhat should I ask for?\u201d Her mother answered
 \u201cAsk for the head of John the Baptist.\u201d","Crowds of people were coming and going so that Jesus and his followers did not even have time to eat. He said to them
 \u201cCome away by yourselves
 and we will go to a lonely place to get some rest.\u201d","But Jesus answered
 \u201cYou give them something to eat.\u201d They said to him
 \u201cWe would all have to work a month to earn enough money to buy that much bread!\u201d","Jesus asked them
 \u201cHow many loaves of bread do you have? Go and see.\u201d When they found out
 they said
 \u201cFive loaves and two fish.\u201d","They all saw him and were afraid. But quickly Jesus spoke to them and said
 \u201cHave courage! It is I. Do not be afraid.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cIsaiah was right when he spoke about you hypocrites. He wrote
 \u2018These people show honor to me with words
 but their hearts are far from me.","Their worship of me is worthless. The things they teach are nothing but human rules.\u2019 Isaiah 29:13","You have stopped following the commands of God
 and you follow only human teachings.\u201d","Then Jesus said to them
 \u201cYou cleverly ignore the commands of God so you can follow your own teachings. ","Moses said
 \u2018Honor your father and your mother
\u2019 and \u2018Anyone who says cruel things to his father or mother must be put to death.\u2019 ","But you say a person can tell his father or mother
 \u2018I have something I could use to help you
 but it is Corban\u2014a gift to God.\u2019 ","You no longer let that person use that money for his father or his mother.","By your own rules
 which you teach people
 you are rejecting what God said. And you do many things like that.\u201d","After Jesus called the crowd to him again
 he said
 \u201cEvery person should listen to me and understand what I am saying. ","There is nothing people put into their bodies that makes them unclean. People are made unclean by the things that come out of them. [","Jesus said
 \u201cDo you still not understand? Surely you know that nothing that enters someone from the outside can make that person unclean. ","It does not go into the mind
 but into the stomach. Then it goes out of the body.\u201d (When Jesus said this
 he meant that no longer was any food unclean for people to eat.)","And Jesus said
 \u201cThe things that come out of people are the things that make them unclean. ","All these evil things begin inside people
 in the mind: evil thoughts
 sexual sins
 stealing
 murder
 adultery
 ","greed
 evil actions
 lying
 doing sinful things
 jealousy
 speaking evil of others
 pride
 and foolish living. ","All these evil things come from inside and make people unclean.\u201d","Jesus told the woman
 \u201cIt is not right to take the children\u2019s bread and give it to the dogs. First let the children eat all they want.\u201d","Then Jesus said
 \u201cBecause of your answer
 you may go. The demon has left your daughter.\u201d","Looking up to heaven
 he sighed and said to the man
 \u201cEphphatha!\u201d (This means
 \u201cBe opened.\u201d) ","Another time there was a great crowd with Jesus that had nothing to eat. So Jesus called his followers and said
 ","\u201cI feel sorry for these people
 because they have already been with me for three days
 and they have nothing to eat. ","If I send them home hungry
 they will faint on the way. Some of them live a long way from here.\u201d","Jesus asked
 \u201cHow many loaves of bread do you have?\u201d They answered
 \u201cSeven.\u201d","Jesus sighed deeply and said
 \u201cWhy do you people ask for a miracle as a sign? I tell you the truth
 no sign will be given to you.\u201d ","Jesus warned them
 \u201cBe careful! Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod.\u201d","Knowing what they were talking about
 Jesus asked them
 \u201cWhy are you talking about not having bread? Do you still not see or understand? Are your minds closed? ","You have eyes
 but you don\u2019t really see. You have ears
 but you don\u2019t really listen. Remember when ","I divided five loaves of bread for the five thousand? How many baskets did you fill with leftover pieces of food?\u201d They answered
 \u201cTwelve.\u201d","\u201cAnd when I divided seven loaves of bread for the four thousand
 how many baskets did you fill with leftover pieces of food?\u201d They answered
 \u201cSeven.\u201d","Then Jesus said to them
 \u201cDon\u2019t you understand yet?\u201d","So Jesus took the blind man\u2019s hand and led him out of the village. Then he spit on the man\u2019s eyes and put his hands on the man and asked
 \u201cCan you see now?\u201d","Jesus told him to go home
 saying
 \u201cDon\u2019t go into the town.\u201d","Jesus and his followers went to the towns around Caesarea Philippi. While they were traveling
 Jesus asked them
 \u201cWho do people say I am?\u201d","Then Jesus asked
 \u201cBut who do you say I am?\u201d Peter answered
 \u201cYou are the Christ.\u201d","But Jesus turned and looked at his followers. Then he told Peter not to talk that way. He said
 \u201cGo away from me
 Satan! You don\u2019t care about the things of God
 but only about things people think are important.\u201d","Then Jesus called the crowd to him
 along with his followers. He said
 \u201cIf people want to follow me
 they must give up the things they want. They must be willing even to give up their lives to follow me. ","Those who want to save their lives will give up true life. But those who give up their lives for me and for the Good News will have true life.","It is worthless to have the whole world if they lose their souls.","They could never pay enough to buy back their souls.","The people who live now are living in a sinful and evil time.

 the Son of Man will be ashamed of them when he comes with his Father\u2019s glory and with the holy angels.\u201d","Then Jesus said to the people
 \u201cI tell you the truth
 some people standing here will see the kingdom of God come with power before they die.\u201d","Peter said to Jesus
 \u201cTeacher
 it is good that we are here. Let us make three tents\u2014one for you
 one for Moses
 and one for Elijah.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cThey are right to say that Elijah must come first and make everything the way it should be.

And people did to him whatever they wanted to do
 just as the Scriptures said it would happen.\u201d","Jesus asked
 \u201cWhat are you arguing about?\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cYou people have no faith. How long must I stay with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring the boy to me.\u201d","Jesus asked the boy\u2019s father
 \u201cHow long has this been happening?\u201d The father answered
 \u201cSince he was very young. ","Jesus said to the father
 \u201cYou said
 \u2018If you can!\u2019 All things are possible for the one who believes.\u201d","When Jesus saw that a crowd was quickly gathering
 he ordered the evil spirit
 saying
 \u201cYou spirit that makes people unable to hear or speak
 I command you to come out of this boy and never enter him again!\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cThat kind of spirit can only be forced out by prayer.\u201d","because he was teaching his followers. He said to them
 \u201cThe Son of Man will be handed over to people

 he will rise from the dead.\u201d ","Jesus and his followers went to Capernaum. When they went into a house there
 he asked them
 \u201cWhat were you arguing about on the road?\u201d ","Jesus sat down and called the twelve apostles to him. He said
 \u201cWhoever wants to be the most important must be last of all and servant of all.\u201d","Then Jesus took a small child and had him stand among them. Taking the child in his arms
 he said
 ","But Jesus said
 \u201cDon\u2019t stop him
 because anyone who uses my name to do powerful things will not easily say evil things about me. ","Whoever is not against us is with us.","I tell you the truth

 take it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with only one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell. ","In hell the worm does not die; the fire is never put out.","Every person will be salted with fire.","\u201cSalt is good
 but if the salt loses its salty taste
 you cannot make it salty again. So
 be full of salt

 \u201cWhat did Moses command you to do?\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cMoses wrote that command for you because you were stubborn. ","But when God made the world
 \u2018he made them male and female.\u2019 ","\u2018So a man will leave his father and mother and be united with his wife

 but one. ","God has joined the two together

 \u201cAnyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman is guilty of adultery against her. ","And the woman who divorces her husband and marries another man is also guilty of adultery.\u201d","When Jesus saw this
 he was upset and said to them
 \u201cLet the little children come to me. Don\u2019t stop them

 \u201cWhy do you call me good? Only God is good. ","You know the commands: \u2018You must not murder anyone. You must not be guilty of adultery. You must not steal. You must not tell lies about your neighbor. You must not cheat. Honor your father and mother.\u2019\u201d","The man said
 \u201cTeacher

 \u201cHow hard it will be for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!\u201d","The followers were amazed at what Jesus said. But he said again
 \u201cMy children

 \u201cThe other nations have rulers. You know that those rulers love to show their power over the people

 the Son of Man did not come to be served. He came to serve others and to give his life as a ransom for many people.\u201d","Jesus stopped and said

 \u201cA man planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it and dug a hole for a winepress and built a tower. Then he leased the land to some farmers and left for a trip. ","When it was time for the grapes to be picked
 he sent a servant to the farmers to get his share of the grapes. ","But the farmers grabbed the servant and beat him and sent him away empty-handed.","Then the man sent another servant. They hit him on the head and showed no respect for him.","So the man sent another servant
 whom they killed. The man sent many other servants; the farmers beat some of them and killed others.","\u201cThe man had one person left to send
 his son whom he loved. He sent him last of all

 it will be ours.\u2019 ","So they took the son

 the Good News must be told to all people. ","When you are arrested and judged

 no one would go on living. But God will make that time short to help the people he has chosen. ","At that time
 someone might say to you

 there is the Christ!\u2019 Or another person might say
 \u2018There he is!\u2019 But don\u2019t believe them. ","False Christs and false prophets will come and perform great wonders and miracles. They will try to fool even the people God has chosen

 \u201cHere is what God\u2019s kingdom is like. A farmer scatters seed on the ground. ","Night and day the seed comes up and grows. It happens whether the farmer sleeps or gets up.

 \u201cWhat can we say God\u2019s kingdom is like? What story can we use to explain it? ","It is like a mustard seed

 it grows. It becomes the largest of all garden plants. Its branches are so big that birds can rest in its shade.\u201d","When evening came
 Jesus said to his disciples

 but sinners.\u2019","Jesus answered
 \u2018How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them? They cannot
 so long as they have him with them. ","But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them
 and on that day they will fast.","\u2018No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. Otherwise
 the new piece will pull away from the old
 making the tear worse. ","And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise
 the wine will burst the skins
 and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined. No
 they pour new wine into new wineskins.\u2019","The Pharisees said to him
 \u2018Look
 why are they doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?\u2019","He answered
 \u2018Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need? ","Then he said to them
 \u2018The Sabbath was made for man
 not man for the Sabbath. ","So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.\u2019","Jesus said to the man with the shrivelled hand
 \u2018Stand up in front of everyone.\u2019","Then Jesus asked them
 \u2018Which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil
 to save life or to kill?\u2019 But they remained silent.","He looked around at them in anger and
 deeply distressed at their stubborn hearts
 said to the man
 \u2018Stretch out your hand.\u2019 He stretched it out
 and his hand was completely restored. ","So Jesus called them over to him and began to speak to them in parables: \u2018How can Satan drive out Satan?","If a kingdom is divided against itself
 that kingdom cannot stand. ","If a house is divided against itself
 that house cannot stand. ","And if Satan opposes himself and is divided
 he cannot stand; his end has come. ","In fact
 no one can enter a strong man\u2019s house without first tying him up. Then he can plunder the strong man\u2019s house. ","Truly I tell you
 people can be forgiven all their sins and every slander they utter
 ","but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; they are guilty of an eternal sin.\u2019","A crowd was sitting round him
 and they told him
 \u2018Your mother and brothers are outside looking for you.\u2019","\u2018Who are my mother and my brothers?\u2019 he asked.","Then he looked at those seated in a circle round him and said
 \u2018Here are my mother and my brothers! ","Whoever does God\u2019s will is my brother and sister and mother.\u2019","He taught them many things by parables
 and in his teaching said: ","\u2018Listen! A farmer went out to sow his seed.","As he was scattering the seed
 some fell along the path
 and the birds came and ate it up. ","Some fell on rocky places
 where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly
 because the soil was shallow. ","But when the sun came up
 the plants were scorched
 and they withered because they had no root. ","Other seed fell among thorns
 which grew up and choked the plants
 so that they did not bear grain. ","Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up
 grew and produced a crop
 some multiplying thirty
 some sixty
 some a hundred times.\u2019","Then Jesus said
 \u2018Whoever has ears to hear
 let them hear.\u2019","He told them
 \u2018The secret of the kingdom of God has been given to you. But to those on the outside everything is said in parables ","so that
 \u2018\u201cthey may be ever seeing but never perceiving
 and ever hearing but never understanding; otherwise they might turn and be forgiven!\u201d\u2019","Then Jesus said to them
 \u2018Don\u2019t you understand this parable? How then will you understand any parable? ","The farmer sows the word.","Some people are like seed along the path
 where the word is sown. As soon as they hear it
 Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them. ","Others
 like seed sown on rocky places
 hear the word and at once receive it with joy. ","But since they have no root
 they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word
 they quickly fall away. ","Still others
 like seed sown among thorns
 hear the word; ","but the worries of this life
 the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things come in and choke the word
 making it unfruitful. ","Others
 like seed sown on good soil
 hear the word
 accept it
 and produce a crop \u2013 some thirty
 some sixty
 some a hundred times what was sown.\u2019","He said to them
 \u2018Do you bring in a lamp to put it under a bowl or a bed? Instead
 don\u2019t you put it on its stand? ","For whatever is hidden is meant to be disclosed
 and whatever is concealed is meant to be brought out into the open. ","If anyone has ears to hear
 let them hear.\u2019","\u2018Consider carefully what you hear
\u2019 he continued. \u2018With the measure you use
 it will be measured to you \u2013 and even more. ","Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have
 even what they have will be taken from them.\u2019","He also said
 \u2018This is what the kingdom of God is like. A man scatters seed on the ground. ","Night and day
 whether he sleeps or gets up
 the seed sprouts and grows
 though he does not know how. ","All by itself the soil produces corn \u2013 first the stalk
 then the ear
 then the full grain in the ear. ","As soon as the corn is ripe
 he puts the sickle to it
 because the harvest has come.\u2019","Again he said
 \u2018What shall we say the kingdom of God is like
 or what parable shall we use to describe it? ","It is like a mustard seed
 which is the smallest of all seeds on earth. ","Yet when planted
 it grows and becomes the largest of all garden plants
 with such big branches that the birds can perch in its shade.\u2019","That day when evening came
 he said to his disciples
 \u2018Let us go over to the other side.\u2019 ","He got up
 rebuked the wind and said to the waves
 \u2018Quiet! Be still!\u2019 Then the wind died down and it was completely calm.","He said to his disciples
 \u2018Why are you so afraid? Do you still have no faith?\u2019","For Jesus had said to him
 \u2018Come out of this man
 you impure spirit!\u2019","Then Jesus asked him
 \u2018What is your name?\u2019 \u2018My name is Legion
\u2019 he replied
 \u2018for we are many.\u2019 ","Jesus did not let him
 but said
 \u2018Go home to your own people and tell them how much the Lord has done for you
 and how he has had mercy on you.\u2019 ","because she thought
 \u2018If I just touch his clothes
 I will be healed.\u2019 ","\u2018You see the people crowding against you
\u2019 his disciples answered
 \u2018and yet you can ask
 \u201cWho touched me?\u201d\u2019","He said to her
 \u2018Daughter
 your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be freed from your suffering.\u2019","Overhearing what they said
 Jesus told him
 \u2018Don\u2019t be afraid; just believe.\u2019","He went in and said to them
 \u2018Why all this commotion and wailing? The child is not dead but asleep.\u2019 ","He took her by the hand and said to her
 \u2018Talitha koum!\u2019 (which means \u2018Little girl
 I say to you
 get up!\u2019). ","Jesus said to them
 \u2018A prophet is not without honour except in his own town
 among his relatives and in his own home.\u2019 ","Calling the Twelve to him
 he began to send them out two by two and gave them authority over impure spirits.","Whenever you enter a house
 stay there until you leave that town. ","And if any place will not welcome you or listen to you
 leave that place and shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them.\u2019","But when Herod heard this
 he said
 \u2018John
 whom I beheaded
 has been raised from the dead!\u2019","When the daughter of Herodias came in and danced
 she pleased Herod and his dinner guests. The king said to the girl
 \u2018Ask me for anything you want
 and I\u2019ll give it to you.\u2019 ","She went out and said to her mother
 \u2018What shall I ask for?\u2019 \u2018The head of John the Baptist
\u2019 she answered.","Then
 because so many people were coming and going that they did not even have a chance to eat
 he said to them
 \u2018Come with me by yourselves to a quiet place and get some rest.\u2019","But he answered
 \u2018You give them something to eat.\u2019 They said to him
 \u2018That would take more than half a year\u2019s wages! Are we to go and spend that much on bread and give it to them to eat?\u2019","\u2018How many loaves do you have?\u2019 he asked. \u2018Go and see.\u2019 When they found out
 they said
 \u2018Five \u2013 and two fish.\u2019","because they all saw him and were terrified. Immediately he spoke to them and said
 \u2018Take courage! It is I. Don\u2019t be afraid.\u2019 ","He replied
 \u2018Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites; as it is written: \u2018\u201cThese people honour me with their lips
 but their hearts are far from me.","They worship me in vain; their teachings are merely human rules.\u201d","You have let go of the commands of God and are holding on to human traditions.\u2019","And he continued
 \u2018You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in order to observe your own traditions! ","For Moses said
 \u201cHonour your father and mother
\u201d and
 \u201cAnyone who curses their father or mother is to be put to death.\u201d ","But you say that if anyone declares that what might have been used to help their father or mother is Corban (that is
 devoted to God) \u2013  ","then you no longer let them do anything for their father or mother.","Thus you nullify the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And you do many things like that.\u2019","Again Jesus called the crowd to him and said
 \u2018Listen to me
 everyone
 and understand this. ","Nothing outside a person can defile them by going into them. Rather
 it is what comes out of a person that defiles them.\u2019  ","\u2018Are you so dull?\u2019 he asked. \u2018Don\u2019t you see that nothing that enters a person from the outside can defile them?","For it doesn\u2019t go into their heart but into their stomach
 and then out of the body.\u2019 (In saying this
 Jesus declared all foods clean.)","He went on: \u2018What comes out of a person is what defiles them.","For it is from within
 out of a person\u2019s heart
 that evil thoughts come \u2013 sexual immorality
 theft
 murder
 ","adultery
 greed
 malice
 deceit
 lewdness
 envy
 slander
 arrogance and folly. ","All these evils come from inside and defile a person.\u2019","\u2018First let the children eat all they want
\u2019 he told her
 \u2018for it is not right to take the children\u2019s bread and toss it to the dogs.\u2019","Then he told her
 \u2018For such a reply
 you may go; the demon has left your daughter.\u2019","He looked up to heaven and with a deep sigh said to him
 \u2018Ephphatha!\u2019 (which means \u2018Be opened!\u2019). ","During those days another large crowd gathered. Since they had nothing to eat
 Jesus called his disciples to him and said
 ","\u2018I have compassion for these people; they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat.","If I send them home hungry
 they will collapse on the way
 because some of them have come a long distance.\u2019","\u2018How many loaves do you have?\u2019 Jesus asked. \u2018Seven
\u2019 they replied.","He sighed deeply and said
 \u2018Why does this generation ask for a sign? Truly I tell you
 no sign will be given to it.\u2019 ","\u2018Be careful
\u2019 Jesus warned them. \u2018Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and that of Herod.\u2019","Aware of their discussion
 Jesus asked them: \u2018Why are you talking about having no bread? Do you still not see or understand? Are your hearts hardened? ","Do you have eyes but fail to see
 and ears but fail to hear? And don\u2019t you remember? ","When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand
 how many basketfuls of pieces did you pick up?\u2019 \u2018Twelve
\u2019 they replied.","\u2018And when I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand
 how many basketfuls of pieces did you pick up?\u2019 They answered
 \u2018Seven.\u2019","He said to them
 \u2018Do you still not understand?\u2019","He took the blind man by the hand and led him outside the village. When he had spat on the man\u2019s eyes and put his hands on him
 Jesus asked
 \u2018Do you see anything?\u2019","Jesus sent him home
 saying
 \u2018Don\u2019t even go into the village.\u2019","Jesus and his disciples went on to the villages around Caesarea Philippi. On the way he asked them
 \u2018Who do people say I am?\u2019","\u2018But what about you?\u2019 he asked. \u2018Who do you say I am?\u2019 Peter answered
 \u2018You are the Messiah.\u2019","But when Jesus turned and looked at his disciples
 he rebuked Peter. \u2018Get behind me
 Satan!\u2019 he said. \u2018You do not have in mind the concerns of God
 but merely human concerns.\u2019","Then he called the crowd to him along with his disciples and said: \u2018Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me.","For whoever wants to save their life will lose it
 but whoever loses their life for me and for the gospel will save it. ","What good is it for someone to gain the whole world
 yet forfeit their soul? ","Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul?","If anyone is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation
 the Son of Man will be ashamed of them when he comes in his Father\u2019s glory with the holy angels.\u2019","And he said to them
 \u2018Truly I tell you
 some who are standing here will not taste death before they see that the kingdom of God has come with power.\u2019","Peter said to Jesus
 \u2018Rabbi
 it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters \u2013 one for you
 one for Moses and one for Elijah.\u2019 ","Jesus replied
 \u2018To be sure
 Elijah does come first
 and restores all things. Why then is it written that the Son of Man must suffer much and be rejected? ","But I tell you
 Elijah has come
 and they have done to him everything they wished
 just as it is written about him.\u2019","\u2018What are you arguing with them about?\u2019 he asked.","\u2018You unbelieving generation
\u2019 Jesus replied
 \u2018how long shall I stay with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring the boy to me.\u2019","Jesus asked the boy\u2019s father
 \u2018How long has he been like this?\u2019 \u2018From childhood
\u2019 he answered. ","\u2018\u201cIf you can\u201d?\u2019 said Jesus. \u2018Everything is possible for one who believes.\u2019","When Jesus saw that a crowd was running to the scene
 he rebuked the impure spirit. \u2018You deaf and mute spirit
\u2019 he said
 \u2018I command you
 come out of him and never enter him again.\u2019","He replied
 \u2018This kind can come out only by prayer.\u2019","because he was teaching his disciples. He said to them
 \u2018The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men. They will kill him
 and after three days he will rise.\u2019 ","They came to Capernaum. When he was in the house
 he asked them
 \u2018What were you arguing about on the road?\u2019 ","Sitting down
 Jesus called the Twelve and said
 \u2018Anyone who wants to be first must be the very last
 and the servant of all.\u2019","He took a little child whom he placed among them. Taking the child in his arms
 he said to them
 ","\u2018Do not stop him
\u2019 Jesus said. \u2018For no one who does a miracle in my name can in the next moment say anything bad about me
 ","for whoever is not against us is for us.","Truly I tell you
 anyone who gives you a cup of water in my name because you belong to the Messiah will certainly not lose their reward.","\u2018If anyone causes one of these little ones \u2013 those who believe in me \u2013 to stumble
 it would be better for them if a large millstone were hung round their neck and they were thrown into the sea. ","If your hand causes you to stumble
 cut it off. It is better for you to enter life maimed than with two hands to go into hell
 where the fire never goes out.   ","And if your foot causes you to stumble
 cut it off. It is better for you to enter life crippled than to have two feet and be thrown into hell.   ","And if your eye causes you to stumble
 pluck it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell
 ","where \u2018\u201cthe worms that eat them do not die
 and the fire is not quenched.\u201d","Everyone will be salted with fire.","\u2018Salt is good
 but if it loses its saltiness
 how can you make it salty again? Have salt among yourselves
 and be at peace with each other.\u2019","\u2018What did Moses command you?\u2019 he replied.","\u2018It was because your hearts were hard that Moses wrote you this law
\u2019 Jesus replied. ","\u2018But at the beginning of creation God \u201cmade them male and female\u201d.","\u201cFor this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife
 ","and the two will become one flesh.\u201d So they are no longer two
 but one flesh. ","Therefore what God has joined together
 let no one separate.\u2019","He answered
 \u2018Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her. ","And if she divorces her husband and marries another man
 she commits adultery.\u2019","When Jesus saw this
 he was indignant. He said to them
 \u2018Let the little children come to me
 and do not hinder them

 anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.\u2019 ","\u2018Why do you call me good?\u2019 Jesus answered. \u2018No one is good \u2013 except God alone.","You know the commandments: \u201cYou shall not murder

 sell everything you have and give to the poor

 \u2018How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!\u2019","The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said again
 \u2018Children

 \u2018You will drink the cup I drink and be baptised with the baptism I am baptised with
 ","but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant. These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared.\u2019","Jesus called them together and said
 \u2018You know that those who are regarded as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them

 dug a pit for the winepress and built a watchtower. Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and moved to another place. ","At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants to collect from them some of the fruit of the vineyard.","But they seized him
 beat him and sent him away empty-handed. ","Then he sent another servant to them; they struck this man on the head and treated him shamefully.","He sent still another
 and that one they killed. He sent many others; some of them they beat

 a son
 whom he loved. He sent him last of all

 \u201cThey will respect my son.\u201d","\u2018But the tenants said to one another
 \u201cThis is the heir. Come
 let\u2019s kill him
 and the inheritance will be ours.\u201d ","So they took him and killed him
 and threw him out of the vineyard.","\u2018What then will the owner of the vineyard do?

 he said to him
 \u2018You are not far from the kingdom of God.\u2019 And from then on no one dared ask him any more questions.","While Jesus was teaching in the temple courts

 \u2018Why do the teachers of the law say that the Messiah is the son of David? ","David himself

 \u2018Watch out for the teachers of the law. They like to walk around in flowing robes and be greeted with respect in the market-places
 ","and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honour at banquets.","They devour widows\u2019 houses and for a show make lengthy prayers. These men will be punished most severely.\u2019","Calling his disciples to him
 Jesus said
 \u2018Truly I tell you
 this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others. ","They all gave out of their wealth; but she
 out of her poverty
 put in everything \u2013 all she had to live on.\u2019","As Jesus was leaving the temple
 one of his disciples said to him
 \u2018Look
 Teacher! What massive stones! What magnificent buildings!\u2019","\u2018Do you see all these great buildings?\u2019 replied Jesus. \u2018Not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down.\u2019","Jesus said to them: \u2018Watch out that no one deceives you.","Many will come in my name
 claiming
 \u201cI am he
\u201d and will deceive many. ","When you hear of wars and rumours of wars
 do not be alarmed. Such things must happen
 but the end is still to come. ","Nation will rise against nation
 and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places
 and famines. These are the beginning of birth-pains.","\u2018You must be on your guard. You will be handed over to the local councils and flogged in the synagogues. On account of me you will stand before governors and kings as witnesses to them.","And the gospel must first be preached to all nations.","Whenever you are arrested and brought to trial
 do not worry beforehand about what to say. Just say whatever is given you at the time
 for it is not you speaking
 but the Holy Spirit.","\u2018Brother will betray brother to death
 and a father his child. Children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death. ","Everyone will hate you because of me
 but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved.","\u2018When you see \u201cthe abomination that causes desolation\u201d standing where it does not belong \u2013 let the reader understand \u2013 then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.","Let no one on the housetop go down or enter the house to take anything out.","Let no one in the field go back to get their cloak.","How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers!","Pray that this will not take place in winter
 ","because those will be days of distress unequalled from the beginning
 when God created the world
 until now \u2013 and never to be equalled again.","\u2018If the Lord had not cut short those days
 no one would survive. But for the sake of the elect
 whom he has chosen
 he has shortened them. ","At that time if anyone says to you
 \u201cLook
 here is the Messiah!\u201d or
 \u201cLook
 there he is!\u201d do not believe it. ","For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform signs and wonders to deceive
 if possible
 even the elect. ","So be on your guard; I have told you everything in advance.","\u2018But in those days
 following that distress
 \u2018\u201cthe sun will be darkened
 and the moon will not give its light;","the stars will fall from the sky
 and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.\u201d","\u2018At that time people will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory.","And he will send his angels and gather his elect from the four winds
 from the ends of the earth to the ends of the heavens.","\u2018Now learn this lesson from the fig-tree: as soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out
 you know that summer is near. ","Even so
 when you see these things happening
 you know that it is near
 right at the door. ","Truly I tell you
 this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened. ","Heaven and earth will pass away
 but my words will never pass away.","\u2018But about that day or hour no one knows
 not even the angels in heaven
 nor the Son
 but only the Father. ","Be on guard! Be alert! You do not know when that time will come.","It\u2019s like a man going away: he leaves his house and puts his servants in charge
 each with their assigned task
 and tells the one at the door to keep watch.","\u2018Therefore keep watch because you do not know when the owner of the house will come back \u2013 whether in the evening
 or at midnight
 or when the cock crows
 or at dawn. ","If he comes suddenly
 do not let him find you sleeping. ","What I say to you
 I say to everyone: \u201cWatch!\u201d\u2019","Some of those present were saying indignantly to one another
 \u2018Why this waste of perfume? ","\u2018Leave her alone
\u2019 said Jesus. \u2018Why are you bothering her? She has done a beautiful thing to me. ","The poor you will always have with you
 and you can help them any time you want. But you will not always have me. ","She did what she could. She poured perfume on my body beforehand to prepare for my burial.","Truly I tell you
 wherever the gospel is preached throughout the world
 what she has done will also be told
 in memory of her.\u2019","So he sent two of his disciples
 telling them
 \u2018Go into the city
 and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him. ","Say to the owner of the house he enters
 \u201cThe Teacher asks: where is my guest room
 where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?\u201d ","He will show you a large room upstairs
 furnished and ready. Make preparations for us there.\u2019","While they were reclining at the table eating
 he said
 \u2018Truly I tell you
 one of you will betray me \u2013 one who is eating with me.\u2019","\u2018It is one of the Twelve
\u2019 he replied
 \u2018one who dips bread into the bowl with me. ","The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born.\u2019","While they were eating
 Jesus took bread
 and when he had given thanks
 he broke it and gave it to his disciples
 saying
 \u2018Take it; this is my body.\u2019","\u2018This is my blood of the covenant
 which is poured out for many
\u2019 he said to them. ","\u2018Truly I tell you
 I will not drink again from the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.\u2019","\u2018You will all fall away
\u2019 Jesus told them
 \u2018for it is written: \u2018\u201cI will strike the shepherd
 and the sheep will be scattered.\u201d","But after I have risen
 I will go ahead of you into Galilee.\u2019","\u2018Truly I tell you
\u2019 Jesus answered
 \u2018today \u2013 yes
 tonight \u2013 before the cock crows twice you yourself will disown me three times.\u2019","They went to a place called Gethsemane
 and Jesus said to his disciples
 \u2018Sit here while I pray.\u2019 ","\u2018My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death
\u2019 he said to them. \u2018Stay here and keep watch.\u2019","\u2018Abba
 Father
\u2019 he said
 \u2018everything is possible for you. Take this cup from me. Yet not what I will
 but what you will.\u2019","Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. \u2018Simon
\u2019 he said to Peter
 \u2018are you asleep? Couldn\u2019t you keep watch for one hour? ","Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing
 but the flesh is weak.\u2019","Returning the third time
 he said to them
 \u2018Are you still sleeping and resting? Enough! The hour has come. Look
 the Son of Man is delivered into the hands of sinners. ","Rise! Let us go! Here comes my betrayer!\u2019","\u2018Am I leading a rebellion
\u2019 said Jesus
 \u2018that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me? ","Every day I was with you
 teaching in the temple courts
 and you did not arrest me. But the Scriptures must be fulfilled.\u2019 ","\u2018I am
\u2019 said Jesus. \u2018And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.\u2019","Then some began to spit at him; they blindfolded him
 struck him with their fists
 and said
 \u2018Prophesy!\u2019 And the guards took him and beat him.","Immediately the cock crowed the second time. Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken to him: \u2018Before the cock crows twice you will disown me three times.\u2019 And he broke down and wept.","\u2018Are you the king of the Jews?\u2019 asked Pilate. \u2018You have said so
\u2019 Jesus replied.","\u2018Do you want me to release to you the king of the Jews?\u2019 asked Pilate
 ","And at three in the afternoon Jesus cried out in a loud voice
 \u2018Eloi
 Eloi
 lema sabachthani?\u2019 (which means \u2018My God
 my God
 why have you forsaken me?\u2019).","And when the centurion
 who stood there in front of Jesus
 saw how he died
 he said
 \u2018Surely this man was the Son of God!\u2019","Pilate was surprised to hear that he was already dead. Summoning the centurion
 he asked him if Jesus had already died. ","and they asked each other
 \u2018Who will roll the stone away from the entrance of the tomb?\u2019","\u2018Don\u2019t be alarmed
\u2019 he said. \u2018You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene
 who was crucified. He has risen! He is not here. See the place where they laid him. ","He said to them
 \u2018Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation. ","Whoever believes and is baptised will be saved
 but whoever does not believe will be condemned. ","And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues;","they will pick up snakes with their hands; and when they drink deadly poison
 it will not hurt them at all; they will place their hands on people who are ill
 and they will get well.\u2019","The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ
 the Son of God. ","and saying
 \u201cThe time is fulfilled
 and the kingdom of God is at hand. Repent
 and believe in the gospel.\u201d","Then Jesus said to them
 \u201cFollow Me
 and I will make you become fishers of men.\u201d ","But Jesus rebuked him
 saying
 \u201cBe quiet
 and come out of him!\u201d ","When they found Him
 they said to Him
 \u201cEveryone is looking for You.\u201d","But He said to them
 \u201cLet us go into the next towns
 that I may preach there also
 because for this purpose I have come forth.\u201d","Then Jesus
 moved with compassion
 stretched out His hand and touched him
 and said to him
 \u201cI am willing; be cleansed.\u201d ","and said to him
 \u201cSee that you say nothing to anyone; but go your way
 show yourself to the priest
 and offer for your cleansing those things which Moses commanded
 as a testimony to them.\u201d","When Jesus saw their faith
 He said to the paralytic
 \u201cSon
 your sins are forgiven you.\u201d","But immediately
 when Jesus perceived in His spirit that they reasoned thus within themselves
 He said to them
 \u201cWhy do you reason about these things in your hearts? ","Which is easier
 to say to the paralytic
 \u2018Your sins are forgiven you
\u2019 or to say
 \u2018Arise
 take up your bed and walk\u2019? ","But that you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins\u201d\u2014He said to the paralytic
 ","\u201cI say to you
 arise
 take up your bed
 and go to your house.\u201d ","As He passed by
 He saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax office. And He said to him
 \u201cFollow Me.\u201d So he arose and followed Him.","When Jesus heard it
 He said to them
 \u201cThose who are well have no need of a physician
 but those who are sick. I did not come to call the righteous
 but sinners
 to repentance.\u201d","And Jesus said to them
 \u201cCan the friends of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast. ","But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them
 and then they will fast in those days. ","No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; or else the new piece pulls away from the old
 and the tear is made worse. ","And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; or else the new wine bursts the wineskins
 the wine is spilled
 and the wineskins are ruined. But new wine must be put into new wineskins.\u201d","And the Pharisees said to Him
 \u201cLook
 why do they do what is not lawful on the Sabbath?\u201d","But He said to them
 \u201cHave you never read what David did when he was in need and hungry
 he and those with him: ","And He said to them
 \u201cThe Sabbath was made for man
 and not man for the Sabbath. ","Therefore the Son of Man is also Lord of the Sabbath.\u201d","And He said to the man who had the withered hand
 \u201cStep forward.\u201d ","Then He said to them
 \u201cIs it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil
 to save life or to kill?\u201d But they kept silent. ","And when He had looked around at them with anger
 being grieved by the hardness of their hearts
 He said to the man
 \u201cStretch out your hand.\u201d And he stretched it out
 and his hand was restored as whole as the other. ","So He called them to Himself and said to them in parables: \u201cHow can Satan cast out Satan?","If a kingdom is divided against itself
 that kingdom cannot stand. ","And if a house is divided against itself
 that house cannot stand. ","And if Satan has risen up against himself
 and is divided
 he cannot stand
 but has an end. ","No one can enter a strong man\u2019s house and plunder his goods
 unless he first binds the strong man. And then he will plunder his house. The Unpardonable Sin","\u201cAssuredly
 I say to you
 all sins will be forgiven the sons of men
 and whatever blasphemies they may utter; ","but he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness
 but is subject to eternal condemnation\u201d\u2014 ","And a multitude was sitting around Him; and they said to Him
 \u201cLook
 Your mother and Your brothers are outside seeking You.\u201d","But He answered them
 saying
 \u201cWho is My mother
 or My brothers?\u201d ","And He looked around in a circle at those who sat about Him
 and said
 \u201cHere are My mother and My brothers! ","For whoever does the will of God is My brother and My sister and mother.\u201d","Then He taught them many things by parables
 and said to them in His teaching:","\u201cListen! Behold
 a sower went out to sow. ","And it happened
 as he sowed
 that some seed fell by the wayside; and the birds of the air came and devoured it. ","Some fell on stony ground
 where it did not have much earth; and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of earth. ","But when the sun was up it was scorched
 and because it had no root it withered away. ","And some seed fell among thorns; and the thorns grew up and choked it
 and it yielded no crop. ","But other seed fell on good ground and yielded a crop that sprang up
 increased and produced: some thirtyfold
 some sixty
 and some a hundred.\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cHe who has ears to hear
 let him hear!\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cTo you it has been given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God; but to those who are outside
 all things come in parables
 ","so that \u2018Seeing they may see and not perceive
 And hearing they may hear and not understand; Lest they should turn
 And their sins be forgiven them.\u2019 \u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cDo you not understand this parable? How then will you understand all the parables? ","The sower sows the word.","And these are the ones by the wayside where the word is sown. When they hear
 Satan comes immediately and takes away the word that was sown in their hearts. ","These likewise are the ones sown on stony ground who
 when they hear the word
 immediately receive it with gladness; ","and they have no root in themselves
 and so endure only for a time. Afterward
 when tribulation or persecution arises for the word\u2019s sake
 immediately they stumble. ","Now these are the ones sown among thorns; they are the ones who hear the word
 ","and the cares of this world
 the deceitfulness of riches
 and the desires for other things entering in choke the word
 and it becomes unfruitful. ","But these are the ones sown on good ground
 those who hear the word
 accept it
 and bear fruit: some thirtyfold
 some sixty
 and some a hundred.\u201d","Also He said to them
 \u201cIs a lamp brought to be put under a basket or under a bed? Is it not to be set on a lampstand? ","For there is nothing hidden which will not be revealed
 nor has anything been kept secret but that it should come to light. ","If anyone has ears to hear
 let him hear.\u201d","Then He said to them
 \u201cTake heed what you hear. With the same measure you use
 it will be measured to you; and to you who hear
 more will be given. ","For whoever has
 to him more will be given; but whoever does not have
 even what he has will be taken away from him.\u201d","And He said
 \u201cThe kingdom of God is as if a man should scatter seed on the ground
 ","and should sleep by night and rise by day
 and the seed should sprout and grow
 he himself does not know how. ","For the earth yields crops by itself: first the blade
 then the head
 after that the full grain in the head. ","But when the grain ripens
 immediately he puts in the sickle
 because the harvest has come.\u201d","Then He said
 \u201cTo what shall we liken the kingdom of God? Or with what parable shall we picture it? ","It is like a mustard seed which
 when it is sown on the ground
 is smaller than all the seeds on earth; ","but when it is sown
 it grows up and becomes greater than all herbs
 and shoots out large branches
 so that the birds of the air may nest under its shade.\u201d","On the same day
 when evening had come
 He said to them
 \u201cLet us cross over to the other side.\u201d ","Then He arose and rebuked the wind
 and said to the sea
 \u201cPeace
 be still!\u201d And the wind ceased and there was a great calm. ","But He said to them
 \u201cWhy are you so fearful? How is it that you have no faith?\u201d ","For He said to him
 \u201cCome out of the man
 unclean spirit!\u201d ","Then He asked him
 \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d And he answered
 saying
 \u201cMy name is Legion; for we are many.\u201d ","However
 Jesus did not permit him
 but said to him
 \u201cGo home to your friends
 and tell them what great things the Lord has done for you
 and how He has had compassion on you.\u201d ","For she said
 \u201cIf only I may touch His clothes
 I shall be made well.\u201d","But His disciples said to Him
 \u201cYou see the multitude thronging You
 and You say
 \u2018Who touched Me?\u2019 \u201d","And He said to her
 \u201cDaughter
 your faith has made you well. Go in peace
 and be healed of your affliction.\u201d","As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken
 He said to the ruler of the synagogue
 \u201cDo not be afraid; only believe.\u201d ","When He came in
 He said to them
 \u201cWhy make this commotion and weep? The child is not dead
 but sleeping.\u201d","Then He took the child by the hand
 and said to her
 \u201cTalitha
 cumi
\u201d which is translated
 \u201cLittle girl
 I say to you
 arise.\u201d ","But Jesus said to them
 \u201cA prophet is not without honor except in his own country
 among his own relatives
 and in his own house.\u201d ","And He called the twelve to Himself
 and began to send them out two by two
 and gave them power over unclean spirits. ","Also He said to them
 \u201cIn whatever place you enter a house
 stay there till you depart from that place. ","And whoever will not receive you nor hear you
 when you depart from there
 shake off the dust under your feet as a testimony against them. Assuredly
 I say to you
 it will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city!\u201d","But when Herod heard
 he said
 \u201cThis is John

 and pleased Herod and those who sat with him
 the king said to the girl
 \u201cAsk me whatever you want
 and I will give it to you.\u201d ","So she went out and said to her mother
 \u201cWhat shall I ask?\u201d And she said
 \u201cThe head of John the Baptist!\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cCome aside by yourselves to a deserted place and rest a while.\u201d For there were many coming and going
 and they did not even have time to eat. ","But He answered and said to them
 \u201cYou give them something to eat.\u201d And they said to Him
 \u201cShall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread and give them something to eat?\u201d","But He said to them
 \u201cHow many loaves do you have? Go and see.\u201d And when they found out they said
 \u201cFive
 and two fish.\u201d","for they all saw Him and were troubled. But immediately He talked with them and said to them
 \u201cBe of good cheer! It is I; do not be afraid.\u201d ","He answered and said to them
 \u201cWell did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites
 as it is written: \u2018This people honors Me with their lips
 But their heart is far from Me.","And in vain they worship Me

 you hold the tradition of men\u2014the washing of pitchers and cups
 and many other such things you do.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cAll too well you reject the commandment of God
 that you may keep your tradition. ","For Moses said
 \u2018Honor your father and your mother\u2019; and
 \u2018He who curses father or mother
 let him be put to death.\u2019 ","But you say
 \u2018If a man says to his father or mother
 \u201cWhatever profit you might have received from me is Corban\u201d\u2014\u2019 (that is
 a gift to God)
 ","then you no longer let him do anything for his father or his mother
 ","making the word of God of no effect through your tradition which you have handed down. And many such things you do.\u201d","When He had called all the multitude to Himself
 He said to them
 \u201cHear Me
 everyone
 and understand: ","There is nothing that enters a man from outside which can defile him; but the things which come out of him
 those are the things that defile a man. ","So He said to them
 \u201cAre you thus without understanding also? Do you not perceive that whatever enters a man from outside cannot defile him
 ","because it does not enter his heart but his stomach
 and is eliminated
 thus purifying all foods?\u201d ","And He said
 \u201cWhat comes out of a man
 that defiles a man. ","For from within
 out of the heart of men
 proceed evil thoughts

 fornications
 murders

 covetousness
 wickedness
 deceit
 lewdness
 an evil eye
 blasphemy
 pride
 foolishness. ","All these evil things come from within and defile a man.\u201d A Gentile Shows Her Faith","But Jesus said to her

 they will faint on the way; for some of them have come from afar.\u201d","He asked them
 \u201cHow many loaves do you have?\u201d And they said
 \u201cSeven.\u201d","But He sighed deeply in His spirit

 \u201cTake heed
 beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.\u201d","But Jesus

 \u201cWhy do you reason because you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive nor understand? Is your heart still hardened? ","Having eyes
 do you not see? And having ears

 all things are possible to him who believes.\u201d","When Jesus saw that the people came running together
 He rebuked the unclean spirit
 saying to it
 \u201cDeaf and dumb spirit
 I command you
 come out of him and enter him no more!\u201d ","So He said to them
 \u201cThis kind can come out by nothing but prayer and fasting.\u201d","For He taught His disciples and said to them
 \u201cThe Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of men
 and they will kill Him. And after He is killed
 He will rise the third day.\u201d ","Then He came to Capernaum. And when He was in the house He asked them
 \u201cWhat was it you disputed among yourselves on the road?\u201d ","And He sat down
 called the twelve
 and said to them
 \u201cIf anyone desires to be first
 he shall be last of all and servant of all.\u201d ","Then He took a little child and set him in the midst of them. And when He had taken him in His arms

 \u201cDo not forbid him

 I say to you
 he will by no means lose his reward. Jesus Warns of Offenses","\u201cBut whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to stumble
 it would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck
 and he were thrown into the sea. ","If your hand causes you to sin
 cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life maimed

 to go to hell
 into the fire that shall never be quenched\u2014 ","And if your foot causes you to sin
 cut it off. It is better for you to enter life lame
 rather than having two feet
 to be cast into hell
 into the fire that shall never be quenched\u2014 ","And if your eye causes you to sin
 pluck it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye
 rather than having two eyes
 to be cast into hell fire\u2014 ","where \u2018Their worm does not die And the fire is not quenched.\u2019","\u201cFor everyone will be seasoned with fire
 and every sacrifice will be seasoned with salt. ","Salt is good

 how will you season it? Have salt in yourselves

 \u201cWhat did Moses command you?\u201d","And Jesus answered and said to them
 \u201cBecause of the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept. ","But from the beginning of the creation
 God \u2018made them male and female.\u2019 ","\u2018For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife
 ","and the two shall become one flesh\u2019; so then they are no longer two
 but one flesh. ","Therefore what God has joined together
 let not man separate.\u201d","So He said to them

 she commits adultery.\u201d","But when Jesus saw it

 \u201cOne thing you lack: Go your way

 \u201cChildren

 saying among themselves
 \u201cWho then can be saved?\u201d","But Jesus looked at them and said

 \u201cYou do not know what you ask. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink

 \u201cWe are able.\u201d So Jesus said to them
 \u201cYou will indeed drink the cup that I drink

 \u201cYou know that those who are considered rulers over the Gentiles lord it over them

 that he might receive some of the fruit of the vineyard from the vinedressers. ","And they took him and beat him and sent him away empty-handed.","Again he sent them another servant

 \u2018They will respect my son.\u2019 ","But those vinedressers said among themselves
 \u2018This is the heir. Come
 let us kill him

 knowing their hypocrisy

 \u201cRender to Caesar the things that are Caesar\u2019s

 \u201cAre you not therefore mistaken
 because you do not know the Scriptures nor the power of God? ","For when they rise from the dead
 they neither marry nor are given in marriage
 but are like angels in heaven. ","But concerning the dead
 that they rise
 have you not read in the book of Moses
 in the burning bush passage
 how God spoke to him
 saying
 \u2018I am the God of Abraham
 the God of Isaac
 and the God of Jacob\u2019? ","He is not the God of the dead
 but the God of the living. You are therefore greatly mistaken.\u201d","Then one of the scribes came
 and having heard them reasoning together
 perceiving that He had answered them well
 asked Him
 \u201cWhich is the first commandment of all?\u201d","Jesus answered him
 \u201cThe first of all the commandments is: \u2018Hear
 O Israel
 the Lord our God
 the Lord is one. ","And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart
 with all your soul
 with all your mind
 and with all your strength.\u2019 This is the first commandment. ","And the second
 like it
 is this: \u2018You shall love your neighbor as yourself.\u2019 There is no other commandment greater than these.\u201d","Now when Jesus saw that he answered wisely
 He said to him
 \u201cYou are not far from the kingdom of God.\u201d But after that no one dared question Him. Jesus: How Can David Call His Descendant Lord?","Then Jesus answered and said
 while He taught in the temple
 \u201cHow is it that the scribes say that the Christ is the Son of David? ","For David himself said by the Holy Spirit: \u2018The Lord said to my Lord
 \u201cSit at My right hand
 Till I make Your enemies Your footstool.\u201d \u2019","Therefore David himself calls Him \u2018Lord\u2019; how is He then his Son?\u201d And the common people heard Him gladly. Beware of the Scribes","Then He said to them in His teaching
 \u201cBeware of the scribes
 who desire to go around in long robes
 love greetings in the marketplaces
 ","the best seats in the synagogues
 and the best places at feasts
 ","who devour widows\u2019 houses
 and for a pretense make long prayers. These will receive greater condemnation.\u201d The Widow\u2019s Two Mites","So He called His disciples to Himself and said to them
 \u201cAssuredly
 I say to you that this poor widow has put in more than all those who have given to the treasury; ","for they all put in out of their abundance
 but she out of her poverty put in all that she had
 her whole livelihood.\u201d","Then as He went out of the temple
 one of His disciples said to Him
 \u201cTeacher
 see what manner of stones and what buildings are here!\u201d","And Jesus answered and said to him
 \u201cDo you see these great buildings? Not one stone shall be left upon another
 that shall not be thrown down.\u201d","And Jesus
 answering them
 began to say: \u201cTake heed that no one deceives you. ","For many will come in My name
 saying
 \u2018I am He
\u2019 and will deceive many. ","But when you hear of wars and rumors of wars
 do not be troubled; for such things must happen
 but the end is not yet. ","For nation will rise against nation
 and kingdom against kingdom. And there will be earthquakes in various places
 and there will be famines and troubles. These are the beginnings of sorrows.","\u201cBut watch out for yourselves
 for they will deliver you up to councils
 and you will be beaten in the synagogues. You will be brought before rulers and kings for My sake
 for a testimony to them. ","And the gospel must first be preached to all the nations.","But when they arrest you and deliver you up
 do not worry beforehand
 or premeditate what you will speak. But whatever is given you in that hour
 speak that; for it is not you who speak
 but the Holy Spirit. ","Now brother will betray brother to death
 and a father his child; and children will rise up against parents and cause them to be put to death. ","And you will be hated by all for My name\u2019s sake. But he who endures to the end shall be saved.","\u201cSo when you see the \u2018abomination of desolation
\u2019 spoken of by Daniel the prophet
 standing where it ought not\u201d (let the reader understand)
 \u201cthen let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. ","Let him who is on the housetop not go down into the house
 nor enter to take anything out of his house. ","And let him who is in the field not go back to get his clothes.","But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days!","And pray that your flight may not be in winter.","For in those days there will be tribulation
 such as has not been since the beginning of the creation which God created until this time
 nor ever shall be. ","And unless the Lord had shortened those days
 no flesh would be saved; but for the elect\u2019s sake
 whom He chose
 He shortened the days.","\u201cThen if anyone says to you
 \u2018Look
 here is the Christ!\u2019 or
 \u2018Look
 He is there!\u2019 do not believe it. ","For false christs and false prophets will rise and show signs and wonders to deceive
 if possible
 even the elect. ","But take heed; see
 I have told you all things beforehand. The Coming of the Son of Man","\u201cBut in those days
 after that tribulation
 the sun will be darkened
 and the moon will not give its light; ","the stars of heaven will fall
 and the powers in the heavens will be shaken. ","Then they will see the Son of Man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.","And then He will send His angels
 and gather together His elect from the four winds
 from the farthest part of earth to the farthest part of heaven. The Parable of the Fig Tree","\u201cNow learn this parable from the fig tree: When its branch has already become tender
 and puts forth leaves
 you know that summer is near. ","So you also
 when you see these things happening
 know that it is near\u2014at the doors! ","Assuredly
 I say to you
 this generation will by no means pass away till all these things take place. ","Heaven and earth will pass away
 but My words will by no means pass away. No One Knows the Day or Hour","\u201cBut of that day and hour no one knows
 not even the angels in heaven
 nor the Son
 but only the Father. ","Take heed
 watch and pray; for you do not know when the time is. ","It is like a man going to a far country
 who left his house and gave authority to his servants
 and to each his work
 and commanded the doorkeeper to watch. ","Watch therefore
 for you do not know when the master of the house is coming\u2014in the evening
 at midnight
 at the crowing of the rooster
 or in the morning\u2014 ","lest
 coming suddenly
 he find you sleeping. ","And what I say to you
 I say to all: Watch!\u201d","But there were some who were indignant among themselves
 and said
 \u201cWhy was this fragrant oil wasted? ","But Jesus said
 \u201cLet her alone. Why do you trouble her? She has done a good work for Me. ","For you have the poor with you always
 and whenever you wish you may do them good; but Me you do not have always. ","She has done what she could. She has come beforehand to anoint My body for burial.","Assuredly
 I say to you
 wherever this gospel is preached in the whole world
 what this woman has done will also be told as a memorial to her.\u201d","And He sent out two of His disciples and said to them
 \u201cGo into the city

 \u201cWhere is the guest room in which I may eat the Passover with My disciples?\u201d \u2019 ","Then he will show you a large upper room
 furnished and prepared; there make ready for us.\u201d","Now as they sat and ate

 \u201cAssuredly
 I say to you
 one of you who eats with Me will betray Me.\u201d","He answered and said to them
 \u201cIt is one of the twelve
 who dips with Me in the dish. ","The Son of Man indeed goes just as it is written of Him
 but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been good for that man if he had never been born.\u201d","And as they were eating
 Jesus took bread
 blessed and broke it
 and gave it to them and said
 \u201cTake
 eat; this is My body.\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cThis is My blood of the new covenant
 which is shed for many. ","Assuredly
 I say to you
 I will no longer drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.\u201d","Then Jesus said to them
 \u201cAll of you will be made to stumble because of Me this night

 And the sheep will be scattered.\u2019","\u201cBut after I have been raised
 I will go before you to Galilee.\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cAssuredly
 I say to you that today

 \u201cSit here while I pray.\u201d ","Then He said to them
 \u201cMy soul is exceedingly sorrowful
 even to death. Stay here and watch.\u201d","And He said
 \u201cAbba
 Father

 not what I will
 but what You will.\u201d","Then He came and found them sleeping
 and said to Peter
 \u201cSimon
 are you sleeping? Could you not watch one hour? ","Watch and pray
 lest you enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing

 \u201cAre you still sleeping and resting? It is enough! The hour has come; behold
 the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners. ","Rise
 let us be going. See
 My betrayer is at hand.\u201d Betrayal and Arrest in Gethsemane","Then Jesus answered and said to them
 \u201cHave you come out
 as against a robber
 with swords and clubs to take Me? ","I was daily with you in the temple teaching
 and you did not seize Me. But the Scriptures must be fulfilled.\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cI am. And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power

 and Weeps","A second time the rooster crowed. Then Peter called to mind the word that Jesus had said to him
 \u201cBefore the rooster crows twice
 you will deny Me three times.\u201d And when he thought about it
 he wept.","Then Pilate asked Him
 \u201cAre You the King of the Jews?\u201d He answered and said to him
 \u201cIt is as you say.\u201d","But Pilate answered them
 saying
 \u201cDo you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?\u201d ","And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice

 who stood opposite Him
 saw that He cried out like this and breathed His last
 he said
 \u201cTruly this Man was the Son of God!\u201d","Pilate marveled that He was already dead; and summoning the centurion
 he asked him if He had been dead for some time. ","And they said among themselves
 \u201cWho will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for us?\u201d ","But he said to them
 \u201cDo not be alarmed. You seek Jesus of Nazareth

 \u201cGo into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.

 \u201cCome
 follow me

 they said
 \u201cEveryone is looking for you.\u201d","But Jesus replied
 \u201cWe must go on to other towns as well

 go to the priest and let him examine you. Take along the offering required in the law of Moses for those who have been healed of leprosy. This will be a public testimony that you have been cleansed.\u201d","Seeing their faith
 Jesus said to the paralyzed man
 \u201cMy child
 your sins are forgiven.\u201d","Jesus knew immediately what they were thinking

 \u201cDo wedding guests fast while celebrating with the groom? Of course not. They can\u2019t fast while the groom is with them.","But someday the groom will be taken away from them
 and then they will fast.","\u201cBesides
 who would patch old clothing with new cloth? For the new patch would shrink and rip away from the old cloth
 leaving an even bigger tear than before.","\u201cAnd no one puts new wine into old wineskins. For the wine would burst the wineskins
 and the wine and the skins would both be lost. New wine calls for new wineskins.\u201d","But the Pharisees said to Jesus

 why are they breaking the law by harvesting grain on the Sabbath?\u201d","Jesus said to them

 \u201cDoes the law permit good deeds on the Sabbath

 \u201cHold out your hand.\u201d So the man held out his hand

 a family splintered by feuding will fall apart.","And if Satan is divided and fights against himself

 all sin and blasphemy can be forgiven
","but anyone who blasphemes the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven. This is a sin with eternal consequences.\u201d","There was a crowd sitting around Jesus
 and someone said

 \u201cLook

 and the birds came and ate it.","Other seed fell on shallow soil with underlying rock. The seed sprouted quickly because the soil was shallow.","But the plant soon wilted under the hot sun
 and since it didn\u2019t have deep roots
 it died.","Other seed fell among thorns that grew up and choked out the tender plants so they produced no grain.","Still other seeds fell on fertile soil
 and they sprouted
 grew
 and produced a crop that was thirty
 sixty
 and even a hundred times as much as had been planted!\u201d","Then he said
 \u201cAnyone with ears to hear should listen and understand.\u201d","He replied
 \u201cYou are permitted to understand the secret of the Kingdom of God. But I use parables for everything I say to outsiders
","so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled: \u2018When they see what I do
 they will learn nothing. When they hear what I say
 they will not understand. Otherwise
 they will turn to me and be forgiven.\u2019\u201d","Then Jesus said to them
 \u201cIf you can\u2019t understand the meaning of this parable
 how will you understand all the other parables?","The farmer plants seed by taking God\u2019s word to others.","The seed that fell on the footpath represents those who hear the message
 only to have Satan come at once and take it away.","The seed on the rocky soil represents those who hear the message and immediately receive it with joy.","But since they don\u2019t have deep roots
 they don\u2019t last long. They fall away as soon as they have problems or are persecuted for believing God\u2019s word.","The seed that fell among the thorns represents others who hear God\u2019s word
","but all too quickly the message is crowded out by the worries of this life
 the lure of wealth
 and the desire for other things
 so no fruit is produced.","And the seed that fell on good soil represents those who hear and accept God\u2019s word and produce a harvest of thirty
 sixty
 or even a hundred times as much as had been planted!\u201d","Then Jesus asked them
 \u201cWould anyone light a lamp and then put it under a basket or under a bed? Of course not! A lamp is placed on a stand
 where its light will shine.","For everything that is hidden will eventually be brought into the open
 and every secret will be brought to light.","Anyone with ears to hear should listen and understand.\u201d","Then he added
 \u201cPay close attention to what you hear. The closer you listen
 the more understanding you will be given\u2014and you will receive even more.","To those who listen to my teaching
 more understanding will be given. But for those who are not listening
 even what little understanding they have will be taken away from them.\u201d","Jesus also said
 \u201cThe Kingdom of God is like a farmer who scatters seed on the ground.","Night and day
 while he\u2019s asleep or awake
 the seed sprouts and grows
 but he does not understand how it happens.","The earth produces the crops on its own. First a leaf blade pushes through
 then the heads of wheat are formed
 and finally the grain ripens.","And as soon as the grain is ready
 the farmer comes and harvests it with a sickle
 for the harvest time has come.\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cHow can I describe the Kingdom of God? What story should I use to illustrate it?","It is like a mustard seed planted in the ground. It is the smallest of all seeds
","but it becomes the largest of all garden plants; it grows long branches
 and birds can make nests in its shade.\u201d","As evening came
 Jesus said to his disciples
 \u201cLet\u2019s cross to the other side of the lake.\u201d","When Jesus woke up
 he rebuked the wind and said to the waves
 \u201cSilence! Be still!\u201d Suddenly the wind stopped
 and there was a great calm.","Then he asked them
 \u201cWhy are you afraid? Do you still have no faith?\u201d","For Jesus had already said to the spirit
 \u201cCome out of the man
 you evil spirit.\u201d","Then Jesus demanded
 \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d And he replied
 \u201cMy name is Legion
 because there are many of us inside this man.\u201d","But Jesus said
 \u201cNo
 go home to your family
 and tell them everything the Lord has done for you and how merciful he has been.\u201d","For she thought to herself
 \u201cIf I can just touch his robe
 I will be healed.\u201d","His disciples said to him
 \u201cLook at this crowd pressing around you. How can you ask
 \u2018Who touched me?\u2019\u201d","And he said to her
 \u201cDaughter
 your faith has made you well. Go in peace. Your suffering is over.\u201d","But Jesus overheard them and said to Jairus
 \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. Just have faith.\u201d","He went inside and asked
 \u201cWhy all this commotion and weeping? The child isn\u2019t dead; she\u2019s only asleep.\u201d","Holding her hand
 he said to her
 \u201cTalitha koum
\u201d which means \u201cLittle girl
 get up!\u201d","Then Jesus told them
 \u201cA prophet is honored everywhere except in his own hometown and among his relatives and his own family.\u201d","And he called his twelve disciples together and began sending them out two by two
 giving them authority to cast out evil spirits.","\u201cWherever you go
\u201d he said
 \u201cstay in the same house until you leave town.","But if any place refuses to welcome you or listen to you
 shake its dust from your feet as you leave to show that you have abandoned those people to their fate.\u201d","When Herod heard about Jesus
 he said
 \u201cJohn
 the man I beheaded
 has come back from the dead.\u201d","Then his daughter
 also named Herodias
 came in and performed a dance that greatly pleased Herod and his guests. \u201cAsk me for anything you like
\u201d the king said to the girl
 \u201cand I will give it to you.\u201d","She went out and asked her mother
 \u201cWhat should I ask for?\u201d Her mother told her
 \u201cAsk for the head of John the Baptist!\u201d","Then Jesus said
 \u201cLet\u2019s go off by ourselves to a quiet place and rest awhile.\u201d He said this because there were so many people coming and going that Jesus and his apostles didn\u2019t even have time to eat.","But Jesus said
 \u201cYou feed them.\u201d \u201cWith what?\u201d they asked. \u201cWe\u2019d have to work for months to earn enough money to buy food for all these people!\u201d","\u201cHow much bread do you have?\u201d he asked. \u201cGo and find out.\u201d They came back and reported
 \u201cWe have five loaves of bread and two fish.\u201d","They were all terrified when they saw him. But Jesus spoke to them at once. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid
\u201d he said. \u201cTake courage! I am here!\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cYou hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you
 for he wrote
 \u2018These people honor me with their lips
 but their hearts are far from me.","Their worship is a farce
 for they teach man-made ideas as commands from God.\u2019","For you ignore God\u2019s law and substitute your own tradition.\u201d","Then he said
 \u201cYou skillfully sidestep God\u2019s law in order to hold on to your own tradition.","For instance
 Moses gave you this law from God: \u2018Honor your father and mother
\u2019 and \u2018Anyone who speaks disrespectfully of father or mother must be put to death.\u2019","But you say it is all right for people to say to their parents
 \u2018Sorry
 I can\u2019t help you. For I have vowed to give to God what I would have given to you.\u2019","In this way
 you let them disregard their needy parents.","And so you cancel the word of God in order to hand down your own tradition. And this is only one example among many others.\u201d","Then Jesus called to the crowd to come and hear. \u201cAll of you listen
\u201d he said
 \u201cand try to understand.","It\u2019s not what goes into your body that defiles you; you are defiled by what comes from your heart.\u201d","\u201cDon\u2019t you understand either?\u201d he asked. \u201cCan\u2019t you see that the food you put into your body cannot defile you?","Food doesn\u2019t go into your heart
 but only passes through the stomach and then goes into the sewer.\u201d (By saying this
 he declared that every kind of food is acceptable in God\u2019s eyes.)","And then he added
 \u201cIt is what comes from inside that defiles you.","For from within
 out of a person\u2019s heart
 come evil thoughts
 sexual immorality
 theft
 murder
","adultery
 greed
 wickedness
 deceit
 lustful desires
 envy
 slander
 pride
 and foolishness.","All these vile things come from within; they are what defile you.\u201d","Jesus told her
 \u201cFirst I should feed the children\u2014my own family
 the Jews. It isn\u2019t right to take food from the children and throw it to the dogs.\u201d","\u201cGood answer!\u201d he said. \u201cNow go home
 for the demon has left your daughter.\u201d","Looking up to heaven
 he sighed and said
 \u201cEphphatha
\u201d which means
 \u201cBe opened!\u201d","About this time another large crowd had gathered
 and the people ran out of food again. Jesus called his disciples and told them
","\u201cI feel sorry for these people. They have been here with me for three days
 and they have nothing left to eat.","If I send them home hungry
 they will faint along the way. For some of them have come a long distance.\u201d","Jesus asked
 \u201cHow much bread do you have?\u201d \u201cSeven loaves
\u201d they replied.","When he heard this
 he sighed deeply in his spirit and said
 \u201cWhy do these people keep demanding a miraculous sign? I tell you the truth
 I will not give this generation any such sign.\u201d","As they were crossing the lake
 Jesus warned them
 \u201cWatch out! Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and of Herod.\u201d","Jesus knew what they were saying
 so he said
 \u201cWhy are you arguing about having no bread? Don\u2019t you know or understand even yet? Are your hearts too hard to take it in?","\u2018You have eyes\u2014can\u2019t you see? You have ears\u2014can\u2019t you hear?\u2019 Don\u2019t you remember anything at all?","When I fed the 5
000 with five loaves of bread
 how many baskets of leftovers did you pick up afterward?\u201d \u201cTwelve
\u201d they said.","\u201cAnd when I fed the 4
000 with seven loaves
 how many large baskets of leftovers did you pick up?\u201d \u201cSeven
\u201d they said.","\u201cDon\u2019t you understand yet?\u201d he asked them.","Jesus took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village. Then
 spitting on the man\u2019s eyes
 he laid his hands on him and asked
 \u201cCan you see anything now?\u201d","Jesus sent him away
 saying
 \u201cDon\u2019t go back into the village on your way home.\u201d","Jesus and his disciples left Galilee and went up to the villages near Caesarea Philippi. As they were walking along
 he asked them
 \u201cWho do people say I am?\u201d","Then he asked them
 \u201cBut who do you say I am?\u201d Peter replied
 \u201cYou are the Messiah.\u201d","Jesus turned around and looked at his disciples
 then reprimanded Peter. \u201cGet away from me
 Satan!\u201d he said. \u201cYou are seeing things merely from a human point of view
 not from God\u2019s.\u201d","Then
 calling the crowd to join his disciples
 he said
 \u201cIf any of you wants to be my follower
 you must give up your own way
 take up your cross
 and follow me.","If you try to hang on to your life
 you will lose it. But if you give up your life for my sake and for the sake of the Good News
 you will save it.","And what do you benefit if you gain the whole world but lose your own soul?","Is anything worth more than your soul?","If anyone is ashamed of me and my message in these adulterous and sinful days
 the Son of Man will be ashamed of that person when he returns in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.\u201d","Jesus went on to say
 \u201cI tell you the truth
 some standing here right now will not die before they see the Kingdom of God arrive in great power!\u201d","Peter exclaimed
 \u201cRabbi
 it\u2019s wonderful for us to be here! Let\u2019s make three shelters as memorials\u2014one for you
 one for Moses
 and one for Elijah.\u201d","Jesus responded
 \u201cElijah is indeed coming first to get everything ready. Yet why do the Scriptures say that the Son of Man must suffer greatly and be treated with utter contempt?","But I tell you
 Elijah has already come
 and they chose to abuse him
 just as the Scriptures predicted.\u201d","\u201cWhat is all this arguing about?\u201d Jesus asked.","Jesus said to them
 \u201cYou faithless people! How long must I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring the boy to me.\u201d","\u201cHow long has this been happening?\u201d Jesus asked the boy\u2019s father. He replied
 \u201cSince he was a little boy.","\u201cWhat do you mean
 \u2018If I can\u2019?\u201d Jesus asked. \u201cAnything is possible if a person believes.\u201d","When Jesus saw that the crowd of onlookers was growing
 he rebuked the evil spirit. \u201cListen
 you spirit that makes this boy unable to hear and speak
\u201d he said. \u201cI command you to come out of this child and never enter him again!\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cThis kind can be cast out only by prayer.\u201d","for he wanted to spend more time with his disciples and teach them. He said to them
 \u201cThe Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of his enemies. He will be killed
 but three days later he will rise from the dead.\u201d","After they arrived at Capernaum and settled in a house
 Jesus asked his disciples
 \u201cWhat were you discussing out on the road?\u201d","He sat down
 called the twelve disciples over to him
 and said
 \u201cWhoever wants to be first must take last place and be the servant of everyone else.\u201d","Then he put a little child among them. Taking the child in his arms
 he said to them
","\u201cDon\u2019t stop him!\u201d Jesus said. \u201cNo one who performs a miracle in my name will soon be able to speak evil of me.","Anyone who is not against us is for us.","If anyone gives you even a cup of water because you belong to the Messiah
 I tell you the truth
 that person will surely be rewarded.","\u201cBut if you cause one of these little ones who trusts in me to fall into sin
 it would be better for you to be thrown into the sea with a large millstone hung around your neck.","If your hand causes you to sin
 cut it off. It\u2019s better to enter eternal life with only one hand than to go into the unquenchable fires of hell with two hands.","If your foot causes you to sin
 cut it off. It\u2019s better to enter eternal life with only one foot than to be thrown into hell with two feet.","And if your eye causes you to sin
 gouge it out. It\u2019s better to enter the Kingdom of God with only one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell
","\u2018where the maggots never die and the fire never goes out.\u2019","\u201cFor everyone will be tested with fire.","Salt is good for seasoning. But if it loses its flavor
 how do you make it salty again? You must have the qualities of salt among yourselves and live in peace with each other.\u201d","Jesus answered them with a question: \u201cWhat did Moses say in the law about divorce?\u201d","But Jesus responded
 \u201cHe wrote this commandment only as a concession to your hard hearts.","But \u2018God made them male and female\u2019 from the beginning of creation.","\u2018This explains why a man leaves his father and mother and is joined to his wife
","and the two are united into one.\u2019 Since they are no longer two but one
","let no one split apart what God has joined together.\u201d","He told them
 \u201cWhoever divorces his wife and marries someone else commits adultery against her.","And if a woman divorces her husband and marries someone else
 she commits adultery.\u201d","When Jesus saw what was happening
 he was angry with his disciples. He said to them
 \u201cLet the children come to me. Don\u2019t stop them! For the Kingdom of God belongs to those who are like these children.","I tell you the truth
 anyone who doesn\u2019t receive the Kingdom of God like a child will never enter it.\u201d","\u201cWhy do you call me good?\u201d Jesus asked. \u201cOnly God is truly good.","But to answer your question
 you know the commandments: \u2018You must not murder. You must not commit adultery. You must not steal. You must not testify falsely. You must not cheat anyone. Honor your father and mother.\u2019\u201d","\u201cTeacher
\u201d the man replied
 \u201cI\u2019ve obeyed all these commandments since I was young.\u201d","Looking at the man
 Jesus felt genuine love for him. \u201cThere is still one thing you haven\u2019t done
\u201d he told him. \u201cGo and sell all your possessions and give the money to the poor
 and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come
 follow me.\u201d","Jesus looked around and said to his disciples
 \u201cHow hard it is for the rich to enter the Kingdom of God!\u201d","This amazed them. But Jesus said again
 \u201cDear children
 it is very hard to enter the Kingdom of God.","In fact
 it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the Kingdom of God!\u201d","The disciples were astounded. \u201cThen who in the world can be saved?\u201d they asked.","Jesus looked at them intently and said
 \u201cHumanly speaking
 it is impossible. But not with God. Everything is possible with God.\u201d","\u201cYes
\u201d Jesus replied
 \u201cand I assure you that everyone who has given up house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or property
 for my sake and for the Good News
","will receive now in return a hundred times as many houses
 brothers
 sisters
 mothers
 children
 and property\u2014along with persecution. And in the world to come that person will have eternal life.","But many who are the greatest now will be least important then
 and those who seem least important now will be the greatest then.\u201d","\u201cListen
\u201d he said
 \u201cwe\u2019re going up to Jerusalem
 where the Son of Man will be betrayed to the leading priests and the teachers of religious law. They will sentence him to die and hand him over to the Romans.","They will mock him
 spit on him
 flog him with a whip
 and kill him
 but after three days he will rise again.\u201d","Then James and John
 the sons of Zebedee
 came over and spoke to him. \u201cTeacher
\u201d they said
 \u201cwe want you to do us a favor.\u201d","\u201cWhat is your request?\u201d he asked.","But Jesus said to them
 \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you are asking! Are you able to drink from the bitter cup of suffering I am about to drink? Are you able to be baptized with the baptism of suffering I must be baptized with?\u201d","\u201cOh yes
\u201d they replied
 \u201cwe are able!\u201d Then Jesus told them
 \u201cYou will indeed drink from my bitter cup and be baptized with my baptism of suffering.","But I have no right to say who will sit on my right or my left. God has prepared those places for the ones he has chosen.\u201d","So Jesus called them together and said
 \u201cYou know that the rulers in this world lord it over their people
 and officials flaunt their authority over those under them.","But among you it will be different. Whoever wants to be a leader among you must be your servant
","and whoever wants to be first among you must be the slave of everyone else.","For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve others and to give his life as a ransom for many.\u201d","When Jesus heard him
 he stopped and said
 \u201cTell him to come here.\u201d So they called the blind man. \u201cCheer up
\u201d they said. \u201cCome on
 he\u2019s calling you!\u201d","\u201cWhat do you want me to do for you?\u201d Jesus asked. \u201cMy Rabbi
\u201d the blind man said
 \u201cI want to see!\u201d","And Jesus said to him
 \u201cGo
 for your faith has healed you.\u201d Instantly the man could see
 and he followed Jesus down the road.","\u201cGo into that village over there
\u201d he told them. \u201cAs soon as you enter it
 you will see a young donkey tied there that no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here.","If anyone asks
 \u2018What are you doing?\u2019 just say
 \u2018The Lord needs it and will return it soon.\u2019\u201d","Then Jesus said to the tree
 \u201cMay no one ever eat your fruit again!\u201d And the disciples heard him say it.","He said to them
 \u201cThe Scriptures declare
 \u2018My Temple will be called a house of prayer for all nations
\u2019 but you have turned it into a den of thieves.\u201d","Then Jesus said to the disciples
 \u201cHave faith in God.","I tell you the truth
 you can say to this mountain
 \u2018May you be lifted up and thrown into the sea
\u2019 and it will happen. But you must really believe it will happen and have no doubt in your heart.","I tell you
 you can pray for anything
 and if you believe that you\u2019ve received it
 it will be yours.","But when you are praying
 first forgive anyone you are holding a grudge against
 so that your Father in heaven will forgive your sins
 too.\u201d","\u201cI\u2019ll tell you by what authority I do these things if you answer one question
\u201d Jesus replied.","\u201cDid John\u2019s authority to baptize come from heaven
 or was it merely human? Answer me!\u201d","So they finally replied
 \u201cWe don\u2019t know.\u201d And Jesus responded
 \u201cThen I won\u2019t tell you by what authority I do these things.\u201d","Then Jesus began teaching them with stories: \u201cA man planted a vineyard. He built a wall around it
 dug a pit for pressing out the grape juice
 and built a lookout tower. Then he leased the vineyard to tenant farmers and moved to another country.","At the time of the grape harvest
 he sent one of his servants to collect his share of the crop.","But the farmers grabbed the servant
 beat him up
 and sent him back empty-handed.","The owner then sent another servant
 but they insulted him and beat him over the head.","The next servant he sent was killed. Others he sent were either beaten or killed
","until there was only one left\u2014his son whom he loved dearly. The owner finally sent him
 thinking
 \u2018Surely they will respect my son.\u2019","\u201cBut the tenant farmers said to one another
 \u2018Here comes the heir to this estate. Let\u2019s kill him and get the estate for ourselves!\u2019","So they grabbed him and murdered him and threw his body out of the vineyard.","\u201cWhat do you suppose the owner of the vineyard will do?\u201d Jesus asked. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you\u2014he will come and kill those farmers and lease the vineyard to others.","Didn\u2019t you ever read this in the Scriptures? \u2018The stone that the builders rejected has now become the cornerstone.","This is the Lord\u2019s doing
 and it is wonderful to see.\u2019\u201d","Later the leaders sent some Pharisees and supporters of Herod to trap Jesus into saying something for which he could be arrested.","Should we pay them
 or shouldn\u2019t we?\u201d Jesus saw through their hypocrisy and said
 \u201cWhy are you trying to trap me? Show me a Roman coin
 and I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d","When they handed it to him
 he asked
 \u201cWhose picture and title are stamped on it?\u201d \u201cCaesar\u2019s
\u201d they replied.","\u201cWell
 then
\u201d Jesus said
 \u201cgive to Caesar what belongs to Caesar
 and give to God what belongs to God.\u201d His reply completely amazed them.","Jesus replied
 \u201cYour mistake is that you don\u2019t know the Scriptures
 and you don\u2019t know the power of God.","For when the dead rise
 they will neither marry nor be given in marriage. In this respect they will be like the angels in heaven.","\u201cBut now
 as to whether the dead will be raised\u2014haven\u2019t you ever read about this in the writings of Moses
 in the story of the burning bush? Long after Abraham
 Isaac
 and Jacob had died
 God said to Moses
 \u2018I am the God of Abraham
 the God of Isaac
 and the God of Jacob.\u2019","So he is the God of the living
 not the dead. You have made a serious error.\u201d","One of the teachers of religious law was standing there listening to the debate. He realized that Jesus had answered well
 so he asked
 \u201cOf all the commandments
 which is the most important?\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cThe most important commandment is this: \u2018Listen
 O Israel! The Lord our God is the one and only Lord.","And you must love the Lord your God with all your heart
 all your soul
 all your mind
 and all your strength.\u2019","The second is equally important: \u2018Love your neighbor as yourself.\u2019 No other commandment is greater than these.\u201d","Realizing how much the man understood
 Jesus said to him
 \u201cYou are not far from the Kingdom of God.\u201d And after that
 no one dared to ask him any more questions.","Later
 as Jesus was teaching the people in the Temple
 he asked
 \u201cWhy do the teachers of religious law claim that the Messiah is the son of David?","For David himself
 speaking under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit
 said
 \u2018The Lord said to my Lord
 Sit in the place of honor at my right hand until I humble your enemies beneath your feet.\u2019","Since David himself called the Messiah \u2018my Lord
\u2019 how can the Messiah be his son?\u201d The large crowd listened to him with great delight.","Jesus also taught: \u201cBeware of these teachers of religious law! For they like to parade around in flowing robes and receive respectful greetings as they walk in the marketplaces.","And how they love the seats of honor in the synagogues and the head table at banquets.","Yet they shamelessly cheat widows out of their property and then pretend to be pious by making long prayers in public. Because of this
 they will be more severely punished.\u201d","Jesus called his disciples to him and said
 \u201cI tell you the truth
 this poor widow has given more than all the others who are making contributions.","For they gave a tiny part of their surplus
 but she
 poor as she is
 has given everything she had to live on.\u201d","As Jesus was leaving the Temple that day
 one of his disciples said
 \u201cTeacher
 look at these magnificent buildings! Look at the impressive stones in the walls.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cYes
 look at these great buildings. But they will be completely demolished. Not one stone will be left on top of another!\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cDon\u2019t let anyone mislead you
","for many will come in my name
 claiming
 \u2018I am the Messiah.\u2019 They will deceive many.","And you will hear of wars and threats of wars
 but don\u2019t panic. Yes
 these things must take place
 but the end won\u2019t follow immediately.","Nation will go to war against nation
 and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in many parts of the world
 as well as famines. But this is only the first of the birth pains
 with more to come.","\u201cWhen these things begin to happen
 watch out! You will be handed over to the local councils and beaten in the synagogues. You will stand trial before governors and kings because you are my followers. But this will be your opportunity to tell them about me.","For the Good News must first be preached to all nations.","But when you are arrested and stand trial
 don\u2019t worry in advance about what to say. Just say what God tells you at that time
 for it is not you who will be speaking
 but the Holy Spirit.","\u201cA brother will betray his brother to death
 a father will betray his own child
 and children will rebel against their parents and cause them to be killed.","And everyone will hate you because you are my followers. But the one who endures to the end will be saved.","\u201cThe day is coming when you will see the sacrilegious object that causes desecration standing where he should not be.\u201d (Reader
 pay attention!) \u201cThen those in Judea must flee to the hills.","A person out on the deck of a roof must not go down into the house to pack.","A person out in the field must not return even to get a coat.","How terrible it will be for pregnant women and for nursing mothers in those days.","And pray that your flight will not be in winter.","For there will be greater anguish in those days than at any time since God created the world. And it will never be so great again.","In fact
 unless the Lord shortens that time of calamity
 not a single person will survive. But for the sake of his chosen ones he has shortened those days.","\u201cThen if anyone tells you
 \u2018Look
 here is the Messiah
\u2019 or \u2018There he is
\u2019 don\u2019t believe it.","For false messiahs and false prophets will rise up and perform signs and wonders so as to deceive
 if possible
 even God\u2019s chosen ones.","Watch out! I have warned you about this ahead of time!","\u201cAt that time
 after the anguish of those days
 the sun will be darkened
 the moon will give no light
","the stars will fall from the sky
 and the powers in the heavens will be shaken.","Then everyone will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds with great power and glory.","And he will send out his angels to gather his chosen ones from all over the world\u2014from the farthest ends of the earth and heaven.","\u201cNow learn a lesson from the fig tree. When its branches bud and its leaves begin to sprout
 you know that summer is near.","In the same way
 when you see all these things taking place
 you can know that his return is very near
 right at the door.","I tell you the truth
 this generation will not pass from the scene before all these things take place.","Heaven and earth will disappear
 but my words will never disappear.","\u201cHowever
 no one knows the day or hour when these things will happen
 not even the angels in heaven or the Son himself. Only the Father knows.","And since you don\u2019t know when that time will come
 be on guard! Stay alert!","\u201cThe coming of the Son of Man can be illustrated by the story of a man going on a long trip. When he left home
 he gave each of his slaves instructions about the work they were to do
 and he told the gatekeeper to watch for his return.","You
 too
 must keep watch! For you don\u2019t know when the master of the household will return\u2014in the evening
 at midnight
 before dawn
 or at daybreak.","Don\u2019t let him find you sleeping when he arrives without warning.","I say to you what I say to everyone: Watch for him!\u201d","Some of those at the table were indignant. \u201cWhy waste such expensive perfume?\u201d they asked.","But Jesus replied
 \u201cLeave her alone. Why criticize her for doing such a good thing to me?","You will always have the poor among you
 and you can help them whenever you want to. But you will not always have me.","She has done what she could and has anointed my body for burial ahead of time.","I tell you the truth
 wherever the Good News is preached throughout the world
 this woman\u2019s deed will be remembered and discussed.\u201d","So Jesus sent two of them into Jerusalem with these instructions: \u201cAs you go into the city
 a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you. Follow him.","At the house he enters

 \u2018The Teacher asks: Where is the guest room where I can eat the Passover meal with my disciples?\u2019","He will take you upstairs to a large room that is already set up. That is where you should prepare our meal.\u201d","As they were at the table eating
 Jesus said
 \u201cI tell you the truth
 one of you eating with me here will betray me.\u201d","He replied
 \u201cIt is one of you twelve who is eating from this bowl with me.","For the Son of Man must die
 as the Scriptures declared long ago. But how terrible it will be for the one who betrays him. It would be far better for that man if he had never been born!\u201d","As they were eating
 Jesus took some bread and blessed it. Then he broke it in pieces and gave it to the disciples
 saying
 \u201cTake it
 for this is my body.\u201d","And he said to them
 \u201cThis is my blood
 which confirms the covenant between God and his people. It is poured out as a sacrifice for many.","I tell you the truth
 I will not drink wine again until the day I drink it new in the Kingdom of God.\u201d","On the way
 Jesus told them
 \u201cAll of you will desert me. For the Scriptures say
 \u2018God will strike the Shepherd
 and the sheep will be scattered.\u2019","But after I am raised from the dead
 I will go ahead of you to Galilee and meet you there.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cI tell you the truth
 Peter\u2014this very night
 before the rooster crows twice
 you will deny three times that you even know me.\u201d","They went to the olive grove called Gethsemane
 and Jesus said
 \u201cSit here while I go and pray.\u201d","He told them
 \u201cMy soul is crushed with grief to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me.\u201d","\u201cAbba
 Father
\u201d he cried out
 \u201ceverything is possible for you. Please take this cup of suffering away from me. Yet I want your will to be done
 not mine.\u201d","Then he returned and found the disciples asleep. He said to Peter
 \u201cSimon
 are you asleep? Couldn\u2019t you watch with me even one hour?","Keep watch and pray
 so that you will not give in to temptation. For the spirit is willing
 but the body is weak.\u201d","When he returned to them the third time
 he said
 \u201cGo ahead and sleep. Have your rest. But no\u2014the time has come. The Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.","Up
 let\u2019s be going. Look
 my betrayer is here!\u201d","Jesus asked them
 \u201cAm I some dangerous revolutionary
 that you come with swords and clubs to arrest me?","Why didn\u2019t you arrest me in the Temple? I was there among you teaching every day. But these things are happening to fulfill what the Scriptures say about me.\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cI am. And you will see the Son of Man seated in the place of power at God\u2019s right hand and coming on the clouds of heaven.\u201d","Then some of them began to spit at him
 and they blindfolded him and beat him with their fists. \u201cProphesy to us
\u201d they jeered. And the guards slapped him as they took him away.","And immediately the rooster crowed the second time. Suddenly
 Jesus\u2019 words flashed through Peter\u2019s mind: \u201cBefore the rooster crows twice
 you will deny three times that you even know me.\u201d And he broke down and wept.","Pilate asked Jesus
 \u201cAre you the king of the Jews?\u201d Jesus replied
 \u201cYou have said it.\u201d","\u201cWould you like me to release to you this \u2018King of the Jews\u2019?\u201d Pilate asked.","Then at three o\u2019clock Jesus called out with a loud voice

 he exclaimed
 \u201cThis man truly was the Son of God!\u201d","Pilate couldn\u2019t believe that Jesus was already dead

 \u201cDon\u2019t be alarmed. You are looking for Jesus of Nazareth

 \u201cGo into all the world and preach the Good News to everyone.","Anyone who believes and is baptized will be saved. But anyone who refuses to believe will be condemned.","These miraculous signs will accompany those who believe: They will cast out demons in my name

 \u201cI want to. Be healed.\u201d ","He said to him
 \u201cTell no one about this. Go and let the religious leader of the Jews see you. Give the gifts Moses has told you to give when a man is healed of a disease. Let the leaders know you have been healed.\u201d ","When Jesus saw their faith
 He said to the sick man
 \u201cSon
 your sins are forgiven.\u201d ","At once Jesus knew the teachers of the Law were thinking this. He said to them
 \u201cWhy do you think this in your hearts? ","Which is easier to say to the sick man

 \u2018Get up
 take your bed

 \u201cPeople who are well do not need a doctor. Only those who are sick need a doctor. I have not come to call those who are right with God. I have come to call those who are sinners.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cCan the friends at a wedding go without food when the man just married is with them? As long as they have him with them
 they will not go without food. ","The days will come when the man just married will be taken from them. Then they will not eat food so they can pray better.","No man sews a piece of new cloth on an old coat. If it comes off
 it will make the hole bigger. ","No man puts new wine into old skin bags. The skin would break and the wine would run out. The bags would be no good. New wine must be put into new skin bags.\u201d","The proud religious law-keepers said to Jesus

 \u201cSee! My mother and My brothers! ","Whoever does what My Father wants is My brother and My sister and My mother.\u201d","He taught them many things by using picture-stories. As He taught
 He said
 ","\u201cListen! A man went out to plant seed.","As he planted the seed
 some fell by the side of the road. Birds came and ate them. ","Some seed fell among rocks. It came up at once because there was so little ground.","But it dried up when the sun was high in the sky because it had no root.","Some seed fell among thorns. The thorns grew and did not give the seed room to grow. This seed gave no grain.","Some seed fell on good ground. It came up and grew and gave much grain. Some gave thirty times as much grain. Some gave sixty times as much grain. Some gave one hundred times as much grain.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cYou have ears
 then listen!\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cYou were given the secrets about the holy nation of God. Everything is told in picture-stories to those who are outside the holy nation of God. ","They see
 but do not know what it means. They hear
 but do not understand. If they did
 they might turn to God and have their sins forgiven.\u201d (B)","Jesus said to them
 \u201cDo you not understand this picture-story? Then how will you understand any of the picture-stories? ","What the man plants is the Word of God.","Those by the side of the road are the ones who hear the Word. As soon as they hear it
 the devil comes and takes away the Word that is planted in their hearts. ","The seed that fell among rocks is like people who receive the Word with joy when they hear it.","Their roots are not deep so they live only a short time. When sorrow and trouble come because of the Word
 they give up and fall away. ","The seed that was planted among thorns is like some people who listen to the Word.","But the cares of this life let thorns come up. A love for riches and always wanting other things let thorns grow. These things do not give the Word room to grow so it does not give grain.","The seed that fell on good ground is like people who hear the Word and understand it. They give much grain. Some give thirty times as much grain. Some give sixty times as much grain. Some give one hundred times as much grain.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cIs a lamp to be put under a pail or under a bed? Should it not be put on a lamp-stand? ","Everything that is hidden will be brought into the light. Everything that is a secret will be made known.","You have ears
 then listen!\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cBe careful what you listen to. The same amount you give will be given to you
 and even more. ","He who has
 to him will be given. To him who does not have
 even the little he has will be taken from him.\u201d","He said
 \u201cThe holy nation of God is like a man who plants seed in the ground. ","He goes to sleep every night and gets up every day. The seed grows
 but he does not know how. ","The earth gives fruit by itself. The leaf comes first and then the young grain can be seen. And last
 the grain is ready to gather. ","As soon as the grain is ready
 he cuts it. The time of gathering the grain has come.\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cIn what way can we show what the holy nation of God is like? Or what picture-story can we use to help you understand? ","It is like a grain of mustard seed that is planted in the ground. It is the smallest of all seeds.","After it is put in the ground
 it grows and becomes the largest of the spices. It puts out long branches so birds of the sky can live in it.\u201d ","It was evening of that same day. Jesus said to them
 \u201cLet us go over to the other side.\u201d ","He got up and spoke sharp words to the wind. He said to the sea
 \u201cBe quiet! Be still.\u201d At once the wind stopped blowing. There were no more waves. ","He said to His followers
 \u201cWhy are you so full of fear? Do you not have faith?\u201d ","At the same time
 Jesus was saying
 \u201cCome out of the man

 \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d He said
 \u201cMy name is Many

 \u201cGo home to your own people. Tell them what great things the Lord has done for you. Tell them how He had pity on you.\u201d ","For she said to herself
 \u201cIf I can only touch His coat
 I will be healed.\u201d ","His followers said to Him
 \u201cYou see the many people pushing on every side. Why do You ask
 \u2018Who touched My coat?\u2019\u201d ","He said to her
 \u201cDaughter
 your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be free from your sickness.\u201d ","Jesus heard this. He said to the leader of the Jewish place of worship
 \u201cDo not be afraid
 just believe.\u201d ","He went in and asked them
 \u201cWhy is there so much noise and crying? The girl is not dead. She is sleeping.\u201d","He took the girl by the hand and said
 \u201cLittle girl
 I say to you
 get up!\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cOne who speaks for God is respected everywhere but in his own country and among his own family and in his own house.\u201d ","Jesus called the twelve followers to Him and began to send them out two by two. He gave them power over demons.","He said to them
 \u201cWhatever house you go into
 stay there until you leave that town. ","Whoever does not take you in or listen to you
 when you leave there
 shake the dust off your feet. By doing that
 you will speak against them. For sure

 it will be easier for the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah on the day men stand before God and are judged than for that city.\u201d ","When Herod heard this
 he said
 \u201cIt is John the Baptist

 \u201cAsk me for whatever you want and I will give it to you.\u201d ","She went to her mother and asked
 \u201cWhat should I ask for?\u201d The mother answered
 \u201cI want the head of John the Baptist.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cCome away from the people. Be by yourselves and rest.\u201d There were many people coming and going. They had had no time even to eat. ","He said to them
 \u201cGive them something to eat.\u201d They said to Him
 \u201cAre we to go and buy many loaves of bread and give it to them?\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cHow many loaves of bread do you have here? Go and see.\u201d When they knew
 they said
 \u201cFive loaves of bread and two fish.\u201d ","For they all saw Him and were afraid. At once Jesus talked to them. He said
 \u201cTake hope. It is I

 \u201cDo you not understand yet? Do you not understand that whatever goes into a man cannot make him sinful? ","It does not go into his heart
 but into his stomach and then on out of his body.\u201d In this way
 He was saying that all food is clean. ","He said
 \u201cWhatever comes out of a man is what makes the man sinful. ","From the inside
 out of the heart of men come bad thoughts

 \u201cDo not stop him. No one who does a powerful work in My name can say anything bad about Me soon after. ","The person who is not against us is for us.","For sure
 I tell you
 whoever gives you a cup of water to drink in My name because you belong to Christ will not lose his reward from God. ","Whoever is the reason for one of these little ones who believes in Me to sin
 it would be better for him to have a large stone put around his neck and to be thrown into the sea. ","If your hand is the reason you fall into sin
 cut it off. It is better to go into life without a hand
 than to have two hands and go into the fire of hell that cannot be put out. ","If your foot is the reason you fall into sin
 cut it off. It is better to go into life with only one foot
 than to have two feet and go into the fire of hell that cannot be put out. ","If your eye is the reason you fall into sin
 take it out. It is better to go into the holy nation of God with only one eye
 than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. ","There is where their worm never dies and the fire is never put out.","\u201cEveryone will be made cleaner and stronger with fire.","Salt is good. But if salt loses its taste
 how can it be made to taste like salt again? Have salt in yourselves and be at peace with each other.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cWhat did the Law of Moses say?\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cBecause of your hard hearts
 Moses gave you this Law. ","From the beginning of the world

 a man is to leave his father and mother and is to live with his wife. ","The two will become one. So they are no longer two
 but one. ","Let no man divide what God has put together.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cWhoever divorces his wife and marries another is not faithful to her and is guilty of a sex sin. ","If a woman divorces her husband and marries another
 she is not faithful to her husband and is guilty of a sex sin.\u201d","Jesus saw this and was angry with the followers. He said
 \u201cLet the little children come to Me. Do not stop them. The holy nation of God is made up of ones like these. ","For sure
 I tell you
 whoever does not receive the holy nation of God as a little child does not go into it.\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cWhy do you call Me good? There is only One Who is good. That is God. ","You know the Laws
 \u2018Do not be guilty of sex sins in marriage. Do not kill another person. Do not take things from people in wrong ways. Do not steal. Do not lie. Respect your father and mother.\u2019\u201d ","The man said to Jesus
 \u201cTeacher
 I have obeyed all these Laws since I was a boy.\u201d ","Jesus looked at him with love and said
 \u201cThere is one thing for you to do yet. Go and sell everything you have and give the money to poor people. You will have riches in heaven. Then come and follow Me.\u201d ","Jesus looked around Him. He said to His followers
 \u201cHow hard it is for rich people to get into the holy nation of God!\u201d ","The followers were surprised and wondered about His words. But Jesus said to them again
 \u201cChildren! How hard it is for those who put their trust in riches to get into the holy nation of God! ","It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to go to heaven.\u201d","They were very surprised and wondered

 \u201cFor sure
 I tell you
 there are those who have given up houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands because of Me
 and the Good News. ","They will get back one hundred times as much now at this time in houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands. Along with this
 they will have very much trouble. And they will have life that lasts forever in the world to come. ","Many who are first will be last. Many who are last will be first.\u201d","He said
 \u201cListen
 we are going to Jerusalem. The Son of Man will be handed over to the religious leaders of the Jews and to the teachers of the Law. They will say that He must be put to death.

 \u201cYou do not know what you ask. Can you take the suffering I am about to take? Can you be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?\u201d ","They said to Him
 \u201cYes
 we can.\u201d Jesus said to them
 \u201cYou will

 \u2018This is the one who will get everything when the owner dies. Let us kill him and we will get everything.\u2019 ","They took him and killed him. They threw his body outside the field.","What will the owner of the field do? He will come and kill the farmers. He will give the field to other farmers.","\u201cHave you not read what the Holy Writings say? \u2018The Stone that was put aside by the workmen has become the most important Stone in the corner of the building.","The Lord has done this.

 \u201cFor sure

 this poor woman whose husband has died has given more money than all the others. ","They all gave of that which was more than they needed for their own living. She is poor and yet she gave all she had
 even what she needed for her own living.\u201d","Jesus went out of the house of God. One of His followers said to Him

 \u201cDo you see these great buildings? All these stones will be thrown down. Not one will be left standing on another.\u201d","Jesus began to say to them

 do not be surprised. These things have to happen. But the end is not yet. ","Nations will have wars with other nations. Countries will fight against countries. The earth will shake and break apart in different places. There will be no food for people. There will be much trouble. These things are the beginning of much sorrow and pain.","\u201cWatch out for yourselves. They will take you to the courts. In the places of worship they will beat you.

 no life would have been saved. Because of God\u2019s people whom He has chosen
 He made the days short.","\u201cIf anyone says to you
 \u2018See! Here is the Christ
\u2019 or
 \u2018There He is!\u2019 do not believe it. ","Some will come who will say they are Christ. False preachers will come. These people will do special things for people to see. They will do surprising things

 God\u2019s people will be led to believe something wrong. ","See! I have told you about these things before they happen.","\u201cAfter those days of much trouble and pain and sorrow are over
 the sun will get dark. The moon will not give light. ","The stars will fall from the sky.

 All the people are searching for you. ","He said to them
 Let us go into the next towns so that I can preach there also; for truly
 I came out for that purpose.","And Jesus had compassion on him
 and put forth his hand
 touched him
 and said to him
 I will; be clean. ","and said to him
 See that you say nothing to anyone
 but go and show yourself to the priest
 and offer for your cleansing those things that Moses commanded
 for a testimony to them.","When Jesus saw their faith
 he said to the paralytic
 Son
 your sins are forgiven you.","And immediately
 when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so questioned in themselves

 Why do you think such things in your hearts? ","Which is easier to say to the paralytic: Your sins are forgiven you
 or to say
 Arise
 take up your bed and walk? ","But so that you may know that the Son of man has power in earth to forgive sins\u2013 He spoke to the paralytic:","I say to you
 arise
 and take up your bed
 and go your way into your own house. ","And as Jesus was passing by
 he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom and said to him
 Follow me. And he arose and followed him.","When Jesus heard that
 he said to them
 The whole have no need of the physician

 but sinners to repentance.","And Jesus said to them
 Can the children of a wedding fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them
 they cannot fast. ","But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them
 and then they will fast
 in those days. ","Also
 no one sows a piece of new cloth onto an old garment
 because then the new piece pulls away from the old
 and the tear is worse. ","Likewise
 no one pours new wine into old wineskins
 for if he does
 the new wine bursts the skins
 and the wine runs out and the vessels are marred. But new wine must be poured into new vessels.","And the Pharisees said to him
 Look
 why are they doing on the Sabbath days that which is not lawful?","And he said to them
 Have you never read what David did when he had need and was hungry
 both he and those who were with him? ","And he said to them
 The Sabbath was made for man
 and not man for the Sabbath. ","Therefore the Son of man is Lord even of the Sabbath day.","And he said to the man who had the withered hand
 Arise
 and stand in the midst. ","And he said to them
 Is it lawful to do a good deed on the Sabbath days
 or an evil deed? To save life
 or to kill? But they held their peace. ","And he looked round about on them angrily
 mourning the blindness of their hearts

 Stretch forth your hand. And he stretched it out
 and his hand was restored fully as whole as the other.","And Jesus called them to him and spoke to them in similitudes: How can Satan drive out Satan?","For if a realm is divided against itself
 that realm cannot endure. ","Or if a house is divided against itself
 that house cannot continue. ","So if Satan makes insurrection against himself and is divided
 he cannot continue
 but is at an end. ","No one can enter into a strong man\u2019s house and take away his goods unless he first binds the strong man

 Behold my mother and my brethren. ","For whosoever does the will of God

 there went out a sower to sow. ","And it happened as he sowed that some seed fell by the wayside
 and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up. ","Some fell on stony ground
 where it had not much earth
 and quickly sprang up because it did not have depth of earth; ","but as soon as the sun was up
 it caught heat
 and because it did not have rooting
 withered away. ","And some fell among the thorns
 and the thorns grew up and choked it
 so that it gave no fruit. ","And some fell upon good ground
 and yielded fruit that sprang up and grew
 and brought forth: some thirtyfold
 some sixtyfold
 and some a hundredfold. ","And he said to them
 He who has ears to hear
 let him hear.","And he said to them
 To you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God. But to those who are outside
 all things shall be done in similitudes
 ","and when they see
 they will see but not discern
 and when they hear
 they will hear and not understand
 lest at any time they should turn; and their sins would be forgiven them.","And he said to them
 Do you not understand this similitude? How then will you understand any other similitudes? ","The sower sows the word.","And those who are by the wayside where the word is sown are those to whom
 as soon as they have heard it
 Satan comes immediately
 and takes away the word that was sown in their hearts. ","And likewise
 those who receive the seed on the stony ground are those who
 when they have heard the word
 at once receive it with gladness
 ","yet have no roots in themselves. And so they endure but a time
 and once trouble and persecution arise for the word\u2019s sake
 they fall immediately. ","And those who receive the seed among the thorns are such as hear the word
 ","but the care of this world
 and the deceitfulness of riches
 and the hunger for other things
 enter in and choke the word
 and it is made unfruitful. ","And those who received the seed in good ground are those who hear the word and receive it
 and bring forth fruit: some thirtyfold
 some sixtyfold
 some a hundredfold.","And Jesus said to the people
 Is the candle lighted to be put under a bushel or under the table
 and not rather to be put on a candlestick? ","For there is nothing so hid that it will not be revealed
 nor so secret but that it may become clear. ","If any person has ears to hear
 let him hear.","And he said to them
 Attend with care to what you hear. With the same measure you give
 it will be measured back to you. And to you who hear
 more will be given. ","For to him who has
 it will be given
 but from him who has not shall be taken away even what he has.","And he said
 The kingdom of God is like this: it is as if a man sows seed in the ground
 ","and sleeps
 and rises up night and day
 and the seed sprouts and grows up
 he knows not how. ","For the earth brings forth fruit of herself: first the blade
 then the ears
 after that the full grain in the ears. ","And as soon as the fruit is brought forth
 immediately the man thrusts in the sickle
 because the harvest has come.","And he said
 To what may we liken the kingdom of God? or what comparison can we use? ","It is like a grain of mustard seed
 which
 when it is sown in the earth
 is the least of all seeds that are in the earth. ","But after it is sown
 it grows up and is greatest of all shrubs
 and bears great branches
 so that the birds of the air may dwell under the cover of it.","And the same day
 when evening was come
 he said to them
 Let us pass over to the other side. ","And he rose up and rebuked the wind
 and said to the sea
 Peace
 and be still! And the wind allayed
 and there followed a great calm. ","And he said to them
 Why are you so fearful? How is it that you have no faith? ","For Jesus had said to him
 Come out of the man
 you foul spirit! ","And Jesus asked him
 What is your name? He answered
 saying
 My name is Legion
 for we are many. ","However Jesus would not allow him
 but said to him
 Go home to your own house and to your friends
 and show them what great things the Lord has done for you
 and how he had compassion on you.","For she thought
 If I can but touch his clothes
 I shall be healed. ","And his disciples said to him
 You see the people thronging you
 and yet you ask
 Who touched me?","And he said to her
 Daughter
 your faith has made you whole. Go in peace
 and be healed of your affliction.","As soon as Jesus heard that word spoken
 he said to the leader of the synagogue
 Be not afraid; only believe.","and went in and said to them
 Why do you make this ado
 and weep? The maiden is not dead
 but sleeping. ","He took the maiden by the hand and said to her
 Tabitha
 cumi! which translated is
 Child
 I say to you
 arise. ","And Jesus said to them
 A prophet is not without honour but in his own country
 and among his own kin
 and among those who are of the same household. ","And he called the twelve and began to send them out two by two
 and gave them power over unclean spirits. ","And he said to them
 Wherever you enter into a house
 stay there till you move on from that town. ","And whoever does not receive you or hear you
 when you leave there
 shake off the dust that is under your feet
 for a witness to them. I say truly to you
 it will be easier for Sodom and Gomorrah at the day of judgment than for that place.","But when Herod heard of him
 he said
 It is John whom I beheaded: he has risen back up from death.","And the daughter of the said Herodias came in and danced
 and pleased Herod and those who sat with him. Then the king said to the maiden
 Ask of me what you will
 and I will give it to you. ","And she went out and said to her mother
 What should I ask for? And she said
 The head of John the Baptist. ","And he said to them
 Come apart into the countryside and rest awhile. For there were so many comers and goers that they had no time so much as to eat. ","He answered and said to them
 You give them to eat. And they said to him
 Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread and give them to eat? ","He said to them
 How many loaves do you have? Go and look. And when they had searched
 they said
 Five
 and two fishes.","For they all saw him and were afraid. And immediately he spoke to them and said to them
 Be of good cheer
 it is I. Be not afraid. ","He answered and said to them
 Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites
 as it is written: This people honours me with their lips
 but their heart is far from me. ","In vain they worship me
 teaching doctrines which are nothing but the commandments of men. ","For you lay the commandment of God aside
 and observe the precepts of men
 such as the washing of pitchers and of cups. And many other suchlike things you do.","And he said to them
 All too well do you cast aside the commandment of God to maintain your own precepts. ","For Moses said
 Honour your father and your mother
 and whosoever curses father or mother
 let him die for it. ","But you say a man should say to father or mother
 Corban
 which is
 What you ask me for
 to help you with
 is dedicated to God. ","And so you no longer let him do anything for his father or his mother
 ","making the word of God of no effect through your own precepts
 which you have established. And many such things you do.","And he called all the people to him and said to them
 Hearken unto me
 every one of you
 and understand. ","There is nothing outside a man that can defile him when it enters into him. But those things that proceed out of him are the things that defile a man.","And he said to them
 Are you also without understanding? Do you not yet perceive that whatever thing from without enters into a person
 it cannot defile him
 ","because it enters not into his heart
 but into the stomach
 and goes out into the drain that carries away all foods?","And he said
 What defiles a man is that which comes out of a man. ","For from within
 namely out of the heart of men
 proceed evil thoughts: adultery
 fornication
 murder
 ","theft
 covetousness
 wickedness
 deceit
 uncleanness
 a wicked eye
 slander
 pride
 foolishness. ","All these evil things come from within
 and defile a person.","And Jesus said to her
 Let the children first be fed. For it is not meet to take the children\u2019s bread and cast it to dogs. ","And he said to her
 For this saying
 go your way; the devil has gone out of your daughter. ","and looked up to heaven and sighed
 and said to him
 Ephatha; that is to say
 Be opened. ","In the days when there was a great multitude
 and they had nothing to eat
 Jesus called his disciples to him and said to them
 ","I have compassion on this people
 because they have now been with me three days
 and have nothing to eat. ","And if I send them away to their own houses without eating
 they might faint on the way
 because some of them have come from far. ","And he asked them
 How many loaves do you have? They said
 Seven.","And he sighed in his spirit and said
 Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly I say to you
 there will be no sign given to this generation.","And he charged them
 saying
 Take heed
 and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees
 and of the leaven of Herod. ","And when Jesus knew this
 he said to them
 Why are you troubled because you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive or understand? Are your hearts still blinded? ","Do you have eyes
 but not see? And do you have ears
 and not hear? Do you not remember? ","When I broke five loaves among five thousand
 how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up? They said to him
 Twelve.","When I broke seven among four thousand
 how many baskets of the leftover fragments did you take up? They said
 Seven.","And he said to them
 How is it that you do not understand?","And he took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the town
 and spat in his eyes
 and put his hands upon him
 and asked him whether he could see anything. ","And Jesus sent him home to his house
 saying
 Do not go into the town
 nor tell anyone in town about this.","And Jesus went out with his disciples into the towns around the city called Caesarea Philippi. And on the way he asked his disciples
 saying
 Who do people say that I am? ","And he said to them
 But who do you say that I am? Peter answered and said to him
 You are the Christ. ","Then he turned around and looked on his disciples
 and rebuked Peter
 saying
 Get behind me
 Satan
 for you savour not the things of God
 but the things of men.","And he called the people to him with his disciples also
 and said to them
 Whoever would follow me
 let him deny himself
 and take up his cross and follow me. ","For whoever would save his life
 will lose it. But whoever loses his life for my sake and the sake of the gospel
 shall save it. ","What does it profit a man
 if he should win all the world and lose his own soul? ","Or what can a person give to redeem his soul?","Whosoever therefore is ashamed of me and of my words among this adulterous and sinful generation
 of him will the Son of man be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.","And he said to them
 Truly I say to you
 there are some standing here who will not taste of death till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power.","And Peter spoke and said to Jesus
 Rabbi
 it is good for us to be here. Let us make three tabernacles: one for you
 one for Moses
 and one for Elijah. ","He answered and said to them
 Indeed
 Elijah does first come
 and restore all things. And also the Son of man
 as it is written
 will suffer many things
 and will be rejected. ","Moreover I say to you that Elijah has come
 and they have done to him whatsoever pleased them
 as it is written of him.","And he said to the scribes
 What are you disputing with them? ","Jesus answered him and said
 O generation without faith
 how long shall I be with you? How long shall I suffer you? Bring him to me. ","And Jesus asked his father
 How long has this been happening to him? And he said
 Since childhood. ","And Jesus said to him
 If you can believe
 all things are possible to him who believes. ","When Jesus saw that the people came running to gather to him
 he rebuked the foul spirit
 saying to him
 Deaf and dumb spirit
 I charge you to come out of him
 and enter no more into him! ","And he said to them
 This kind can come out no other way but by prayer and fasting.","because he was teaching his disciples. And he said to them
 The Son of man will be delivered into the hands of men
 and they will kill him. And after he has been killed
 he will arise again on the third day. ","And they came to Capernaum. And once he was indoors
 he asked them
 What was it that you were disputing between yourselves along the way? ","And he sat down and called the twelve to him and said to them
 If any man desires to be first
 let him be last of all
 and servant to all. ","And he took a child and set him in the midst of them
 and took him in his arms and said to them
 ","But Jesus said
 Do not forbid him. For no one who does a miracle in my name can lightly speak evil of me. ","Whosoever is not against you
 is on your side.","And whosoever gives you a cup of water to drink for my name\u2019s sake
 because you belong to Christ
 truly I say to you
 he will not lose his reward. ","But whoever hurts one of these little ones that believe in me
 it would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were cast into the sea. ","Therefore if your hand causes you to offend
 cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life maimed than
 having two hands
 to go into hell
 into fire that never shall be quenched
 ","Likewise
 if your foot causes you to offend
 cut it off. For it is better for you to go lame into life than
 having two feet
 to be cast into hell
 into fire that never shall be quenched
 ","So also if your eye causes you to offend
 tear it out. It is better for you to go into the kingdom of God with one eye than
 having two eyes
 to be cast into hell fire
 ","where their worm dies not and the fire never goes out.","Every man therefore must be salted with fire. And every sacrifice must be seasoned with salt.","Salt is good. But if the salt is unsavoury
 what can you salt with it? See that you have salt in yourselves. And have peace among yourselves
 one with another.","And he answered and said to them
 What did Moses tell you to do? ","And Jesus answered and said to them
 For the hardness of your hearts he wrote this precept for you. ","But at the first creation
 God made them man and woman. ","And for the sake of this
 a man must leave his father and mother and abide by his wife
 ","and the two shall be one flesh. So then they are now not two
 but are one flesh. ","Therefore what God has joined together
 let not man separate.","And he said to them
 Whoever puts away his wife and marries another
 breaks wedlock to her. ","And if a woman forsakes her husband and is married to another
 she commits adultery.","When Jesus saw that
 he was displeased
 and said to them
 Suffer the children to come to me
 and forbid them not. For of such is the kingdom of God. ","Truly I say to you
 whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child
 he shall not enter therein. ","Jesus said to him
 Why do you call me good? There is none good but one
 who is God. ","You know the commandments: do not break matrimony
 do not kill
 do not steal
 bear no false witness
 defraud no man
 honour your father and mother. ","He answered and said to him
 Teacher
 all these I have observed from my youth.","Jesus regarded him with favour and said to him
 One thing is lacking to you. Go and sell all that you have
 and give to the poor
 and you will have treasure in heaven. And come and follow me
 and take up the cross.","And Jesus looked round about and said to his disciples
 What a hard thing it is for those who have riches to enter into the kingdom of God. ","And his disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus spoke again and said to them
 Children
 how hard is it for those who trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God? ","It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.","And they were astonished out of measure
 saying between themselves
 Who then can be saved? ","Jesus looked upon them and said
 With men it is impossible
 but not with God. For with God
 all things are possible.","Jesus answered and said
 Truly I say to you
 there is no one who gives up house
 or brethren
 or sisters
 or father
 or mother
 or wife
 or children
 or lands
 for my sake and the gospel\u2019s
 ","who will not receive a hundredfold now in this life: houses and brethren and sisters and mothers and children and lands \u2013 with persecutions \u2013 and in the world to come
 eternal life. ","But many that are first will be last
 and the last
 first.","Behold
 we are going up to Jerusalem
 and the Son of man will be delivered to the high priests and to the scribes. And they will condemn him to death
 and will deliver him to the Gentiles. ","And they will mock him
 and scourge him
 and spit upon him
 and kill him. And the third day he will rise again.","And then James and John
 the sons of Zebedee
 came to him
 saying
 Teacher
 we would like you to do for us whatever we ask. ","He said to them
 What would you like me to do for you? ","But Jesus said to them
 You know not what you ask. Can you drink of the cup that I must drink of
 and be baptized in the baptism that I must be baptized in? ","And they said to him
 That we can. Jesus said to them
 You will drink of the cup that I will drink of
 and be baptized with the baptism that I will be baptized in. ","But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give
 but is for them for whom it is prepared.","But Jesus called them to him and said to them
 You know that those who are seen to bear rule among the Gentiles reign as lords over them. And those who are great among them exercise authority over them. ","It shall not be this way among you
 but whoever would be great among you shall minister to you
 ","and whoever would be chief shall be servant to all.","For even the Son of man came not to be served
 but to serve
 and to give his life for the redemption of many.","And Jesus stood still and directed that he be called. And they called the blind man
 saying to him
 Be of good comfort. Rise
 he has called you.","And Jesus spoke and said to him
 What do you want me to do for you? The blind man said to him
 Teacher
 that I could see! ","Jesus said to him
 Go your way; your faith has saved you.","and said to them
 Go your ways into the town that is in front of you. And as soon as you have entered into it
 you will find a colt tied
 on which no man ever sat. Untie him and bring him here. ","And if anyone asks you why you are doing this
 say that the Lord has need of him
 and straightaway he will send him here.","And Jesus spoke and said to it
 Never may man eat fruit from you hereafter while the world stands. And his disciples heard it.","And he taught
 saying to them
 Is it not written: My house shall be called the house of prayer for all nations? But you have made it a den of thieves! ","And Jesus answered and said to them
 Have confidence in God. ","Truly I say to you that whoever says to this mountain
 Take yourself away and cast yourself into the sea
 and who does not waver in his heart
 but believes that those things which he says will come to pass \u2013 whatever he says will be done for him. ","Therefore I say to you
 whatever you ask when you pray
 believe that you will have it
 and it will be done for you. ","And when you stand and pray
 forgive
 if you have anything against any person
 so that your Father who is in heaven may also forgive you your trespasses. ","Jesus answered and said to them
 I will also ask of you a certain thing. Answer me
 and I will tell you by what authority I do these things. ","The baptism of John: was it from heaven
 or of men? Answer me.","And they answered and said to Jesus
 We don\u2019t know. And Jesus answered and said to them
 Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.","And he began to speak to them in similitudes: A certain man planted a vineyard
 and compassed it about with a hedge
 and made a winepress
 and built a tower in it. And he let it out on hire to husbandmen
 and went into a far country. ","And when the time came
 he sent a servant to the tenants
 in order to receive from the tenants some of the fruit of the vineyard. ","And they caught him and beat him
 and sent him back empty-handed. ","And moreover he sent to them another servant
 and at him they cast stones
 and wounded him in the head
 and sent him back utterly reviled. ","And again he sent another
 and him they killed; and many others
 beating some and killing some.","He had yet one son
 whom he loved tenderly. Him also he sent to them at the last
 saying
 They will respect my son. ","But the tenants said amongst themselves
 This is the heir; come
 let us kill him
 and the inheritance will be ours. ","And they took him and killed him
 and cast him out of the vineyard.","What then will the lord of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the tenants
 and let out the vineyard to others. ","Have you not read this scripture: The stone which the builders refused is made the chief stone in the corner;","this was done by the Lord
 and is marvellous in our eyes?","And they sent to him certain of the Pharisees
 along with Herod\u2019s servants
 to take him in his words. ","Ought we to give
 or ought we not to give?","And they brought one. And he said to them
 Whose image and superscription is this? And they said to him
 Caesar\u2019s. ","And Jesus answered and said to them
 Then give to Caesar that which belongs to Caesar
 and to God that which belongs to God. And they marvelled at him.","Jesus answered and said to them
 Are you not therefore deceived
 and do not understand the scriptures
 nor the power of God? ","For when they rise again from death
 people neither marry nor are married
 but are as the angels who are in heaven. ","And concerning the dead
 that they will rise again
 have you not read in the book of Moses how in the bush God spoke to him
 saying
 I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob? ","He is not the God of the dead
 but the God of the living. You are therefore greatly deceived.","And there came one of the scribes who had heard them disputing together. He perceived that Jesus had answered them well
 and asked him
 Which is the first of all the commandments?","Jesus answered him
 The first of all the commandments is: Hear
 O Israel
 the Lord God is one Lord. ","And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart
 and with all your soul
 and with all your mind
 and with all your strength. This is the first commandment. ","And the second is like it: You shall love your neighbour as yourself. There is no commandment greater than these.","And when Jesus saw that he answered wisely
 he said to him
 You are not far from the kingdom of God.","And Jesus spoke and said
 teaching in the temple
 How is it the scribes say that Christ is the son of David? ","For David himself
 inspired with the Holy Spirit
 said
 The Lord said to my Lord
 sit on my right hand until I make your enemies your footstool. ","So David himself calls him Lord. By what means then is he David\u2019s son?","And he said to them in his doctrine
 Beware of the scribes
 who love to go about in long clothing
 and love salutations in the market places
 ","and the chief seats in the synagogues
 and to sit in the uppermost places at feasts; ","and who devour widows\u2019 houses
 and that under a colour of long praying. These shall receive greater damnation.","And he called his disciples to him and said to them
 Truly I say to you that this poor widow has cast in more than all the others who have cast into the treasury. ","For they all gave from their surplus
 but she
 in her poverty
 did cast in all that she had
 even all her living.","And as he went out of the temple
 one of his disciples said to him
 Teacher
 see what stones and what buildings are here! ","And Jesus answered and said to him
 Do you see these great buildings? There will not be left one stone upon another that will not be thrown down.","And Jesus answered them and began
 saying
 Take heed
 lest anyone deceive you. ","For many will come in my name saying
 I am Christ
 and will deceive many.","When you hear of war and reports of war
 do not be troubled. For such things must be. But the end is not yet. ","For nation will arise against nation
 and kingdom against kingdom. And there will be earthquakes in all quarters
 and famines and troubles. These are the beginning of sorrows.","But take heed to yourselves. For they will bring you up before the councils and into the synagogues
 and you will be beaten; yea
 and will be brought before rulers and kings for my sake
 for a testimony to them. ","And the gospel must first be preached among all nations.","But when they lead you and present you
 do not be anxious about what you will say
 nor prepare ahead. But whatever is given you at that same time
 that speak. For it will not be you who speak
 but the Holy Spirit.","Yea and brother will deliver brother to death
 and the father the son; and the children will rise against their fathers and mothers
 and will put them to death. ","And you will be hated by all men for my name\u2019s sake. But whosoever endures to the end
 the same shall be saved.","Moreover
 when you see the abomination that betokens desolation
 of which Daniel the prophet has spoken
 standing where it ought not
 let him who reads
 understand. Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. ","And let him who is on the housetop not descend down into the house
 neither enter in to fetch anything out of his house. ","And let him who is in the field not turn back again to those things that he left behind him
 to take his clothes with him. ","Woe shall be then to women that are with child
 and to them that give suck in those days. ","But pray that your flight be not in the winter.","For there shall be in those days such tribulation as was not from the beginning of creatures that God created to this time
 nor will be again. ","And if the Lord did not shorten those days
 no one would be saved. But for the sake of the elect
 whom he has chosen
 he has shortened those days.","And then if anyone says to you
 Lo
 here is Christ! Lo
 he is there! \u2013\u00a0 believe it not. ","For false Christs will arise
 and false prophets
 and they will show miracles and wonders
 to deceive if it were possible even the elect. ","But take heed: behold
 I have told you all things beforehand.","Moreover in those days
 after that tribulation
 the sun will grow dark
 and the moon will not give her light
 ","and the stars of heaven will fall; and the powers which are in heaven shall move.","And then will they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.","And then he will send his angels
 and will gather together his elect from the four winds
 and from one end of the world to the other.","Learn from a similitude of the fig tree. When its branches are yet tender and it has brought forth leaves
 you know that summer is near. ","So also in like manner
 when you see these things come to pass
 understand that it is near
 even at the doors. ","Truly I say to you that this generation will not pass till all these things be done.","Heaven and earth shall pass
 but my words will not pass. ","But of that day and hour no one knows
 no
 not the angels who are in heaven
 nor the Son himself
 but the Father only. ","Take heed. Watch and pray
 for you know not when the time is. ","It is as a man who has gone into a far country
 and has left his house
 and given authority to his servants
 and to each his work
 and instructed the porter to watch.","Watch therefore. For you know not when the master of the house will come \u2013 whether at evening or midnight
 whether at the cock-crowing or in the dawning \u2013 ","lest
 if he come suddenly
 he should find you sleeping. ","And what I say to you
 I say to all: Watch!","And there were some who were displeased in themselves and said
 Why this waste of oyntment? ","And Jesus said
 Let her be in rest. Why do you trouble her? She has done a good work on me. ","For you will have the poor with you always
 and whenever you wish
 you may do them good. But me you will not have always. ","She has done what she could: she came beforehand to anoint my body for the burial.","Truly I say to you
 wherever this gospel is preached throughout the whole world
 this also that she has done will be told
 in remembrance of her.","And he sent forth two of his disciples and said to them
 Go into the city
 and there a man will meet you bearing a pitcher of water. Follow him. ","And wherever he goes in
 say to the head of the house
 The Teacher asks
 Where is the guest chamber where I may eat the Passover lamb with my disciples? ","And he will show you a large upper room furnished and prepared: there make ready for us.","And as they sat at the table and ate
 Jesus said
 Truly I say to you that one of you who eats with me will betray me. ","He answered and said to them
 It is one of the twelve
 and the same dips with me in the platter. ","The Son of man goes as it is written of him. But woe is to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed. It would have been good for that man if he had never been born.","And as they ate
 Jesus took bread
 blessed
 and broke
 and gave to them and said
 Take
 eat; this is my body. ","And he said to them
 This is my blood of the new testament
 which is shed for many. ","Truly I say to you
 I will drink no more of this fruit of the vine until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God.","And Jesus said to them
 All of you will fall away because of me this night. For it is written: I will smite the shepherd
 and the sheep will be scattered. ","But after I am risen up again
 I will go into Galilee ahead of you. ","And Jesus said to him
 Truly I say to you
 this day \u2013 even this night
 before the cock crows twice \u2013 you will deny me three times. ","And they came to a place named Gethsemane. And he said to his disciples
 Sit here
 while I go apart and pray. ","and said to them
 My soul is very heavy
 even to the death. You stay here and watch. ","And he said
 Abba
 Father
 all things are possible to you; take away this cup from me. Nevertheless
 not what I will
 but what you will
 be done.","And he came and found them sleeping and said to Peter
 Simon
 are you sleeping? Could not you watch with me one hour? ","Watch and pray
 lest you enter into temptation. The spirit is ready
 but the flesh is weak.","And he came the third time
 and said to them
 Sleep on now
 and take your ease! It is enough. The hour has come. Behold
 the Son of man will be delivered into the hands of sinners. ","Rise up
 let us go. Lo
 he who betrays me is at hand.","And Jesus spoke and said to them
 You have come out as if to a thief
 with swords and with clubs to capture me. ","I was daily with you in the temple teaching
 and you did not take me. But the scriptures must be fulfilled.","And Jesus said
 I am; and you will see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power and coming in the clouds of heaven.","And some began to spit at him
 and to cover his face
 and to beat him with fists
 and to say to him
 Prophesy to us! And the servants struck him on the face.","And again the cock crew. And Peter remembered the word that Jesus had said to him \u2013 before the cock crows twice
 you will deny me three times \u2013 and he began to weep.","And Pilate asked him
 Are you the king of the Jews? And he answered and said to him
 It is as you say. ","Pilate answered them and said
 Do you want me to release to you the king of the Jews? ","And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice
 saying
 Eloi
 Eloi
 lama sabachthani? which is
 if it be translated
 My God
 my God
 why have you forsaken me?","And when the centurion who stood before Jesus saw that he so cried out and gave up the spirit
 he said
 Truly this man was the Son of God.","And Pilate marvelled that he was already dead
 and called for the centurion
 and asked him if Jesus was already dead. ","And they said to one another
 Who will roll the stone away from the opening of the sepulchre for us? ","But he said to them
 Do not be afraid. You seek Jesus of Nazareth
 who was crucified. He is risen; he is not here. Behold the place where they put him. ","And he said to them
 Go into all the world
 and preach the glad tidings to all creatures. ","He who believes and is baptized will be saved
 but he who does not believe will be damned. ","And these signs will follow those who believe: in my name they will cast out devils
 and will speak with new tongues
 ","and will kill serpents. And if they drink any deadly thing
 it will not hurt them. They will lay their hands on the sick
 and they will recover.","This is the beginning of the Good News about Yeshua Christ
 the Son of God.","He said
 \u201cThe time has come
 and the kingdom of God is near. Change the way you think and act
 and believe the Good News.\u201d","Yeshua said to them
 \u201cCome
 follow me! I will teach you how to catch people instead of fish.\u201d ","Yeshua ordered the spirit
 \u201cKeep quiet
 and come out of him!\u201d ","When they found him
 they told him
 \u201cEveryone is looking for you.\u201d","Yeshua said to them
 \u201cLet\u2019s go somewhere else
 to the small towns that are nearby. I have to spread the Good News in them also. This is why I have come.\u201d","Yeshua felt sorry for him
 reached out
 touched him
 and said
 \u201cI\u2019m willing. So be clean!\u201d","\u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone about this! Instead
 show yourself to the priest. Then offer the sacrifices which Moses commanded as proof to people that you are clean.\u201d","When Yeshua saw their faith
 he said to the man
 \u201cFriend
 your sins are forgiven.\u201d","At once
 Yeshua knew inwardly what they were thinking. He asked them
 \u201cWhy do you have these thoughts? ","Is it easier to say to this paralyzed man
 \u2018Your sins are forgiven
\u2019 or to say
 \u2018Get up
 pick up your cot
 and walk\u2019? ","I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.\u201d Then he said to the paralyzed man
 ","\u201cI\u2019m telling you to get up
 pick up your cot
 and go home!\u201d","When Yeshua was leaving
 he saw Levi
 son of Alphaeus
 sitting in a tax office. Yeshua said to him
 \u201cFollow me!\u201d So Levi got up and followed him.","When Yeshua heard that
 he said to them
 \u201cHealthy people don\u2019t need a doctor; those who are sick do. I\u2019ve come to call sinners
 not people who think they have God\u2019s approval.\u201d","Yeshua replied
 \u201cCan wedding guests fast while the groom is still with them? As long as they have the groom with them
 they cannot fast. ","But the time will come when the groom will be taken away from them. Then they will fast.","\u201cNo one patches an old coat with a new piece of cloth that will shrink. Otherwise
 the new patch will shrink and rip away some of the old cloth
 and the tear will become worse. ","People don\u2019t pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do
 the wine will make the skins burst
 and both the wine and the skins will be ruined. Rather
 new wine is to be poured into fresh skins.\u201d","The Pharisees asked him
 \u201cLook! Why are your disciples doing something that is not permitted on the day of worship?\u201d","Yeshua asked them
 \u201cHaven\u2019t you ever read what David did when he and his men were in need and were hungry? ","Then he added
 \u201cThe day of worship was made for people
 not people for the day of worship. ","For this reason the Son of Man has authority over the day of worship.\u201d","So he told the man with the paralyzed hand
 \u201cStand in the center of the synagogue.\u201d ","Then he asked them
 \u201cIs it right to do good or to do evil on the day of worship
 to give a person back his health or to let him die?\u201d But they were silent. ","Yeshua was angry as he looked around at them. He was deeply hurt because their minds were closed. Then he told the man
 \u201cHold out your hand.\u201d The man held it out
 and his hand became normal again.","Yeshua called them together and used this illustration: \u201cHow can Satan force out Satan?","If a kingdom is divided against itself
 that kingdom cannot last. ","And if a household is divided against itself
 that household will not last. ","So if Satan rebels against himself and is divided
 he cannot last. That will be the end of him.","\u201cNo one can go into a strong man\u2019s house and steal his property. First he must tie up the strong man. Then he can go through the strong man\u2019s house and steal his property.","\u201cI can guarantee this truth: People will be forgiven for any sin or curse.","But whoever curses the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven. He is guilty of an everlasting sin.\u201d","The crowd sitting around Yeshua told him
 \u201cYour mother and your brothers are outside looking for you.\u201d","He replied to them
 \u201cWho is my mother
 and who are my brothers?\u201d ","Then looking at those who sat in a circle around him
 he said
 \u201cLook
 here are my mother and my brothers. ","Whoever does what God wants is my brother and sister and mother.\u201d","He used stories as illustrations to teach them many things. While he was teaching them
 he said
 ","\u201cListen! A farmer went to plant seed.","Some seeds were planted along the road
 and birds came and devoured them. ","Other seeds were planted on rocky ground
 where there wasn\u2019t much soil. The plants sprouted quickly because the soil wasn\u2019t deep. ","When the sun came up
 they were scorched. They didn\u2019t have any roots
 so they withered. ","Other seeds were planted among thornbushes. The thornbushes grew up and choked them
 and they didn\u2019t produce anything. ","But other seeds were planted on good ground
 sprouted
 and produced thirty
 sixty
 or one hundred times as much as was planted.\u201d ","He added
 \u201cLet the person who has ears listen!\u201d","Yeshua replied to them
 \u201cThe mystery about the kingdom of God has been given directly to you. To those on the outside
 it is given in stories:","\u2018They see clearly but don\u2019t perceive. They hear clearly but don\u2019t understand. They never return to me and are never forgiven.\u2019\u201d","Yeshua asked them
 \u201cDon\u2019t you understand this story? How
 then
 will you understand any of the stories I use as illustrations?","\u201cThe farmer plants the word.","Some people are like seeds that were planted along the road. Whenever they hear the word
 Satan comes at once and takes away the word that was planted in them. ","Other people are like seeds that were planted on rocky ground. Whenever they hear the word
 they accept it at once with joy. ","But they don\u2019t develop any roots. They last for a short time. When suffering or persecution comes along because of the word
 they immediately fall from faith. ","Other people are like seeds planted among thornbushes. They hear the word
 ","but the worries of life
 the deceitful pleasures of riches
 and the desires for other things take over. They choke the word so that it can\u2019t produce anything. ","Others are like seeds planted on good ground. They hear the word
 accept it
 and produce crops\u2014thirty
 sixty
 or one hundred times as much as was planted.\u201d","Yeshua said to them
 \u201cDoes anyone bring a lamp into a room to put it under a basket or under a bed? Isn\u2019t it put on a lamp stand? ","There is nothing hidden that will not be revealed. There is nothing kept secret that will not come to light.","Let the person who has ears listen!\u201d","He went on to say
 \u201cPay attention to what you\u2019re listening to! Knowledge will be measured out to you by the measure of attention you give. This is the way knowledge increases. ","Those who understand these mysteries will be given more knowledge. However
 some people don\u2019t understand these mysteries. Even what they understand will be taken away from them.\u201d","Yeshua said
 \u201cThe kingdom of God is like a man who scatters seeds on the ground. ","He sleeps at night and is awake during the day. The seeds sprout and grow
 although the man doesn\u2019t know how. ","The ground produces grain by itself. First the green blade appears
 then the head
 then the head full of grain. ","As soon as the grain is ready
 he cuts it with a sickle
 because harvest time has come.\u201d","Yeshua asked
 \u201cHow can we show what the kingdom of God is like? To what can we compare it? ","It\u2019s like a mustard seed planted in the ground. The mustard seed is one of the smallest seeds on earth.","However
 when planted
 it comes up and becomes taller than all the garden plants. It grows such large branches that birds can nest in its shade.\u201d","That evening
 Yeshua said to his disciples
 \u201cLet\u2019s cross to the other side.\u201d","Then he got up
 ordered the wind to stop
 and said to the sea
 \u201cBe still
 absolutely still!\u201d The wind stopped blowing
 and the sea became very calm.","He asked them
 \u201cWhy are you such cowards? Don\u2019t you have any faith yet?\u201d","He shouted this because Yeshua said
 \u201cYou evil spirit
 come out of the man.\u201d","Yeshua asked him
 \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d He told Yeshua
 \u201cMy name is Legion [Six Thousand]
 because there are many of us.\u201d ","But Yeshua would not allow it. Instead
 he told the man
 \u201cGo home to your family
 and tell them how much the Lord has done for you and how merciful he has been to you.\u201d","She said
 \u201cIf I can just touch his clothes
 I\u2019ll get well.\u201d ","His disciples said to him
 \u201cHow can you ask
 \u2018Who touched me
\u2019 when you see the crowd pressing you on all sides?\u201d","Yeshua told her
 \u201cDaughter
 your faith has made you well. Go in peace! Be cured from your illness.\u201d","When Yeshua overheard what they said
 he told the synagogue leader
 \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid! Just believe.\u201d","When he came into the house
 he asked them
 \u201cWhy are you making so much noise and crying? The child isn\u2019t dead. She\u2019s just sleeping.\u201d","Yeshua took the child\u2019s hand and said to her
 \u201cTalitha
 koum!\u201d which means
 \u201cLittle girl
 I\u2019m telling you to get up!\u201d","But Yeshua told them
 \u201cThe only place a prophet isn\u2019t honored is in his hometown
 among his relatives
 and in his own house.\u201d ","He called the twelve apostles
 sent them out two by two
 and gave them authority over evil spirits. ","He told them
 \u201cWhenever you go into a home
 stay there until you\u2019re ready to leave that place. ","Wherever people don\u2019t welcome you or listen to you
 leave and shake the dust from your feet as a warning to them.\u201d","But when Herod heard about it
 he said
 \u201cI had John\u2019s head cut off
 and he has come back to life!\u201d","His daughter
 that is
 Herodias\u2019 daughter
 came in and danced. Herod and his guests were delighted with her. The king told the girl
 \u201cAsk me for anything you want
 and I\u2019ll give it to you.\u201d ","So she went out and asked her mother
 \u201cWhat should I ask for?\u201d Her mother said
 \u201cAsk for the head of John the Baptizer.\u201d","So he said to them
 \u201cLet\u2019s go to a place where we can be alone to rest for a while.\u201d Many people were coming and going
 and Yeshua and the apostles didn\u2019t even have a chance to eat.","Yeshua replied
 \u201cYou give them something to eat.\u201d They said to him
 \u201cShould we go and spend about a year\u2019s wages on bread to feed them?\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cHow many loaves do you have? Go and see.\u201d When they found out
 they told him
 \u201cFive loaves of bread and two fish.\u201d","All of them saw him and were terrified. Immediately
 he said
 \u201cCalm down! It\u2019s me. Don\u2019t be afraid!\u201d ","Yeshua told them
 \u201cIsaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites in Scripture: \u2018These people honor me with their lips
 but their hearts are far from me.","Their worship of me is pointless
 because their teachings are rules made by humans.\u2019","\u201cYou abandon the commandments of God to follow human traditions.\u201d","He added
 \u201cYou have no trouble rejecting the commandments of God in order to keep your own traditions! ","For example
 Moses said
 \u2018Honor your father and your mother\u2019 and \u2018Whoever curses father or mother must be put to death.\u2019 ","But you say
 \u2018If a person tells his father or mother that whatever he might have used to help them is corban (that is
 an offering to God)
 ","he no longer has to do anything for his father or mother.\u2019","Because of your traditions you have destroyed the authority of God\u2019s word. And you do many other things like that.\u201d","Then he called the crowd again and said to them
 \u201cListen to me
 all of you
 and try to understand! ","Nothing that goes into a person from the outside can make him unclean. It\u2019s what comes out of a person that makes him unclean.","Yeshua said to them
 \u201cDon\u2019t you understand? Don\u2019t you know that whatever goes into a person from the outside can\u2019t make him unclean? ","It doesn\u2019t go into his thoughts but into his stomach and then into a toilet.\u201d (By saying this
 Yeshua declared all foods acceptable.) ","He continued
 \u201cIt\u2019s what comes out of a person that makes him unclean. ","Evil thoughts
 sexual sins
 stealing
 murder
 ","adultery
 greed
 wickedness
 cheating
 shameless lust
 envy
 cursing
 arrogance
 and foolishness come from within a person. ","All these evils come from within and make a person unclean.\u201d","Yeshua said to her
 \u201cFirst
 let the children eat all they want. It\u2019s not right to take the children\u2019s food and throw it to the dogs.\u201d","Yeshua said to her
 \u201cBecause you have said this
 go! The demon has left your daughter.\u201d","Then he looked up to heaven
 sighed
 and said to the man
 \u201cEphphatha!\u201d which means
 \u201cBe opened!\u201d ","About that time there was once again a large crowd with nothing to eat. Yeshua called his disciples and said to them
 ","\u201cI feel sorry for the people. They have been with me three days now and have nothing to eat.","If I send them home before they\u2019ve eaten
 they will become exhausted on the road. Some of them have come a long distance.\u201d","Yeshua asked them
 \u201cHow many loaves of bread do you have?\u201d They answered
 \u201cSeven.\u201d","With a deep sigh he asked
 \u201cWhy do these people demand a sign? I can guarantee this truth: If these people are given a sign
 it will be far different than what they want!\u201d","Yeshua warned them
 \u201cBe careful! Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod!\u201d","Yeshua knew what they were saying and asked them
 \u201cWhy are you discussing the fact that you don\u2019t have any bread? Don\u2019t you understand yet? Don\u2019t you catch on? Are your minds closed? ","Are you blind and deaf? Don\u2019t you remember?","When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand

 \u201cSeven.\u201d","He asked them
 \u201cDon\u2019t you catch on yet?\u201d","Yeshua took the blind man\u2019s hand and led him out of the village. He spit into the man\u2019s eyes and placed his hands on him. Yeshua asked him
 \u201cCan you see anything?\u201d","Yeshua told him when he sent him home
 \u201cDon\u2019t go into the village.\u201d","Then Yeshua and his disciples went to the villages around Caesarea Philippi. On the way he asked his disciples
 \u201cWho do people say I am?\u201d","He asked them
 \u201cBut who do you say I am?\u201d Peter answered him
 \u201cYou are the Messiah!\u201d","Yeshua turned
 looked at his disciples
 and objected to what Peter said. Yeshua said
 \u201cGet out of my way
 Satan! You aren\u2019t thinking the way God thinks but the way humans think.\u201d","Then Yeshua called the crowd to himself along with his disciples. He said to them
 \u201cThose who want to follow me must say no to the things they want

 and follow me. ","Those who want to save their lives will lose them. But those who lose their lives for me and for the Good News will save them.","What good does it do for people to win the whole world yet lose their lives?","Or what should a person give in exchange for life?","If people are ashamed of me and what I say in this unfaithful and sinful generation
 the Son of Man will be ashamed of those people when he comes with the holy angels in his Father\u2019s glory.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cI can guarantee this truth: Some people who are standing here will not die until they see the kingdom of God arrive with power.\u201d","Peter said to Yeshua
 \u201cRabbi
 it\u2019s good that we\u2019re here. Let\u2019s put up three tents\u2014one for you
 one for Moses

 \u201cElijah is coming first and will put everything in order again. But in what sense was it written that the Son of Man must suffer a lot and be treated shamefully? ","Indeed
 I can guarantee that Elijah has come. Yet
 people treated him as they pleased
 as Scripture says about him.\u201d","Yeshua asked the experts in Moses\u2019 Teachings
 \u201cWhat are you arguing about with them?\u201d","Yeshua said to them
 \u201cYou unbelieving generation! How long must I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring him to me!\u201d","Yeshua asked his father
 \u201cHow long has he been like this?\u201d The father replied
 \u201cHe has been this way since he was a child. ","Yeshua said to him
 \u201cAs far as possibilities go
 everything is possible for the person who believes.\u201d","When Yeshua saw that a crowd was running to the scene
 he gave an order to the evil spirit. He said
 \u201cYou spirit that won\u2019t let him talk
 I command you to come out of him and never enter him again.\u201d","He told them
 \u201cThis kind of spirit can be forced out only by prayer.\u201d","because he was teaching his disciples. He taught them
 \u201cThe Son of Man will be betrayed and handed over to people. They will kill him
 but on the third day he will come back to life.\u201d","Then they came to Capernaum. While Yeshua was at home
 he asked the disciples
 \u201cWhat were you arguing about on the road?\u201d ","He sat down and called the twelve apostles. He told them
 \u201cWhoever wants to be the most important person must take the last place and be a servant to everyone else.\u201d ","Then he took a little child and had him stand among them. He put his arms around the child and said to them
 ","Yeshua said
 \u201cDon\u2019t stop him! No one who works a miracle in my name can turn around and speak evil of me.

 tear it out! It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell. ","In hell worms that eat the body never die
 and the fire is never put out. ","Everyone will be salted with fire.","Salt is good. But if salt loses its taste
 how will you restore its flavor? Have salt within you

 \u201cWhat command did Moses give you?\u201d","Yeshua said to them
 \u201cHe wrote this command for you because you\u2019re heartless. ","But God made them male and female in the beginning
 at creation. ","That\u2019s why a man will leave his father and mother and will remain united with his wife
 ","and the two will be one. So they are no longer two but one.","Therefore
 don\u2019t let anyone separate what God has joined together.\u201d","He answered them
 \u201cWhoever divorces his wife and marries another woman is committing adultery. ","If a wife divorces her husband and marries another man
 she is committing adultery.\u201d","When Yeshua saw this
 he became irritated. He told them
 \u201cDon\u2019t stop the children from coming to me. Children like these are part of the kingdom of God. ","I can guarantee this truth: Whoever doesn\u2019t receive the kingdom of God as a little child receives it will never enter it.\u201d","Yeshua said to him
 \u201cWhy do you call me good? No one is good except God alone. ","You know the commandments: Never murder. Never commit adultery. Never steal. Never give false testimony. Never cheat. Honor your father and mother.\u201d","The man replied
 \u201cTeacher

 \u201cHow hard it will be for rich people to enter the kingdom of God!\u201d","The disciples were stunned by his words. But Yeshua said to them again
 \u201cChildren

 \u201cI can guarantee this truth: Anyone who gave up his home

 \u201cWhose face and name is this?\u201d They told him
 \u201cThe emperor\u2019s.\u201d","Yeshua said to them
 \u201cGive the emperor what belongs to the emperor
 and give God what belongs to God.\u201d They were surprised at his reply.","Yeshua said to them
 \u201cAren\u2019t you mistaken because you don\u2019t know the Scriptures or God\u2019s power? ","When the dead come back to life
 they don\u2019t marry. Rather
 they are like the angels in heaven. ","Haven\u2019t you read in the book of Moses that the dead come back to life? It\u2019s in the passage about the bush
 where God said
 \u2018I am the God of Abraham
 Isaac
 and Jacob.\u2019 ","He\u2019s not the God of the dead but of the living. You\u2019re badly mistaken!\u201d","One of the experts in Moses\u2019 Teachings went to Yeshua during the argument with the Sadducees. He saw how well Yeshua answered them
 so he asked him
 \u201cWhich commandment is the most important of them all?\u201d","Yeshua answered
 \u201cThe most important is
 \u2018Listen
 Israel
 the Lord our God is the only Lord. ","So love the Lord your God with all your heart
 with all your soul
 with all your mind
 and with all your strength.\u2019 ","The second most important commandment is this: \u2018Love your neighbor as you love yourself.\u2019 No other commandment is greater than these.\u201d","When Yeshua heard how wisely the man answered
 he told the man
 \u201cYou\u2019re not too far from the kingdom of God.\u201d After that
 no one dared to ask him another question.","While Yeshua was teaching in the temple courtyard
 he asked
 \u201cHow can the experts in Moses\u2019 Teachings say that the Messiah is David\u2019s son? ","David
 guided by the Holy Spirit
 said
 \u2018The Lord said to my Lord: \u201cTake the highest position in heaven until I put your enemies under your control.\u201d \u2019","David calls him Lord. So how can he be his son?\u201d The large crowd enjoyed listening to him.","As he taught
 he said
 \u201cWatch out for the experts in Moses\u2019 Teachings! They like to walk around in long robes
 to be greeted in the marketplaces
 ","and to have the front seats in synagogues and the places of honor at dinners.","They rob widows by taking their houses and then say long prayers to make themselves look good. The experts in Moses\u2019 Teachings will receive the most severe punishment.\u201d","He called his disciples and said to them
 \u201cI can guarantee this truth: This poor widow has given more than all the others. ","All of them have given what they could spare. But she
 in her poverty
 has given everything she had to live on.\u201d","As Yeshua was going out of the temple courtyard
 one of his disciples said to him
 \u201cTeacher
 look at these huge stones and these beautiful buildings!\u201d","Yeshua said to him
 \u201cDo you see these large buildings? Not one of these stones will be left on top of another. Each one will be torn down.\u201d","Yeshua answered them
 \u201cBe careful not to let anyone deceive you. ","Many will come using my name. They will say
 \u2018I am he
\u2019 and they will deceive many people.","\u201cWhen you hear of wars and rumors of wars
 don\u2019t be alarmed! These things must happen
 but they don\u2019t mean that the end has come. ","Nation will fight against nation and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes and famines in various places. These are only the beginning pains of the end.","\u201cBe on your guard! People will hand you over to the Jewish courts and whip you in their synagogues. You will stand in front of governors and kings to testify to them because of me.","But first
 the Good News must be spread to all nations. ","When they take you away to hand you over to the authorities
 don\u2019t worry ahead of time about what you will say. Instead
 say whatever is given to you to say when the time comes. Indeed
 you are not the one who will be speaking
 but the Holy Spirit will.","\u201cBrother will hand over brother to death; a father will hand over his child. Children will rebel against their parents and kill them.","Everyone will hate you because you are committed to me. But the person who endures to the end will be saved.","\u201cWhen you see the disgusting thing that will cause destruction standing where it should not (let the reader take note)
 those of you in Judea should flee to the mountains. ","Those who are on the roof should not come down to get anything out of their houses.","Those who are in the field should not turn back to get their coats.","\u201cHow horrible it will be for the women who are pregnant or who are nursing babies in those days.","Pray that it will not be in winter.","It will be a time of misery that has not happened from the beginning of God\u2019s creation until now
 and will certainly never happen again. ","If the Lord does not reduce that time
 no one will be saved. But those days will be reduced because of those whom God has chosen.","\u201cAt that time don\u2019t believe anyone who tells you
 \u2018Here is the Messiah!\u2019 or \u2018There he is!\u2019 ","False messiahs and false prophets will appear. They will work miraculous signs and do wonderful things to deceive
 if possible
 those whom God has chosen. ","Be on your guard! I have told you everything before it happens.","\u201cNow
 after the misery of those days
 the sun will turn dark
 the moon will not give light
 ","the stars will fall from the sky
 and the powers of the universe will be shaken.","\u201cThen people will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory.","He will send out his angels
 and from every direction under the sky
 they will gather those whom God has chosen.","\u201cLearn from the story of the fig tree. When its branch becomes tender and it sprouts leaves
 you know summer is near. ","In the same way
 when you see these things happen
 you know that he is near
 at the door.","\u201cI can guarantee this truth: This generation will not disappear until all these things take place.","The earth and the heavens will disappear
 but my words will never disappear.","\u201cNo one knows when that day or hour will come. Even the angels in heaven and the Son don\u2019t know. Only the Father knows.","Be careful! Watch! You don\u2019t know the exact time.","It is like a man who went on a trip. As he left home
 he put his servants in charge. He assigned work to each one and ordered the guard to be alert. ","Therefore
 be alert
 because you don\u2019t know when the owner of the house will return. It could be in the evening or at midnight or at dawn or in the morning. ","Make sure he doesn\u2019t come suddenly and find you asleep.","I\u2019m telling everyone what I\u2019m telling you: \u2018Be alert!\u2019\u201d","Some who were there were irritated and said to one another
 \u201cWhy was the perfume wasted like this? ","Yeshua said
 \u201cLeave her alone! Why are you bothering her? She has done a beautiful thing for me. ","You will always have the poor with you and can help them whenever you want. But you will not always have me with you.","She did what she could. She came to pour perfume on my body before it is placed in a tomb.","I can guarantee this truth: Wherever the Good News is spoken in the world
 what she has done will also be told in memory of her.\u201d","He sent two of his disciples and told them
 \u201cGo into the city. You will meet a man carrying a jug of water. Follow him. ","When he goes into a house
 tell the owner that the teacher asks
 \u2018Where is my room where I can eat the Passover meal with my disciples?\u2019 ","He will take you upstairs and show you a large room. The room will be completely furnished. Get everything ready for us there.\u201d","While they were at the table eating
 Yeshua said
 \u201cI can guarantee this truth: One of you is going to betray me
 one who is eating with me!\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cIt\u2019s one of you twelve
 someone dipping his hand into the bowl with me. ","The Son of Man is going to die as the Scriptures say he will. But how horrible it will be for that person who betrays the Son of Man! It would have been better for that person if he had never been born.\u201d","While they were eating
 Yeshua took bread and blessed it. He broke the bread
 gave it to them
 and said
 \u201cTake this. This is my body.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cThis is my blood
 the blood of the promise. It is poured out for many people.","\u201cI can guarantee this truth: I won\u2019t drink this wine again until that day when I drink new wine in the kingdom of God.\u201d","Then Yeshua said to them
 \u201cAll of you will abandon me. Scripture says
 \u2018I will strike the shepherd
 and the sheep will be scattered.\u2019","\u201cBut after I am brought back to life
 I will go to Galilee ahead of you.\u201d","Yeshua said to Peter
 \u201cI can guarantee this truth: Tonight
 before a rooster crows twice
 you will say three times that you don\u2019t know me.\u201d","Then they came to a place called Gethsemane. He said to his disciples
 \u201cStay here while I pray.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cMy anguish is so great that I feel as if I\u2019m dying. Wait here
 and stay awake.\u201d","He said
 \u201cAbba! Father! You can do anything. Take this cup of suffering away from me. But let your will be done rather than mine.\u201d","He went back and found them asleep. He said to Peter
 \u201cSimon
 are you sleeping? Couldn\u2019t you stay awake for one hour? ","Stay awake
 and pray that you won\u2019t be tempted. You want to do what\u2019s right
 but you\u2019re weak.\u201d","He came back a third time and said to them
 \u201cYou might as well sleep now. It\u2019s all over. The time has come for the Son of Man to be handed over to sinners. ","Get up! Let\u2019s go! The one who is betraying me is near.\u201d","Yeshua asked them
 \u201cHave you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me as if I were a criminal? ","I used to teach in the temple courtyard every day. But you didn\u2019t arrest me then. But what the Scriptures say must come true.\u201d","Yeshua answered
 \u201cYes
 I am
 and you will see the Son of Man in the highest position in heaven. He will be coming with the clouds of heaven.\u201d","Some of them began to spit on him. They covered his face and hit him with their fists. They said to him
 \u201cProphesy!\u201d Even the guards took him and slapped him.","Just then a rooster crowed a second time. Peter remembered that Yeshua said to him
 \u201cBefore a rooster crows twice
 you will say three times that you don\u2019t know me.\u201d Then Peter began to cry very hard.","Pilate asked him
 \u201cAre you the king of the Jews?\u201d \u201cYes
 I am
\u201d Yeshua answered him.","Pilate answered them
 \u201cDo you want me to free the king of the Jews for you?\u201d ","At three o\u2019clock Yeshua cried out in a loud voice
 \u201cEloi
 Eloi

 \u201cMy God

 he said
 \u201cCertainly
 this man was the Son of God!\u201d","Pilate wondered if Yeshua had already died. So he summoned the officer to ask him if Yeshua was

 dead. ","They said to one another

 who was crucified. He has been brought back to life. He\u2019s not here. Look at the place where they laid him. ","Then Yeshua said to them
 \u201cSo wherever you go in the world
 tell everyone the Good News. ","Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved
 but whoever does not believe will be condemned.","\u201cThese are the miraculous signs that will accompany believers: They will use the power and authority of my name to force demons out of people. They will speak new languages.","They will pick up snakes

 \u2018The time is fulfilled

 \u2018Be silent
 and come out of him!\u2019 ","When they found him
 they said to him
 \u2018Everyone is searching for you.\u2019 ","He answered
 \u2018Let us go on to the neighbouring towns
 so that I may proclaim the message there also; for that is what I came out to do.\u2019 ","Moved with pity
 Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him
 and said to him
 \u2018I do choose. Be made clean!\u2019 ","saying to him
 \u2018See that you say nothing to anyone; but go
 show yourself to the priest
 and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded
 as a testimony to them.\u2019 ","When Jesus saw their faith
 he said to the paralytic
 \u2018Son
 your sins are forgiven.\u2019 ","At once Jesus perceived in his spirit that they were discussing these questions among themselves; and he said to them
 \u2018Why do you raise such questions in your hearts? ","Which is easier
 to say to the paralytic
 \u201cYour sins are forgiven\u201d
 or to say
 \u201cStand up and take your mat and walk\u201d? ","But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins\u2019\u2014he said to the paralytic\u2014","\u2018I say to you
 stand up

 he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax booth
 and he said to him
 \u2018Follow me.\u2019 And he got up and followed him.","When Jesus heard this
 he said to them
 \u2018Those who are well have no need of a physician

 \u2018The wedding-guests cannot fast while the bridegroom is with them
 can they? As long as they have the bridegroom with them
 they cannot fast. ","The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them
 and then they will fast on that day.","\u2018No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old cloak; otherwise
 the patch pulls away from it
 the new from the old
 and a worse tear is made. ","And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; otherwise
 the wine will burst the skins
 and the wine is lost
 and so are the skins; but one puts new wine into fresh wineskins.\u2019","The Pharisees said to him
 \u2018Look
 why are they doing what is not lawful on the sabbath?\u2019 ","And he said to them
 \u2018Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need of food? ","Then he said to them
 \u2018The sabbath was made for humankind
 and not humankind for the sabbath; ","so the Son of Man is lord even of the sabbath.\u2019","And he said to the man who had the withered hand
 \u2018Come forward.\u2019 ","Then he said to them
 \u2018Is it lawful to do good or to do harm on the sabbath
 to save life or to kill?\u2019 But they were silent. ","He looked around at them with anger; he was grieved at their hardness of heart and said to the man
 \u2018Stretch out your hand.\u2019 He stretched it out
 and his hand was restored. ","And he called them to him

 \u2018How can Satan cast out Satan? ","If a kingdom is divided against itself

 people will be forgiven for their sins and whatever blasphemies they utter; ","but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit can never have forgiveness
 but is guilty of an eternal sin\u2019\u2014 ","A crowd was sitting around him; and they said to him
 \u2018Your mother and your brothers and sisters are outside
 asking for you.\u2019 ","And he replied
 \u2018Who are my mother and my brothers?\u2019 ","And looking at those who sat around him
 he said
 \u2018Here are my mother and my brothers! ","Whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother.\u2019","He began to teach them many things in parables
 and in his teaching he said to them: ","\u2018Listen! A sower went out to sow.","And as he sowed
 some seed fell on the path
 and the birds came and ate it up. ","Other seed fell on rocky ground
 where it did not have much soil
 and it sprang up quickly
 since it had no depth of soil. ","And when the sun rose
 it was scorched; and since it had no root
 it withered away. ","Other seed fell among thorns
 and the thorns grew up and choked it
 and it yielded no grain. ","Other seed fell into good soil and brought forth grain
 growing up and increasing and yielding thirty and sixty and a hundredfold.\u2019 ","And he said
 \u2018Let anyone with ears to hear listen!\u2019","And he said to them
 \u2018To you has been given the secret of the kingdom of God
 but for those outside
 everything comes in parables; ","in order that \u201cthey may indeed look
 but not perceive
 and may indeed listen
 but not understand; so that they may not turn again and be forgiven.\u201d\u2019","And he said to them
 \u2018Do you not understand this parable? Then how will you understand all the parables? ","The sower sows the word.","These are the ones on the path where the word is sown: when they hear
 Satan immediately comes and takes away the word that is sown in them. ","And these are the ones sown on rocky ground: when they hear the word
 they immediately receive it with joy. ","But they have no root
 and endure only for a while; then
 when trouble or persecution arises on account of the word
 immediately they fall away. ","And others are those sown among the thorns: these are the ones who hear the word
 ","but the cares of the world
 and the lure of wealth
 and the desire for other things come in and choke the word
 and it yields nothing. ","And these are the ones sown on the good soil: they hear the word and accept it and bear fruit
 thirty and sixty and a hundredfold.\u2019","He said to them
 \u2018Is a lamp brought in to be put under the bushel basket
 or under the bed
 and not on the lampstand? ","For there is nothing hidden
 except to be disclosed; nor is anything secret
 except to come to light. ","Let anyone with ears to hear listen!\u2019","And he said to them
 \u2018Pay attention to what you hear; the measure you give will be the measure you get
 and still more will be given you. ","For to those who have
 more will be given; and from those who have nothing
 even what they have will be taken away.\u2019","He also said
 \u2018The kingdom of God is as if someone would scatter seed on the ground
 ","and would sleep and rise night and day
 and the seed would sprout and grow
 he does not know how. ","The earth produces of itself
 first the stalk
 then the head
 then the full grain in the head. ","But when the grain is ripe
 at once he goes in with his sickle
 because the harvest has come.\u2019","He also said
 \u2018With what can we compare the kingdom of God
 or what parable will we use for it? ","It is like a mustard seed
 which
 when sown upon the ground
 is the smallest of all the seeds on earth; ","yet when it is sown it grows up and becomes the greatest of all shrubs
 and puts forth large branches
 so that the birds of the air can make nests in its shade.\u2019","On that day
 when evening had come
 he said to them
 \u2018Let us go across to the other side.\u2019 ","He woke up and rebuked the wind
 and said to the sea
 \u2018Peace! Be still!\u2019 Then the wind ceased
 and there was a dead calm. ","He said to them
 \u2018Why are you afraid? Have you still no faith?\u2019 ","For he had said to him
 \u2018Come out of the man
 you unclean spirit!\u2019 ","Then Jesus asked him
 \u2018What is your name?\u2019 He replied
 \u2018My name is Legion; for we are many.\u2019 ","But Jesus refused
 and said to him
 \u2018Go home to your friends
 and tell them how much the Lord has done for you
 and what mercy he has shown you.\u2019 ","for she said
 \u2018If I but touch his clothes
 I will be made well.\u2019 ","And his disciples said to him
 \u2018You see the crowd pressing in on you; how can you say
 \u201cWho touched me?\u201d\u2019 ","He said to her
 \u2018Daughter
 your faith has made you well; go in peace
 and be healed of your disease.\u2019","But overhearing what they said
 Jesus said to the leader of the synagogue
 \u2018Do not fear
 only believe.\u2019 ","When he had entered
 he said to them
 \u2018Why do you make a commotion and weep? The child is not dead but sleeping.\u2019 ","He took her by the hand and said to her
 \u2018Talitha cum\u2019
 which means
 \u2018Little girl
 get up!\u2019 ","Then Jesus said to them
 \u2018Prophets are not without honour
 except in their home town
 and among their own kin
 and in their own house.\u2019 ","He called the twelve and began to send them out two by two
 and gave them authority over the unclean spirits. ","He said to them
 \u2018Wherever you enter a house
 stay there until you leave the place. ","If any place will not welcome you and they refuse to hear you
 as you leave
 shake off the dust that is on your feet as a testimony against them.\u2019 ","But when Herod heard of it
 he said
 \u2018John
 whom I beheaded
 has been raised.\u2019","When his daughter Herodias came in and danced
 she pleased Herod and his guests; and the king said to the girl
 \u2018Ask me for whatever you wish
 and I will give it.\u2019 ","She went out and said to her mother
 \u2018What should I ask for?\u2019 She replied
 \u2018The head of John the baptizer.\u2019 ","He said to them
 \u2018Come away to a deserted place all by yourselves and rest a while.\u2019 For many were coming and going
 and they had no leisure even to eat. ","But he answered them
 \u2018You give them something to eat.\u2019 They said to him
 \u2018Are we to go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread
 and give it to them to eat?\u2019 ","And he said to them
 \u2018How many loaves have you? Go and see.\u2019 When they had found out
 they said
 \u2018Five
 and two fish.\u2019 ","for they all saw him and were terrified. But immediately he spoke to them and said
 \u2018Take heart
 it is I; do not be afraid.\u2019 ","He said to them
 \u2018Isaiah prophesied rightly about you hypocrites
 as it is written
 \u201cThis people honours me with their lips
 but their hearts are far from me;","in vain do they worship me
 teaching human precepts as doctrines.\u201d","You abandon the commandment of God and hold to human tradition.\u2019","Then he said to them
 \u2018You have a fine way of rejecting the commandment of God in order to keep your tradition! ","For Moses said
 \u201cHonour your father and your mother\u201d; and
 \u201cWhoever speaks evil of father or mother must surely die.\u201d ","But you say that if anyone tells father or mother
 \u201cWhatever support you might have had from me is Corban\u201d (that is
 an offering to God)\u2014 ","then you no longer permit doing anything for a father or mother
 ","thus making void the word of God through your tradition that you have handed on. And you do many things like this.\u2019","Then he called the crowd again and said to them
 \u2018Listen to me
 all of you
 and understand: ","there is nothing outside a person that by going in can defile
 but the things that come out are what defile.\u2019","He said to them
 \u2018Then do you also fail to understand? Do you not see that whatever goes into a person from outside cannot defile
 ","since it enters
 not the heart but the stomach
 and goes out into the sewer?\u2019 (Thus he declared all foods clean.) ","And he said
 \u2018It is what comes out of a person that defiles. ","For it is from within
 from the human heart
 that evil intentions come: fornication
 theft
 murder
 ","adultery
 avarice
 wickedness
 deceit
 licentiousness
 envy
 slander
 pride
 folly. ","All these evil things come from within
 and they defile a person.\u2019","He said to her
 \u2018Let the children be fed first
 for it is not fair to take the children\u2019s food and throw it to the dogs.\u2019 ","Then he said to her
 \u2018For saying that
 you may go\u2014the demon has left your daughter.\u2019 ","Then looking up to heaven
 he sighed and said to him
 \u2018Ephphatha\u2019

 \u2018Be opened.\u2019 ","In those days when there was again a great crowd without anything to eat
 he called his disciples and said to them
 ","\u2018I have compassion for the crowd
 because they have been with me now for three days and have nothing to eat. ","If I send them away hungry to their homes
 they will faint on the way\u2014and some of them have come from a great distance.\u2019 ","He asked them
 \u2018How many loaves do you have?\u2019 They said
 \u2018Seven.\u2019 ","And he sighed deeply in his spirit and said
 \u2018Why does this generation ask for a sign? Truly I tell you
 no sign will be given to this generation.\u2019 ","And he cautioned them
 saying
 \u2018Watch out\u2014beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod.\u2019 ","And becoming aware of it
 Jesus said to them
 \u2018Why are you talking about having no bread? Do you still not perceive or understand? Are your hearts hardened? ","Do you have eyes
 and fail to see? Do you have ears
 and fail to hear? And do you not remember? ","When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand
 how many baskets full of broken pieces did you collect?\u2019 They said to him
 \u2018Twelve.\u2019 ","\u2018And the seven for the four thousand

 \u2018Seven.\u2019 ","Then he said to them
 \u2018Do you not yet understand?\u2019","He took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village; and when he had put saliva on his eyes and laid his hands on him

 \u2018Do not even go into the village.\u2019","Jesus went on with his disciples to the villages of Caesarea Philippi; and on the way he asked his disciples

 \u2018You are the Messiah.\u2019 ","But turning and looking at his disciples
 he rebuked Peter and said
 \u2018Get behind me

 \u2018If any want to become my followers
 let them deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me. ","For those who want to save their life will lose it
 and those who lose their life for my sake
 and for the sake of the gospel
 will save it. ","For what will it profit them to gain the whole world and forfeit their life?","Indeed
 what can they give in return for their life? ","Those who are ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation
 of them the Son of Man will also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.\u2019 ","And he said to them
 \u2018Truly I tell you
 there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see that the kingdom of God has come with power.\u2019","Then Peter said to Jesus
 \u2018Rabbi
 it is good for us to be here; let us make three dwellings
 one for you
 one for Moses
 and one for Elijah.\u2019 ","He said to them
 \u2018Elijah is indeed coming first to restore all things. How then is it written about the Son of Man
 that he is to go through many sufferings and be treated with contempt? ","But I tell you that Elijah has come
 and they did to him whatever they pleased
 as it is written about him.\u2019","He asked them
 \u2018What are you arguing about with them?\u2019 ","He answered them
 \u2018You faithless generation
 how much longer must I be among you? How much longer must I put up with you? Bring him to me.\u2019 ","Jesus asked the father
 \u2018How long has this been happening to him?\u2019 And he said
 \u2018From childhood. ","Jesus said to him
 \u2018If you are able!\u2014All things can be done for the one who believes.\u2019 ","When Jesus saw that a crowd came running together
 he rebuked the unclean spirit
 saying to it
 \u2018You spirit that keep this boy from speaking and hearing
 I command you
 come out of him
 and never enter him again!\u2019 ","He said to them
 \u2018This kind can come out only through prayer.\u2019","for he was teaching his disciples
 saying to them
 \u2018The Son of Man is to be betrayed into human hands
 and they will kill him
 and three days after being killed
 he will rise again.\u2019 ","Then they came to Capernaum; and when he was in the house he asked them
 \u2018What were you arguing about on the way?\u2019 ","He sat down
 called the twelve
 and said to them
 \u2018Whoever wants to be first must be last of all and servant of all.\u2019 ","Then he took a little child and put it among them; and taking it in his arms
 he said to them
 ","But Jesus said
 \u2018Do not stop him; for no one who does a deed of power in my name will be able soon afterwards to speak evil of me. ","Whoever is not against us is for us.","For truly I tell you
 whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you bear the name of Christ will by no means lose the reward.","\u2018If any of you put a stumbling-block before one of these little ones who believe in me
 it would be better for you if a great millstone were hung around your neck and you were thrown into the sea. ","If your hand causes you to stumble
 cut it off; it is better for you to enter life maimed than to have two hands and to go to hell
 to the unquenchable fire. ","And if your foot causes you to stumble
 cut it off; it is better for you to enter life lame than to have two feet and to be thrown into hell. ","And if your eye causes you to stumble
 tear it out; it is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and to be thrown into hell
 ","where their worm never dies
 and the fire is never quenched.","\u2018For everyone will be salted with fire.","Salt is good; but if salt has lost its saltiness
 how can you season it? Have salt in yourselves
 and be at peace with one another.\u2019","He answered them
 \u2018What did Moses command you?\u2019 ","But Jesus said to them
 \u2018Because of your hardness of heart he wrote this commandment for you. ","But from the beginning of creation
 \u201cGod made them male and female.\u201d ","\u201cFor this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife
 ","and the two shall become one flesh.\u201d So they are no longer two
 but one flesh. ","Therefore what God has joined together
 let no one separate.\u2019","He said to them
 \u2018Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her; ","and if she divorces her husband and marries another
 she commits adultery.\u2019","But when Jesus saw this
 he was indignant and said to them
 \u2018Let the little children come to me; do not stop them; for it is to such as these that the kingdom of God belongs. ","Truly I tell you
 whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will never enter it.\u2019 ","Jesus said to him
 \u2018Why do you call me good? No one is good but God alone. ","You know the commandments: \u201cYou shall not murder; You shall not commit adultery; You shall not steal; You shall not bear false witness; You shall not defraud; Honour your father and mother.\u201d\u2019","He said to him
 \u2018Teacher
 I have kept all these since my youth.\u2019 ","Jesus
 looking at him
 loved him and said
 \u2018You lack one thing; go
 sell what you own
 and give the money to the poor
 and you will have treasure in heaven; then come
 follow me.\u2019 ","Then Jesus looked around and said to his disciples
 \u2018How hard it will be for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God!\u2019 ","And the disciples were perplexed at these words. But Jesus said to them again
 \u2018Children
 how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God! ","It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.\u2019","They were greatly astounded and said to one another
 \u2018Then who can be saved?\u2019 ","Jesus looked at them and said
 \u2018For mortals it is impossible
 but not for God; for God all things are possible.\u2019","Jesus said
 \u2018Truly I tell you
 there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields
 for my sake and for the sake of the good news
 ","who will not receive a hundredfold now in this age\u2014houses
 brothers and sisters
 mothers and children
 and fields
 with persecutions\u2014and in the age to come eternal life. ","But many who are first will be last
 and the last will be first.\u2019","saying
 \u2018See
 we are going up to Jerusalem
 and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the scribes
 and they will condemn him to death; then they will hand him over to the Gentiles; ","they will mock him
 and spit upon him
 and flog him
 and kill him; and after three days he will rise again.\u2019","James and John
 the sons of Zebedee
 came forward to him and said to him
 \u2018Teacher
 we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you.\u2019 ","And he said to them
 \u2018What is it you want me to do for you?\u2019 ","But Jesus said to them
 \u2018You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink
 or be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?\u2019 ","They replied
 \u2018We are able.\u2019 Then Jesus said to them
 \u2018The cup that I drink you will drink; and with the baptism with which I am baptized
 you will be baptized; ","but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant
 but it is for those for whom it has been prepared.\u2019","So Jesus called them and said to them
 \u2018You know that among the Gentiles those whom they recognize as their rulers lord it over them
 and their great ones are tyrants over them. ","But it is not so among you; but whoever wishes to become great among you must be your servant
 ","and whoever wishes to be first among you must be slave of all.","For the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve
 and to give his life a ransom for many.\u2019","Jesus stood still and said
 \u2018Call him here.\u2019 And they called the blind man
 saying to him
 \u2018Take heart; get up
 he is calling you.\u2019 ","Then Jesus said to him
 \u2018What do you want me to do for you?\u2019 The blind man said to him
 \u2018My teacher
 let me see again.\u2019 ","Jesus said to him
 \u2018Go; your faith has made you well.\u2019 Immediately he regained his sight and followed him on the way.","and said to them
 \u2018Go into the village ahead of you
 and immediately as you enter it
 you will find tied there a colt that has never been ridden; untie it and bring it. ","If anyone says to you
 \u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d just say this
 \u201cThe Lord needs it and will send it back here immediately.\u201d\u2019 ","He said to it
 \u2018May no one ever eat fruit from you again.\u2019 And his disciples heard it.","He was teaching and saying
 \u2018Is it not written
 \u201cMy house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations\u201d? But you have made it a den of robbers.\u2019","Jesus answered them
 \u2018Have faith in God. ","Truly I tell you
 if you say to this mountain
 \u201cBe taken up and thrown into the sea\u201d
 and if you do not doubt in your heart
 but believe that what you say will come to pass
 it will be done for you. ","So I tell you
 whatever you ask for in prayer
 believe that you have received it
 and it will be yours.","\u2018Whenever you stand praying
 forgive
 if you have anything against anyone; so that your Father in heaven may also forgive you your trespasses.\u2019","Jesus said to them
 \u2018I will ask you one question; answer me
 and I will tell you by what authority I do these things. ","Did the baptism of John come from heaven
 or was it of human origin? Answer me.\u2019 ","So they answered Jesus
 \u2018We do not know.\u2019 And Jesus said to them
 \u2018Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.\u2019","Then he began to speak to them in parables. \u2018A man planted a vineyard
 put a fence around it
 dug a pit for the wine press
 and built a watch-tower; then he leased it to tenants and went to another country. ","When the season came
 he sent a slave to the tenants to collect from them his share of the produce of the vineyard. ","But they seized him
 and beat him
 and sent him away empty-handed. ","And again he sent another slave to them; this one they beat over the head and insulted.","Then he sent another
 and that one they killed. And so it was with many others; some they beat
 and others they killed. ","He had still one other
 a beloved son. Finally he sent him to them
 saying
 \u201cThey will respect my son.\u201d ","But those tenants said to one another
 \u201cThis is the heir; come
 let us kill him
 and the inheritance will be ours.\u201d ","So they seized him
 killed him
 and threw him out of the vineyard. ","What then will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the tenants and give the vineyard to others.","Have you not read this scripture: \u201cThe stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone;","this was the Lord\u2019s doing
 and it is amazing in our eyes\u201d?\u2019","Then they sent to him some Pharisees and some Herodians to trap him in what he said.","Should we pay them
 or should we not?\u2019 But knowing their hypocrisy
 he said to them
 \u2018Why are you putting me to the test? Bring me a denarius and let me see it.\u2019 ","And they brought one. Then he said to them
 \u2018Whose head is this
 and whose title?\u2019 They answered
 \u2018The emperor\u2019s.\u2019 ","Jesus said to them
 \u2018Give to the emperor the things that are the emperor\u2019s
 and to God the things that are God\u2019s.\u2019 And they were utterly amazed at him.","Jesus said to them
 \u2018Is not this the reason you are wrong
 that you know neither the scriptures nor the power of God? ","For when they rise from the dead
 they neither marry nor are given in marriage
 but are like angels in heaven. ","And as for the dead being raised
 have you not read in the book of Moses
 in the story about the bush
 how God said to him
 \u201cI am the God of Abraham
 the God of Isaac
 and the God of Jacob\u201d? ","He is God not of the dead
 but of the living; you are quite wrong.\u2019","One of the scribes came near and heard them disputing with one another
 and seeing that he answered them well
 he asked him
 \u2018Which commandment is the first of all?\u2019 ","Jesus answered
 \u2018The first is
 \u201cHear
 O Israel: the Lord our God
 the Lord is one; ","you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart
 and with all your soul
 and with all your mind
 and with all your strength.\u201d ","The second is this
 \u201cYou shall love your neighbour as yourself.\u201d There is no other commandment greater than these.\u2019 ","When Jesus saw that he answered wisely
 he said to him
 \u2018You are not far from the kingdom of God.\u2019 After that no one dared to ask him any question.","While Jesus was teaching in the temple
 he said
 \u2018How can the scribes say that the Messiah is the son of David? ","David himself
 by the Holy Spirit
 declared
 \u201cThe Lord said to my Lord
 \u2018Sit at my right hand
 until I put your enemies under your feet.\u2019\u201d","David himself calls him Lord; so how can he be his son?\u2019 And the large crowd was listening to him with delight.","As he taught
 he said
 \u2018Beware of the scribes
 who like to walk around in long robes
 and to be greeted with respect in the market-places
 ","and to have the best seats in the synagogues and places of honour at banquets!","They devour widows\u2019 houses and for the sake of appearance say long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation.\u2019","Then he called his disciples and said to them
 \u2018Truly I tell you
 this poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the treasury. ","For all of them have contributed out of their abundance; but she out of her poverty has put in everything she had
 all she had to live on.\u2019","As he came out of the temple
 one of his disciples said to him
 \u2018Look
 Teacher
 what large stones and what large buildings!\u2019 ","Then Jesus asked him
 \u2018Do you see these great buildings? Not one stone will be left here upon another; all will be thrown down.\u2019","Then Jesus began to say to them
 \u2018Beware that no one leads you astray. ","Many will come in my name and say
 \u201cI am he!\u201d and they will lead many astray. ","When you hear of wars and rumours of wars
 do not be alarmed; this must take place
 but the end is still to come. ","For nation will rise against nation
 and kingdom against kingdom; there will be earthquakes in various places; there will be famines. This is but the beginning of the birth pangs.","\u2018As for yourselves
 beware; for they will hand you over to councils; and you will be beaten in synagogues; and you will stand before governors and kings because of me
 as a testimony to them. ","And the good news must first be proclaimed to all nations.","When they bring you to trial and hand you over
 do not worry beforehand about what you are to say; but say whatever is given you at that time
 for it is not you who speak
 but the Holy Spirit. ","Brother will betray brother to death
 and a father his child
 and children will rise against parents and have them put to death; ","and you will be hated by all because of my name. But the one who endures to the end will be saved.","\u2018But when you see the desolating sacrilege set up where it ought not to be (let the reader understand)
 then those in Judea must flee to the mountains; ","someone on the housetop must not go down or enter the house to take anything away;","someone in the field must not turn back to get a coat.","Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing infants in those days!","Pray that it may not be in winter.","For in those days there will be suffering
 such as has not been from the beginning of the creation that God created until now
 no
 and never will be. ","And if the Lord had not cut short those days
 no one would be saved; but for the sake of the elect
 whom he chose
 he has cut short those days. ","And if anyone says to you at that time
 \u201cLook! Here is the Messiah!\u201d or \u201cLook! There he is!\u201d\u2014do not believe it. ","False messiahs and false prophets will appear and produce signs and omens
 to lead astray
 if possible
 the elect. ","But be alert; I have already told you everything.","\u2018But in those days
 after that suffering
 the sun will be darkened
 and the moon will not give its light
","and the stars will be falling from heaven
 and the powers in the heavens will be shaken.","Then they will see \u201cthe Son of Man coming in clouds\u201d with great power and glory.","Then he will send out the angels
 and gather his elect from the four winds
 from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven.","\u2018From the fig tree learn its lesson: as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts forth its leaves
 you know that summer is near. ","So also
 when you see these things taking place
 you know that he is near
 at the very gates. ","Truly I tell you
 this generation will not pass away until all these things have taken place. ","Heaven and earth will pass away
 but my words will not pass away.","\u2018But about that day or hour no one knows
 neither the angels in heaven
 nor the Son
 but only the Father. ","Beware
 keep alert; for you do not know when the time will come. ","It is like a man going on a journey
 when he leaves home and puts his slaves in charge
 each with his work
 and commands the doorkeeper to be on the watch. ","Therefore
 keep awake\u2014for you do not know when the master of the house will come
 in the evening
 or at midnight
 or at cockcrow
 or at dawn
 ","or else he may find you asleep when he comes suddenly.","And what I say to you I say to all: Keep awake.\u2019","But some were there who said to one another in anger
 \u2018Why was the ointment wasted in this way? ","But Jesus said
 \u2018Let her alone; why do you trouble her? She has performed a good service for me. ","For you always have the poor with you
 and you can show kindness to them whenever you wish; but you will not always have me. ","She has done what she could; she has anointed my body beforehand for its burial.","Truly I tell you
 wherever the good news is proclaimed in the whole world
 what she has done will be told in remembrance of her.\u2019","So he sent two of his disciples
 saying to them
 \u2018Go into the city
 and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you; follow him
 ","and wherever he enters
 say to the owner of the house
 \u201cThe Teacher asks
 Where is my guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?\u201d ","He will show you a large room upstairs
 furnished and ready. Make preparations for us there.\u2019 ","And when they had taken their places and were eating
 Jesus said
 \u2018Truly I tell you
 one of you will betray me
 one who is eating with me.\u2019 ","He said to them
 \u2018It is one of the twelve
 one who is dipping bread into the bowl with me. ","For the Son of Man goes as it is written of him
 but woe to that one by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that one not to have been born.\u2019","While they were eating
 he took a loaf of bread
 and after blessing it he broke it
 gave it to them
 and said
 \u2018Take; this is my body.\u2019 ","He said to them
 \u2018This is my blood of the covenant
 which is poured out for many. ","Truly I tell you
 I will never again drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.\u2019","And Jesus said to them
 \u2018You will all become deserters; for it is written
 \u201cI will strike the shepherd
 and the sheep will be scattered.\u201d","But after I am raised up
 I will go before you to Galilee.\u2019 ","Jesus said to him
 \u2018Truly I tell you
 this day
 this very night
 before the cock crows twice
 you will deny me three times.\u2019 ","They went to a place called Gethsemane; and he said to his disciples
 \u2018Sit here while I pray.\u2019 ","And he said to them
 \u2018I am deeply grieved
 even to death; remain here
 and keep awake.\u2019 ","He said
 \u2018Abba
 Father
 for you all things are possible; remove this cup from me; yet
 not what I want
 but what you want.\u2019 ","He came and found them sleeping; and he said to Peter
 \u2018Simon
 are you asleep? Could you not keep awake one hour? ","Keep awake and pray that you may not come into the time of trial; the spirit indeed is willing
 but the flesh is weak.\u2019 ","He came a third time and said to them
 \u2018Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? Enough! The hour has come; the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. ","Get up
 let us be going. See
 my betrayer is at hand.\u2019","Then Jesus said to them
 \u2018Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me as though I were a bandit? ","Day after day I was with you in the temple teaching
 and you did not arrest me. But let the scriptures be fulfilled.\u2019 ","Jesus said
 \u2018I am; and \u201cyou will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Power\u201d
 and \u201ccoming with the clouds of heaven.\u201d\u2019","Some began to spit on him
 to blindfold him
 and to strike him
 saying to him
 \u2018Prophesy!\u2019 The guards also took him over and beat him.","At that moment the cock crowed for the second time. Then Peter remembered that Jesus had said to him
 \u2018Before the cock crows twice
 you will deny me three times.\u2019 And he broke down and wept.","Pilate asked him
 \u2018Are you the King of the Jews?\u2019 He answered him
 \u2018You say so.\u2019 ","Then he answered them
 \u2018Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?\u2019 ","At three o\u2019clock Jesus cried out with a loud voice
 \u2018Eloi
 Eloi
 lema sabachthani?\u2019 which means
 \u2018My God
 my God

 who stood facing him
 saw that in this way he breathed his last
 he said
 \u2018Truly this man was God\u2019s Son!\u2019","Then Pilate wondered if he were already dead; and summoning the centurion
 he asked him whether he had been dead for some time. ","They had been saying to one another
 \u2018Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb?\u2019 ","But he said to them
 \u2018Do not be alarmed; you are looking for Jesus of Nazareth

 there is the place they laid him. ","And he said to them
 \u2018Go into all the world and proclaim the good news to the whole creation. ","The one who believes and is baptized will be saved; but the one who does not believe will be condemned.","And these signs will accompany those who believe: by using my name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues;","they will pick up snakes in their hands

 it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick

 the Son of God.","and saying
 \u201cThe time is fulfilled

 \u201cBe silent
 and come out of him!\u201d ","When they found him
 they said to him
 \u201cEveryone is searching for you.\u201d ","He answered
 \u201cLet us go on to the neighboring towns
 so that I may proclaim the message there also; for that is what I came out to do.\u201d ","Moved with pity
 Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him
 and said to him
 \u201cI do choose. Be made clean!\u201d ","saying to him
 \u201cSee that you say nothing to anyone; but go
 show yourself to the priest
 and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded
 as a testimony to them.\u201d ","When Jesus saw their faith
 he said to the paralytic
 \u201cSon
 your sins are forgiven.\u201d ","At once Jesus perceived in his spirit that they were discussing these questions among themselves; and he said to them
 \u201cWhy do you raise such questions in your hearts? ","Which is easier
 to say to the paralytic
 \u2018Your sins are forgiven
\u2019 or to say
 \u2018Stand up and take your mat and walk\u2019? ","But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins\u201d\u2014he said to the paralytic\u2014","\u201cI say to you

 \u201cLook
 why are they doing what is not lawful on the sabbath?\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cHave you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need of food? ","Then he said to them

 since it had no depth of soil. ","And when the sun rose
 it was scorched; and since it had no root
 it withered away. ","Other seed fell among thorns
 and the thorns grew up and choked it
 and it yielded no grain. ","Other seed fell into good soil and brought forth grain
 growing up and increasing and yielding thirty and sixty and a hundredfold.\u201d ","And he said
 \u201cLet anyone with ears to hear listen!\u201d","And he said to them
 \u201cTo you has been given the secret of the kingdom of God
 but for those outside
 everything comes in parables; ","in order that \u2018they may indeed look
 but not perceive
 and may indeed listen
 but not understand; so that they may not turn again and be forgiven.\u2019\u201d","And he said to them
 \u201cDo you not understand this parable? Then how will you understand all the parables? ","The sower sows the word.","These are the ones on the path where the word is sown: when they hear
 Satan immediately comes and takes away the word that is sown in them. ","And these are the ones sown on rocky ground: when they hear the word
 they immediately receive it with joy. ","But they have no root
 and endure only for a while; then
 when trouble or persecution arises on account of the word
 immediately they fall away. ","And others are those sown among the thorns: these are the ones who hear the word
 ","but the cares of the world
 and the lure of wealth
 and the desire for other things come in and choke the word
 and it yields nothing. ","And these are the ones sown on the good soil: they hear the word and accept it and bear fruit
 thirty and sixty and a hundredfold.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cIs a lamp brought in to be put under the bushel basket
 or under the bed
 and not on the lampstand? ","For there is nothing hidden
 except to be disclosed; nor is anything secret
 except to come to light. ","Let anyone with ears to hear listen!\u201d","And he said to them
 \u201cPay attention to what you hear; the measure you give will be the measure you get
 and still more will be given you. ","For to those who have
 more will be given; and from those who have nothing
 even what they have will be taken away.\u201d","He also said
 \u201cThe kingdom of God is as if someone would scatter seed on the ground
 ","and would sleep and rise night and day
 and the seed would sprout and grow
 he does not know how. ","The earth produces of itself
 first the stalk
 then the head
 then the full grain in the head. ","But when the grain is ripe
 at once he goes in with his sickle
 because the harvest has come.\u201d","He also said
 \u201cWith what can we compare the kingdom of God
 or what parable will we use for it? ","It is like a mustard seed
 which
 when sown upon the ground
 is the smallest of all the seeds on earth; ","yet when it is sown it grows up and becomes the greatest of all shrubs
 and puts forth large branches
 so that the birds of the air can make nests in its shade.\u201d","On that day
 when evening had come
 he said to them
 \u201cLet us go across to the other side.\u201d ","He woke up and rebuked the wind
 and said to the sea
 \u201cPeace! Be still!\u201d Then the wind ceased
 and there was a dead calm. ","He said to them
 \u201cWhy are you afraid? Have you still no faith?\u201d ","For he had said to him
 \u201cCome out of the man
 you unclean spirit!\u201d ","Then Jesus asked him
 \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d He replied
 \u201cMy name is Legion; for we are many.\u201d ","But Jesus refused
 and said to him
 \u201cGo home to your friends
 and tell them how much the Lord has done for you
 and what mercy he has shown you.\u201d ","for she said
 \u201cIf I but touch his clothes
 I will be made well.\u201d ","And his disciples said to him
 \u201cYou see the crowd pressing in on you; how can you say
 \u2018Who touched me?\u2019\u201d ","He said to her
 \u201cDaughter
 your faith has made you well; go in peace
 and be healed of your disease.\u201d","But overhearing what they said
 Jesus said to the leader of the synagogue
 \u201cDo not fear
 only believe.\u201d ","When he had entered
 he said to them
 \u201cWhy do you make a commotion and weep? The child is not dead but sleeping.\u201d ","He took her by the hand and said to her
 \u201cTalitha cum
\u201d which means
 \u201cLittle girl
 get up!\u201d ","Then Jesus said to them
 \u201cProphets are not without honor
 except in their hometown
 and among their own kin
 and in their own house.\u201d ","He called the twelve and began to send them out two by two
 and gave them authority over the unclean spirits. ","He said to them
 \u201cWherever you enter a house
 stay there until you leave the place. ","If any place will not welcome you and they refuse to hear you
 as you leave
 shake off the dust that is on your feet as a testimony against them.\u201d ","But when Herod heard of it
 he said
 \u201cJohn
 whom I beheaded
 has been raised.\u201d","When his daughter Herodias came in and danced
 she pleased Herod and his guests; and the king said to the girl
 \u201cAsk me for whatever you wish
 and I will give it.\u201d ","She went out and said to her mother
 \u201cWhat should I ask for?\u201d She replied
 \u201cThe head of John the baptizer.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cCome away to a deserted place all by yourselves and rest a while.\u201d For many were coming and going
 and they had no leisure even to eat. ","But he answered them
 \u201cYou give them something to eat.\u201d They said to him
 \u201cAre we to go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread
 and give it to them to eat?\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cHow many loaves have you? Go and see.\u201d When they had found out
 they said
 \u201cFive
 and two fish.\u201d ","for they all saw him and were terrified. But immediately he spoke to them and said
 \u201cTake heart
 it is I; do not be afraid.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cIsaiah prophesied rightly about you hypocrites
 as it is written
 \u2018This people honors me with their lips
 but their hearts are far from me;","in vain do they worship me
 teaching human precepts as doctrines.\u2019","You abandon the commandment of God and hold to human tradition.\u201d","Then he said to them
 \u201cYou have a fine way of rejecting the commandment of God in order to keep your tradition! ","For Moses said
 \u2018Honor your father and your mother\u2019; and
 \u2018Whoever speaks evil of father or mother must surely die.\u2019 ","But you say that if anyone tells father or mother
 \u2018Whatever support you might have had from me is Corban\u2019 (that is
 an offering to God)\u2014 ","then you no longer permit doing anything for a father or mother
 ","thus making void the word of God through your tradition that you have handed on. And you do many things like this.\u201d","Then he called the crowd again and said to them
 \u201cListen to me
 all of you
 and understand: ","there is nothing outside a person that by going in can defile
 but the things that come out are what defile.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cThen do you also fail to understand? Do you not see that whatever goes into a person from outside cannot defile
 ","since it enters
 not the heart but the stomach
 and goes out into the sewer?\u201d (Thus he declared all foods clean.) ","And he said
 \u201cIt is what comes out of a person that defiles. ","For it is from within
 from the human heart
 that evil intentions come: fornication
 theft
 murder
 ","adultery
 avarice
 wickedness
 deceit
 licentiousness
 envy
 slander
 pride
 folly. ","All these evil things come from within
 and they defile a person.\u201d","He said to her
 \u201cLet the children be fed first
 for it is not fair to take the children\u2019s food and throw it to the dogs.\u201d ","Then he said to her
 \u201cFor saying that
 you may go\u2014the demon has left your daughter.\u201d ","Then looking up to heaven
 he sighed and said to him
 \u201cEphphatha
\u201d that is
 \u201cBe opened.\u201d ","In those days when there was again a great crowd without anything to eat
 he called his disciples and said to them
 ","\u201cI have compassion for the crowd
 because they have been with me now for three days and have nothing to eat. ","If I send them away hungry to their homes
 they will faint on the way\u2014and some of them have come from a great distance.\u201d ","He asked them
 \u201cHow many loaves do you have?\u201d They said
 \u201cSeven.\u201d ","And he sighed deeply in his spirit and said
 \u201cWhy does this generation ask for a sign? Truly I tell you
 no sign will be given to this generation.\u201d ","And he cautioned them
 saying
 \u201cWatch out\u2014beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod.\u201d ","And becoming aware of it
 Jesus said to them
 \u201cWhy are you talking about having no bread? Do you still not perceive or understand? Are your hearts hardened? ","Do you have eyes
 and fail to see? Do you have ears
 and fail to hear? And do you not remember? ","When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand
 how many baskets full of broken pieces did you collect?\u201d They said to him
 \u201cTwelve.\u201d ","\u201cAnd the seven for the four thousand
 how many baskets full of broken pieces did you collect?\u201d And they said to him
 \u201cSeven.\u201d ","Then he said to them
 \u201cDo you not yet understand?\u201d","He took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village; and when he had put saliva on his eyes and laid his hands on him
 he asked him
 \u201cCan you see anything?\u201d ","Then he sent him away to his home
 saying
 \u201cDo not even go into the village.\u201d","Jesus went on with his disciples to the villages of Caesarea Philippi; and on the way he asked his disciples
 \u201cWho do people say that I am?\u201d ","He asked them
 \u201cBut who do you say that I am?\u201d Peter answered him
 \u201cYou are the Messiah.\u201d ","But turning and looking at his disciples
 he rebuked Peter and said
 \u201cGet behind me
 Satan! For you are setting your mind not on divine things but on human things.\u201d","He called the crowd with his disciples
 and said to them
 \u201cIf any want to become my followers
 let them deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me. ","For those who want to save their life will lose it
 and those who lose their life for my sake
 and for the sake of the gospel
 will save it. ","For what will it profit them to gain the whole world and forfeit their life?","Indeed
 what can they give in return for their life? ","Those who are ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation
 of them the Son of Man will also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cTruly I tell you
 there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see that the kingdom of God has come with power.\u201d","Then Peter said to Jesus
 \u201cRabbi
 it is good for us to be here; let us make three dwellings
 one for you
 one for Moses
 and one for Elijah.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cElijah is indeed coming first to restore all things. How then is it written about the Son of Man
 that he is to go through many sufferings and be treated with contempt? ","But I tell you that Elijah has come
 and they did to him whatever they pleased
 as it is written about him.\u201d","He asked them
 \u201cWhat are you arguing about with them?\u201d ","He answered them
 \u201cYou faithless generation
 how much longer must I be among you? How much longer must I put up with you? Bring him to me.\u201d ","Jesus asked the father
 \u201cHow long has this been happening to him?\u201d And he said
 \u201cFrom childhood. ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cIf you are able!\u2014All things can be done for the one who believes.\u201d ","When Jesus saw that a crowd came running together
 he rebuked the unclean spirit
 saying to it
 \u201cYou spirit that keeps this boy from speaking and hearing
 I command you
 come out of him
 and never enter him again!\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cThis kind can come out only through prayer.\u201d","for he was teaching his disciples
 saying to them
 \u201cThe Son of Man is to be betrayed into human hands
 and they will kill him
 and three days after being killed
 he will rise again.\u201d ","Then they came to Capernaum; and when he was in the house he asked them
 \u201cWhat were you arguing about on the way?\u201d ","He sat down
 called the twelve
 and said to them
 \u201cWhoever wants to be first must be last of all and servant of all.\u201d ","Then he took a little child and put it among them; and taking it in his arms
 he said to them
 ","But Jesus said
 \u201cDo not stop him; for no one who does a deed of power in my name will be able soon afterward to speak evil of me. ","Whoever is not against us is for us.","For truly I tell you
 whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you bear the name of Christ will by no means lose the reward.","\u201cIf any of you put a stumbling block before one of these little ones who believe in me
 it would be better for you if a great millstone were hung around your neck and you were thrown into the sea. ","If your hand causes you to stumble
 cut it off; it is better for you to enter life maimed than to have two hands and to go to hell
 to the unquenchable fire. ","And if your foot causes you to stumble
 cut it off; it is better for you to enter life lame than to have two feet and to be thrown into hell. ","And if your eye causes you to stumble
 tear it out; it is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and to be thrown into hell
 ","where their worm never dies
 and the fire is never quenched.","\u201cFor everyone will be salted with fire.","Salt is good; but if salt has lost its saltiness
 how can you season it? Have salt in yourselves
 and be at peace with one another.\u201d","He answered them
 \u201cWhat did Moses command you?\u201d ","But Jesus said to them
 \u201cBecause of your hardness of heart he wrote this commandment for you. ","But from the beginning of creation
 \u2018God made them male and female.\u2019 ","\u2018For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife
 ","and the two shall become one flesh.\u2019 So they are no longer two
 but one flesh. ","Therefore what God has joined together
 let no one separate.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cWhoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her; ","and if she divorces her husband and marries another
 she commits adultery.\u201d","But when Jesus saw this
 he was indignant and said to them
 \u201cLet the little children come to me; do not stop them; for it is to such as these that the kingdom of God belongs. ","Truly I tell you
 whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will never enter it.\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cWhy do you call me good? No one is good but God alone. ","You know the commandments: \u2018You shall not murder; You shall not commit adultery; You shall not steal; You shall not bear false witness; You shall not defraud; Honor your father and mother.\u2019\u201d","He said to him
 \u201cTeacher
 I have kept all these since my youth.\u201d ","Jesus
 looking at him
 loved him and said
 \u201cYou lack one thing; go
 sell what you own
 and give the money to the poor
 and you will have treasure in heaven; then come
 follow me.\u201d ","Then Jesus looked around and said to his disciples
 \u201cHow hard it will be for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God!\u201d ","And the disciples were perplexed at these words. But Jesus said to them again
 \u201cChildren
 how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God! ","It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.\u201d","They were greatly astounded and said to one another
 \u201cThen who can be saved?\u201d ","Jesus looked at them and said
 \u201cFor mortals it is impossible
 but not for God; for God all things are possible.\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cTruly I tell you
 there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields
 for my sake and for the sake of the good news
 ","who will not receive a hundredfold now in this age\u2014houses
 brothers and sisters
 mothers and children
 and fields
 with persecutions\u2014and in the age to come eternal life. ","But many who are first will be last
 and the last will be first.\u201d","saying
 \u201cSee
 we are going up to Jerusalem
 and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the scribes
 and they will condemn him to death; then they will hand him over to the Gentiles; ","they will mock him
 and spit upon him
 and flog him
 and kill him; and after three days he will rise again.\u201d","James and John
 the sons of Zebedee
 came forward to him and said to him
 \u201cTeacher
 we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you.\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cWhat is it you want me to do for you?\u201d ","But Jesus said to them
 \u201cYou do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink
 or be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?\u201d ","They replied
 \u201cWe are able.\u201d Then Jesus said to them
 \u201cThe cup that I drink you will drink; and with the baptism with which I am baptized
 you will be baptized; ","but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant
 but it is for those for whom it has been prepared.\u201d","So Jesus called them and said to them
 \u201cYou know that among the Gentiles those whom they recognize as their rulers lord it over them
 and their great ones are tyrants over them. ","But it is not so among you; but whoever wishes to become great among you must be your servant
 ","and whoever wishes to be first among you must be slave of all.","For the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve
 and to give his life a ransom for many.\u201d","Jesus stood still and said
 \u201cCall him here.\u201d And they called the blind man

 \u201cTake heart; get up
 he is calling you.\u201d ","Then Jesus said to him
 \u201cWhat do you want me to do for you?\u201d The blind man said to him
 \u201cMy teacher
 let me see again.\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cGo; your faith has made you well.\u201d Immediately he regained his sight and followed him on the way.","and said to them
 \u201cGo into the village ahead of you
 and immediately as you enter it
 you will find tied there a colt that has never been ridden; untie it and bring it. ","If anyone says to you
 \u2018Why are you doing this?\u2019 just say this
 \u2018The Lord needs it and will send it back here immediately.\u2019\u201d ","He said to it
 \u201cMay no one ever eat fruit from you again.\u201d And his disciples heard it.","He was teaching and saying
 \u201cIs it not written
 \u2018My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations\u2019? But you have made it a den of robbers.\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cHave faith in God. ","Truly I tell you
 if you say to this mountain
 \u2018Be taken up and thrown into the sea
\u2019 and if you do not doubt in your heart

 whatever you ask for in prayer
 believe that you have received it
 and it will be yours.","\u201cWhenever you stand praying
 forgive
 if you have anything against anyone; so that your Father in heaven may also forgive you your trespasses.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cI will ask you one question; answer me
 and I will tell you by what authority I do these things. ","Did the baptism of John come from heaven
 or was it of human origin? Answer me.\u201d ","So they answered Jesus
 \u201cWe do not know.\u201d And Jesus said to them
 \u201cNeither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.\u201d","Then he began to speak to them in parables. \u201cA man planted a vineyard
 put a fence around it
 dug a pit for the wine press
 and built a watchtower; then he leased it to tenants and went to another country. ","When the season came
 he sent a slave to the tenants to collect from them his share of the produce of the vineyard. ","But they seized him
 and beat him
 and sent him away empty-handed. ","And again he sent another slave to them; this one they beat over the head and insulted.","Then he sent another

 saying
 \u2018They will respect my son.\u2019 ","But those tenants said to one another
 \u2018This is the heir; come
 let us kill him
 and the inheritance will be ours.\u2019 ","So they seized him
 killed him
 and threw him out of the vineyard. ","What then will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the tenants and give the vineyard to others.","Have you not read this scripture: \u2018The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone;","this was the Lord\u2019s doing

 \u201cIs not this the reason you are wrong

 but of the living; you are quite wrong.\u201d","One of the scribes came near and heard them disputing with one another

 \u201cWhich commandment is the first of all?\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cThe first is
 \u2018Hear
 O Israel: the Lord our God
 the Lord is one; ","you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart

 and with all your strength.\u2019 ","The second is this
 \u2018You shall love your neighbor as yourself.\u2019 There is no other commandment greater than these.\u201d ","When Jesus saw that he answered wisely

 \u201cYou are not far from the kingdom of God.\u201d After that no one dared to ask him any question.","While Jesus was teaching in the temple

 \u201cHow can the scribes say that the Messiah is the son of David? ","David himself

 until I put your enemies under your feet.\u201d\u2019","David himself calls him Lord; so how can he be his son?\u201d And the large crowd was listening to him with delight.","As he taught
 he said
 \u201cBeware of the scribes
 who like to walk around in long robes
 and to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces
 ","and to have the best seats in the synagogues and places of honor at banquets!","They devour widows\u2019 houses and for the sake of appearance say long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation.\u201d","Then he called his disciples and said to them
 \u201cTruly I tell you
 this poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the treasury. ","For all of them have contributed out of their abundance; but she out of her poverty has put in everything she had
 all she had to live on.\u201d","As he came out of the temple
 one of his disciples said to him
 \u201cLook

 \u201cDo you see these great buildings? Not one stone will be left here upon another; all will be thrown down.\u201d","Then Jesus began to say to them
 \u201cBeware that no one leads you astray. ","Many will come in my name and say
 \u2018I am he!\u2019 and they will lead many astray. ","When you hear of wars and rumors of wars
 do not be alarmed; this must take place
 but the end is still to come. ","For nation will rise against nation
 and kingdom against kingdom; there will be earthquakes in various places; there will be famines. This is but the beginning of the birth pangs.","\u201cAs for yourselves
 beware; for they will hand you over to councils; and you will be beaten in synagogues; and you will stand before governors and kings because of me
 as a testimony to them. ","And the good news must first be proclaimed to all nations.","When they bring you to trial and hand you over
 do not worry beforehand about what you are to say; but say whatever is given you at that time

 but the Holy Spirit. ","Brother will betray brother to death
 and a father his child
 and children will rise against parents and have them put to death; ","and you will be hated by all because of my name. But the one who endures to the end will be saved.","\u201cBut when you see the desolating sacrilege set up where it ought not to be (let the reader understand)
 then those in Judea must flee to the mountains; ","the one on the housetop must not go down or enter the house to take anything away;","the one in the field must not turn back to get a coat.","Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing infants in those days!","Pray that it may not be in winter.","For in those days there will be suffering
 such as has not been from the beginning of the creation that God created until now
 no
 and never will be. ","And if the Lord had not cut short those days
 no one would be saved; but for the sake of the elect

 he has cut short those days. ","And if anyone says to you at that time

 to lead astray

 the elect. ","But be alert; I have already told you everything.","\u201cBut in those days
 after that suffering
 the sun will be darkened
 and the moon will not give its light
","and the stars will be falling from heaven
 and the powers in the heavens will be shaken.","Then they will see \u2018the Son of Man coming in clouds\u2019 with great power and glory.","Then he will send out the angels
 and gather his elect from the four winds
 from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven.","\u201cFrom the fig tree learn its lesson: as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts forth its leaves

 this generation will not pass away until all these things have taken place. ","Heaven and earth will pass away
 but my words will not pass away.","\u201cBut about that day or hour no one knows
 neither the angels in heaven

 keep alert; for you do not know when the time will come. ","It is like a man going on a journey

 each with his work
 and commands the doorkeeper to be on the watch. ","Therefore
 keep awake\u2014for you do not know when the master of the house will come
 in the evening
 or at midnight
 or at cockcrow
 or at dawn
 ","or else he may find you asleep when he comes suddenly.","And what I say to you I say to all: Keep awake.\u201d","But some were there who said to one another in anger
 \u201cWhy was the ointment wasted in this way? ","But Jesus said
 \u201cLet her alone; why do you trouble her? She has performed a good service for me. ","For you always have the poor with you
 and you can show kindness to them whenever you wish; but you will not always have me. ","She has done what she could; she has anointed my body beforehand for its burial.","Truly I tell you
 wherever the good news is proclaimed in the whole world
 what she has done will be told in remembrance of her.\u201d","So he sent two of his disciples
 saying to them
 \u201cGo into the city
 and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you; follow him
 ","and wherever he enters
 say to the owner of the house
 \u2018The Teacher asks
 Where is my guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?\u2019 ","He will show you a large room upstairs
 furnished and ready. Make preparations for us there.\u201d ","And when they had taken their places and were eating
 Jesus said
 \u201cTruly I tell you
 one of you will betray me
 one who is eating with me.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cIt is one of the twelve
 one who is dipping bread into the bowl with me. ","For the Son of Man goes as it is written of him
 but woe to that one by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that one not to have been born.\u201d","While they were eating
 he took a loaf of bread
 and after blessing it he broke it
 gave it to them
 and said
 \u201cTake; this is my body.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cThis is my blood of the covenant
 which is poured out for many. ","Truly I tell you
 I will never again drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.\u201d","And Jesus said to them
 \u201cYou will all become deserters; for it is written
 \u2018I will strike the shepherd
 and the sheep will be scattered.\u2019","But after I am raised up
 I will go before you to Galilee.\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cTruly I tell you
 this day
 this very night
 before the cock crows twice
 you will deny me three times.\u201d ","They went to a place called Gethsemane; and he said to his disciples
 \u201cSit here while I pray.\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cI am deeply grieved
 even to death; remain here
 and keep awake.\u201d ","He said
 \u201cAbba
 Father
 for you all things are possible; remove this cup from me; yet
 not what I want
 but what you want.\u201d ","He came and found them sleeping; and he said to Peter
 \u201cSimon
 are you asleep? Could you not keep awake one hour? ","Keep awake and pray that you may not come into the time of trial; the spirit indeed is willing
 but the flesh is weak.\u201d ","He came a third time and said to them
 \u201cAre you still sleeping and taking your rest? Enough! The hour has come; the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. ","Get up
 let us be going. See
 my betrayer is at hand.\u201d","Then Jesus said to them
 \u201cHave you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me as though I were a bandit? ","Day after day I was with you in the temple teaching
 and you did not arrest me. But let the scriptures be fulfilled.\u201d ","Jesus said
 \u201cI am; and \u2018you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Power
\u2019 and \u2018coming with the clouds of heaven.\u2019\u201d","Some began to spit on him
 to blindfold him
 and to strike him
 saying to him
 \u201cProphesy!\u201d The guards also took him over and beat him.","At that moment the cock crowed for the second time. Then Peter remembered that Jesus had said to him
 \u201cBefore the cock crows twice
 you will deny me three times.\u201d And he broke down and wept.","Pilate asked him
 \u201cAre you the King of the Jews?\u201d He answered him
 \u201cYou say so.\u201d ","Then he answered them
 \u201cDo you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?\u201d ","At three o\u2019clock Jesus cried out with a loud voice
 \u201cEloi
 Eloi

 \u201cMy God
 my God

 who stood facing him
 saw that in this way he breathed his last
 he said
 \u201cTruly this man was God\u2019s Son!\u201d","Then Pilate wondered if he were already dead; and summoning the centurion
 he asked him whether he had been dead for some time. ","They had been saying to one another
 \u201cWho will roll away the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb?\u201d ","But he said to them
 \u201cDo not be alarmed; you are looking for Jesus of Nazareth
 who was crucified. He has been raised; he is not here. Look
 there is the place they laid him. ","And he said to them
 \u201cGo into all the world and proclaim the good news to the whole creation. ","The one who believes and is baptized will be saved; but the one who does not believe will be condemned.","And these signs will accompany those who believe: by using my name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues;","they will pick up snakes in their hands
 and if they drink any deadly thing
 it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick
 and they will recover.\u201d","The beginning of the good news of Jesus Christ
 the Son of God.","and saying
 \u201cThe time is fulfilled
 and the kingdom of God has come near; repent
 and believe in the good news.\u201d","And Jesus said to them
 \u201cFollow me and I will make you fish for people.\u201d ","But Jesus rebuked him
 saying
 \u201cBe silent
 and come out of him!\u201d ","When they found him
 they said to him
 \u201cEveryone is searching for you.\u201d ","He answered
 \u201cLet us go on to the neighboring towns
 so that I may proclaim the message there also; for that is what I came out to do.\u201d ","Moved with pity
 Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him
 and said to him
 \u201cI do choose. Be made clean!\u201d ","saying to him
 \u201cSee that you say nothing to anyone; but go
 show yourself to the priest
 and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded
 as a testimony to them.\u201d ","When Jesus saw their faith
 he said to the paralytic
 \u201cSon
 your sins are forgiven.\u201d ","At once Jesus perceived in his spirit that they were discussing these questions among themselves; and he said to them
 \u201cWhy do you raise such questions in your hearts? ","Which is easier
 to say to the paralytic
 \u2018Your sins are forgiven
\u2019 or to say
 \u2018Stand up and take your mat and walk\u2019? ","But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins\u201d\u2014he said to the paralytic\u2014","\u201cI say to you
 stand up
 take your mat and go to your home.\u201d ","As he was walking along
 he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax booth
 and he said to him
 \u201cFollow me.\u201d And he got up and followed him.","When Jesus heard this
 he said to them
 \u201cThose who are well have no need of a physician
 but those who are sick; I have come to call not the righteous but sinners.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cThe wedding guests cannot fast while the bridegroom is with them
 can they? As long as they have the bridegroom with them
 they cannot fast. ","The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them
 and then they will fast on that day.","\u201cNo one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old cloak; otherwise
 the patch pulls away from it
 the new from the old
 and a worse tear is made. ","And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; otherwise
 the wine will burst the skins
 and the wine is lost
 and so are the skins; but one puts new wine into fresh wineskins.\u201d","The Pharisees said to him
 \u201cLook
 why are they doing what is not lawful on the sabbath?\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cHave you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need of food? ","Then he said to them
 \u201cThe sabbath was made for humankind
 and not humankind for the sabbath; ","so the Son of Man is lord even of the sabbath.\u201d","And he said to the man who had the withered hand
 \u201cCome forward.\u201d ","Then he said to them
 \u201cIs it lawful to do good or to do harm on the sabbath
 to save life or to kill?\u201d But they were silent. ","He looked around at them with anger; he was grieved at their hardness of heart and said to the man
 \u201cStretch out your hand.\u201d He stretched it out
 and his hand was restored. ","And he called them to him
 and spoke to them in parables
 \u201cHow can Satan cast out Satan? ","If a kingdom is divided against itself
 that kingdom cannot stand. ","And if a house is divided against itself
 that house will not be able to stand. ","And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided
 he cannot stand

 people will be forgiven for their sins and whatever blasphemies they utter; ","but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit can never have forgiveness
 but is guilty of an eternal sin\u201d\u2014 ","A crowd was sitting around him; and they said to him
 \u201cYour mother and your brothers and sisters are outside
 asking for you.\u201d ","And he replied
 \u201cWho are my mother and my brothers?\u201d ","And looking at those who sat around him
 he said
 \u201cHere are my mother and my brothers! ","Whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother.\u201d","He began to teach them many things in parables
 and in his teaching he said to them: ","\u201cListen! A sower went out to sow.","And as he sowed
 some seed fell on the path
 and the birds came and ate it up. ","Other seed fell on rocky ground
 where it did not have much soil
 and it sprang up quickly
 since it had no depth of soil. ","And when the sun rose
 it was scorched; and since it had no root
 it withered away. ","Other seed fell among thorns
 and the thorns grew up and choked it
 and it yielded no grain. ","Other seed fell into good soil and brought forth grain
 growing up and increasing and yielding thirty and sixty and a hundredfold.\u201d ","And he said
 \u201cLet anyone with ears to hear listen!\u201d","And he said to them
 \u201cTo you has been given the secret of the kingdom of God
 but for those outside
 everything comes in parables; ","in order that \u2018they may indeed look
 but not perceive
 and may indeed listen
 but not understand; so that they may not turn again and be forgiven.\u2019\u201d","And he said to them
 \u201cDo you not understand this parable? Then how will you understand all the parables? ","The sower sows the word.","These are the ones on the path where the word is sown: when they hear
 Satan immediately comes and takes away the word that is sown in them. ","And these are the ones sown on rocky ground: when they hear the word
 they immediately receive it with joy. ","But they have no root
 and endure only for a while; then
 when trouble or persecution arises on account of the word
 immediately they fall away. ","And others are those sown among the thorns: these are the ones who hear the word
 ","but the cares of the world
 and the lure of wealth
 and the desire for other things come in and choke the word
 and it yields nothing. ","And these are the ones sown on the good soil: they hear the word and accept it and bear fruit
 thirty and sixty and a hundredfold.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cIs a lamp brought in to be put under the bushel basket
 or under the bed
 and not on the lampstand? ","For there is nothing hidden
 except to be disclosed; nor is anything secret
 except to come to light. ","Let anyone with ears to hear listen!\u201d","And he said to them
 \u201cPay attention to what you hear; the measure you give will be the measure you get
 and still more will be given you. ","For to those who have
 more will be given; and from those who have nothing
 even what they have will be taken away.\u201d","He also said
 \u201cThe kingdom of God is as if someone would scatter seed on the ground
 ","and would sleep and rise night and day
 and the seed would sprout and grow
 he does not know how. ","The earth produces of itself
 first the stalk
 then the head
 then the full grain in the head. ","But when the grain is ripe
 at once he goes in with his sickle
 because the harvest has come.\u201d","He also said
 \u201cWith what can we compare the kingdom of God
 or what parable will we use for it? ","It is like a mustard seed
 which
 when sown upon the ground
 is the smallest of all the seeds on earth; ","yet when it is sown it grows up and becomes the greatest of all shrubs
 and puts forth large branches
 so that the birds of the air can make nests in its shade.\u201d","On that day
 when evening had come
 he said to them
 \u201cLet us go across to the other side.\u201d ","He woke up and rebuked the wind
 and said to the sea
 \u201cPeace! Be still!\u201d Then the wind ceased
 and there was a dead calm. ","He said to them
 \u201cWhy are you afraid? Have you still no faith?\u201d ","For he had said to him
 \u201cCome out of the man
 you unclean spirit!\u201d ","Then Jesus asked him
 \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d He replied
 \u201cMy name is Legion; for we are many.\u201d ","But Jesus refused
 and said to him
 \u201cGo home to your friends
 and tell them how much the Lord has done for you
 and what mercy he has shown you.\u201d ","for she said
 \u201cIf I but touch his clothes
 I will be made well.\u201d ","And his disciples said to him
 \u201cYou see the crowd pressing in on you; how can you say
 \u2018Who touched me?\u2019\u201d ","He said to her
 \u201cDaughter
 your faith has made you well; go in peace
 and be healed of your disease.\u201d","But overhearing what they said
 Jesus said to the leader of the synagogue
 \u201cDo not fear
 only believe.\u201d ","When he had entered
 he said to them
 \u201cWhy do you make a commotion and weep? The child is not dead but sleeping.\u201d ","He took her by the hand and said to her
 \u201cTalitha cum
\u201d which means
 \u201cLittle girl
 get up!\u201d ","Then Jesus said to them
 \u201cProphets are not without honor
 except in their hometown
 and among their own kin
 and in their own house.\u201d ","He called the twelve and began to send them out two by two
 and gave them authority over the unclean spirits. ","He said to them
 \u201cWherever you enter a house
 stay there until you leave the place. ","If any place will not welcome you and they refuse to hear you
 as you leave
 shake off the dust that is on your feet as a testimony against them.\u201d ","But when Herod heard of it
 he said
 \u201cJohn
 whom I beheaded
 has been raised.\u201d","When his daughter Herodias came in and danced
 she pleased Herod and his guests; and the king said to the girl
 \u201cAsk me for whatever you wish
 and I will give it.\u201d ","She went out and said to her mother
 \u201cWhat should I ask for?\u201d She replied
 \u201cThe head of John the baptizer.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cCome away to a deserted place all by yourselves and rest a while.\u201d For many were coming and going
 and they had no leisure even to eat. ","But he answered them
 \u201cYou give them something to eat.\u201d They said to him
 \u201cAre we to go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread
 and give it to them to eat?\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cHow many loaves have you? Go and see.\u201d When they had found out
 they said
 \u201cFive
 and two fish.\u201d ","for they all saw him and were terrified. But immediately he spoke to them and said
 \u201cTake heart
 it is I; do not be afraid.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cIsaiah prophesied rightly about you hypocrites
 as it is written
 \u2018This people honors me with their lips
 but their hearts are far from me;","in vain do they worship me
 teaching human precepts as doctrines.\u2019","You abandon the commandment of God and hold to human tradition.\u201d","Then he said to them
 \u201cYou have a fine way of rejecting the commandment of God in order to keep your tradition! ","For Moses said
 \u2018Honor your father and your mother\u2019; and
 \u2018Whoever speaks evil of father or mother must surely die.\u2019 ","But you say that if anyone tells father or mother
 \u2018Whatever support you might have had from me is Corban\u2019 (that is
 an offering to God)\u2014 ","then you no longer permit doing anything for a father or mother
 ","thus making void the word of God through your tradition that you have handed on. And you do many things like this.\u201d","Then he called the crowd again and said to them
 \u201cListen to me
 all of you
 and understand: ","there is nothing outside a person that by going in can defile
 but the things that come out are what defile.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cThen do you also fail to understand? Do you not see that whatever goes into a person from outside cannot defile
 ","since it enters
 not the heart but the stomach
 and goes out into the sewer?\u201d (Thus he declared all foods clean.) ","And he said
 \u201cIt is what comes out of a person that defiles. ","For it is from within
 from the human heart
 that evil intentions come: fornication
 theft
 murder
 ","adultery
 avarice
 wickedness
 deceit
 licentiousness
 envy
 slander
 pride
 folly. ","All these evil things come from within
 and they defile a person.\u201d","He said to her
 \u201cLet the children be fed first
 for it is not fair to take the children\u2019s food and throw it to the dogs.\u201d ","Then he said to her
 \u201cFor saying that
 you may go\u2014the demon has left your daughter.\u201d ","Then looking up to heaven
 he sighed and said to him
 \u201cEphphatha
\u201d that is
 \u201cBe opened.\u201d ","In those days when there was again a great crowd without anything to eat
 he called his disciples and said to them
 ","\u201cI have compassion for the crowd
 because they have been with me now for three days and have nothing to eat. ","If I send them away hungry to their homes
 they will faint on the way\u2014and some of them have come from a great distance.\u201d ","He asked them
 \u201cHow many loaves do you have?\u201d They said
 \u201cSeven.\u201d ","And he sighed deeply in his spirit and said
 \u201cWhy does this generation ask for a sign? Truly I tell you
 no sign will be given to this generation.\u201d ","And he cautioned them
 saying
 \u201cWatch out\u2014beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod.\u201d ","And becoming aware of it
 Jesus said to them
 \u201cWhy are you talking about having no bread? Do you still not perceive or understand? Are your hearts hardened? ","Do you have eyes
 and fail to see? Do you have ears
 and fail to hear? And do you not remember? ","When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand
 how many baskets full of broken pieces did you collect?\u201d They said to him
 \u201cTwelve.\u201d ","\u201cAnd the seven for the four thousand
 how many baskets full of broken pieces did you collect?\u201d And they said to him
 \u201cSeven.\u201d ","Then he said to them
 \u201cDo you not yet understand?\u201d","He took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village; and when he had put saliva on his eyes and laid his hands on him
 he asked him
 \u201cCan you see anything?\u201d ","Then he sent him away to his home
 saying
 \u201cDo not even go into the village.\u201d","Jesus went on with his disciples to the villages of Caesarea Philippi; and on the way he asked his disciples
 \u201cWho do people say that I am?\u201d ","He asked them
 \u201cBut who do you say that I am?\u201d Peter answered him
 \u201cYou are the Messiah.\u201d ","But turning and looking at his disciples
 he rebuked Peter and said
 \u201cGet behind me
 Satan! For you are setting your mind not on divine things but on human things.\u201d","He called the crowd with his disciples
 and said to them
 \u201cIf any want to become my followers
 let them deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me. ","For those who want to save their life will lose it
 and those who lose their life for my sake
 and for the sake of the gospel
 will save it. ","For what will it profit them to gain the whole world and forfeit their life?","Indeed
 what can they give in return for their life? ","Those who are ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation
 of them the Son of Man will also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cTruly I tell you
 there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see that the kingdom of God has come with power.\u201d","Then Peter said to Jesus
 \u201cRabbi
 it is good for us to be here; let us make three dwellings
 one for you
 one for Moses
 and one for Elijah.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cElijah is indeed coming first to restore all things. How then is it written about the Son of Man
 that he is to go through many sufferings and be treated with contempt? ","But I tell you that Elijah has come
 and they did to him whatever they pleased
 as it is written about him.\u201d","He asked them
 \u201cWhat are you arguing about with them?\u201d ","He answered them
 \u201cYou faithless generation
 how much longer must I be among you? How much longer must I put up with you? Bring him to me.\u201d ","Jesus asked the father
 \u201cHow long has this been happening to him?\u201d And he said
 \u201cFrom childhood. ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cIf you are able!\u2014All things can be done for the one who believes.\u201d ","When Jesus saw that a crowd came running together
 he rebuked the unclean spirit
 saying to it
 \u201cYou spirit that keeps this boy from speaking and hearing
 I command you
 come out of him
 and never enter him again!\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cThis kind can come out only through prayer.\u201d","for he was teaching his disciples
 saying to them
 \u201cThe Son of Man is to be betrayed into human hands

 and three days after being killed
 he will rise again.\u201d ","Then they came to Capernaum; and when he was in the house he asked them
 \u201cWhat were you arguing about on the way?\u201d ","He sat down
 called the twelve
 and said to them
 \u201cWhoever wants to be first must be last of all and servant of all.\u201d ","Then he took a little child and put it among them; and taking it in his arms
 he said to them
 ","But Jesus said
 \u201cDo not stop him; for no one who does a deed of power in my name will be able soon afterward to speak evil of me. ","Whoever is not against us is for us.","For truly I tell you
 whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you bear the name of Christ will by no means lose the reward.","\u201cIf any of you put a stumbling block before one of these little ones who believe in me
 it would be better for you if a great millstone were hung around your neck and you were thrown into the sea. ","If your hand causes you to stumble
 cut it off; it is better for you to enter life maimed than to have two hands and to go to hell
 to the unquenchable fire. ","And if your foot causes you to stumble
 cut it off; it is better for you to enter life lame than to have two feet and to be thrown into hell. ","And if your eye causes you to stumble
 tear it out; it is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and to be thrown into hell
 ","where their worm never dies
 and the fire is never quenched.","\u201cFor everyone will be salted with fire.","Salt is good; but if salt has lost its saltiness
 how can you season it? Have salt in yourselves

 \u201cWhat did Moses command you?\u201d ","But Jesus said to them
 \u201cBecause of your hardness of heart he wrote this commandment for you. ","But from the beginning of creation
 \u2018God made them male and female.\u2019 ","\u2018For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife
 ","and the two shall become one flesh.\u2019 So they are no longer two
 but one flesh. ","Therefore what God has joined together
 let no one separate.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cWhoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her; ","and if she divorces her husband and marries another
 she commits adultery.\u201d","But when Jesus saw this
 he was indignant and said to them
 \u201cLet the little children come to me; do not stop them; for it is to such as these that the kingdom of God belongs. ","Truly I tell you
 whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will never enter it.\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cWhy do you call me good? No one is good but God alone. ","You know the commandments: \u2018You shall not murder; You shall not commit adultery; You shall not steal; You shall not bear false witness; You shall not defraud; Honor your father and mother.\u2019\u201d","He said to him
 \u201cTeacher
 I have kept all these since my youth.\u201d ","Jesus
 looking at him
 loved him and said

 sell what you own

 \u201cHow hard it will be for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God!\u201d ","And the disciples were perplexed at these words. But Jesus said to them again

 we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you.\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cWhat is it you want me to do for you?\u201d ","But Jesus said to them
 \u201cYou do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink
 or be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?\u201d ","They replied
 \u201cWe are able.\u201d Then Jesus said to them
 \u201cThe cup that I drink you will drink; and with the baptism with which I am baptized
 you will be baptized; ","but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant
 but it is for those for whom it has been prepared.\u201d","So Jesus called them and said to them
 \u201cYou know that among the Gentiles those whom they recognize as their rulers lord it over them
 and their great ones are tyrants over them. ","But it is not so among you; but whoever wishes to become great among you must be your servant
 ","and whoever wishes to be first among you must be slave of all.","For the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve
 and to give his life a ransom for many.\u201d","Jesus stood still and said
 \u201cCall him here.\u201d And they called the blind man
 saying to him
 \u201cTake heart; get up
 he is calling you.\u201d ","Then Jesus said to him
 \u201cWhat do you want me to do for you?\u201d The blind man said to him
 \u201cMy teacher
 let me see again.\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cGo; your faith has made you well.\u201d Immediately he regained his sight and followed him on the way.","and said to them
 \u201cGo into the village ahead of you
 and immediately as you enter it
 you will find tied there a colt that has never been ridden; untie it and bring it. ","If anyone says to you
 \u2018Why are you doing this?\u2019 just say this
 \u2018The Lord needs it and will send it back here immediately.\u2019\u201d ","He said to it
 \u201cMay no one ever eat fruit from you again.\u201d And his disciples heard it.","He was teaching and saying
 \u201cIs it not written
 \u2018My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations\u2019? But you have made it a den of robbers.\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cHave faith in God. ","Truly I tell you
 if you say to this mountain
 \u2018Be taken up and thrown into the sea
\u2019 and if you do not doubt in your heart
 but believe that what you say will come to pass
 it will be done for you. ","So I tell you
 whatever you ask for in prayer
 believe that you have received it
 and it will be yours.","\u201cWhenever you stand praying
 forgive
 if you have anything against anyone; so that your Father in heaven may also forgive you your trespasses.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cI will ask you one question; answer me
 and I will tell you by what authority I do these things. ","Did the baptism of John come from heaven
 or was it of human origin? Answer me.\u201d ","So they answered Jesus
 \u201cWe do not know.\u201d And Jesus said to them
 \u201cNeither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.\u201d","Then he began to speak to them in parables. \u201cA man planted a vineyard
 put a fence around it
 dug a pit for the wine press
 and built a watchtower; then he leased it to tenants and went to another country. ","When the season came
 he sent a slave to the tenants to collect from them his share of the produce of the vineyard. ","But they seized him
 and beat him
 and sent him away empty-handed. ","And again he sent another slave to them; this one they beat over the head and insulted.","Then he sent another
 and that one they killed. And so it was with many others; some they beat
 and others they killed. ","He had still one other
 a beloved son. Finally he sent him to them
 saying
 \u2018They will respect my son.\u2019 ","But those tenants said to one another
 \u2018This is the heir; come
 let us kill him
 and the inheritance will be ours.\u2019 ","So they seized him
 killed him
 and threw him out of the vineyard. ","What then will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the tenants and give the vineyard to others.","Have you not read this scripture: \u2018The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone;","this was the Lord\u2019s doing
 and it is amazing in our eyes\u2019?\u201d","Then they sent to him some Pharisees and some Herodians to trap him in what he said.","Should we pay them
 or should we not?\u201d But knowing their hypocrisy
 he said to them
 \u201cWhy are you putting me to the test? Bring me a denarius and let me see it.\u201d ","And they brought one. Then he said to them
 \u201cWhose head is this
 and whose title?\u201d They answered
 \u201cThe emperor\u2019s.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cGive to the emperor the things that are the emperor\u2019s
 and to God the things that are God\u2019s.\u201d And they were utterly amazed at him.","Jesus said to them
 \u201cIs not this the reason you are wrong
 that you know neither the scriptures nor the power of God? ","For when they rise from the dead
 they neither marry nor are given in marriage
 but are like angels in heaven. ","And as for the dead being raised
 have you not read in the book of Moses
 in the story about the bush
 how God said to him
 \u2018I am the God of Abraham
 the God of Isaac
 and the God of Jacob\u2019? ","He is God not of the dead
 but of the living; you are quite wrong.\u201d","One of the scribes came near and heard them disputing with one another
 and seeing that he answered them well
 he asked him
 \u201cWhich commandment is the first of all?\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cThe first is
 \u2018Hear
 O Israel: the Lord our God
 the Lord is one; ","you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart
 and with all your soul
 and with all your mind
 and with all your strength.\u2019 ","The second is this
 \u2018You shall love your neighbor as yourself.\u2019 There is no other commandment greater than these.\u201d ","When Jesus saw that he answered wisely
 he said to him
 \u201cYou are not far from the kingdom of God.\u201d After that no one dared to ask him any question.","While Jesus was teaching in the temple
 he said
 \u201cHow can the scribes say that the Messiah is the son of David? ","David himself
 by the Holy Spirit
 declared
 \u2018The Lord said to my Lord
 \u201cSit at my right hand
 until I put your enemies under your feet.\u201d\u2019","David himself calls him Lord; so how can he be his son?\u201d And the large crowd was listening to him with delight.","As he taught
 he said
 \u201cBeware of the scribes
 who like to walk around in long robes
 and to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces
 ","and to have the best seats in the synagogues and places of honor at banquets!","They devour widows\u2019 houses and for the sake of appearance say long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation.\u201d","Then he called his disciples and said to them
 \u201cTruly I tell you
 this poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the treasury. ","For all of them have contributed out of their abundance; but she out of her poverty has put in everything she had
 all she had to live on.\u201d","As he came out of the temple
 one of his disciples said to him
 \u201cLook
 Teacher
 what large stones and what large buildings!\u201d ","Then Jesus asked him
 \u201cDo you see these great buildings? Not one stone will be left here upon another; all will be thrown down.\u201d","Then Jesus began to say to them
 \u201cBeware that no one leads you astray. ","Many will come in my name and say
 \u2018I am he!\u2019 and they will lead many astray. ","When you hear of wars and rumors of wars
 do not be alarmed; this must take place
 but the end is still to come. ","For nation will rise against nation
 and kingdom against kingdom; there will be earthquakes in various places; there will be famines. This is but the beginning of the birth pangs.","\u201cAs for yourselves
 beware; for they will hand you over to councils; and you will be beaten in synagogues; and you will stand before governors and kings because of me
 as a testimony to them. ","And the good news must first be proclaimed to all nations.","When they bring you to trial and hand you over
 do not worry beforehand about what you are to say; but say whatever is given you at that time
 for it is not you who speak
 but the Holy Spirit. ","Brother will betray brother to death
 and a father his child
 and children will rise against parents and have them put to death; ","and you will be hated by all because of my name. But the one who endures to the end will be saved.","\u201cBut when you see the desolating sacrilege set up where it ought not to be (let the reader understand)
 then those in Judea must flee to the mountains; ","the one on the housetop must not go down or enter the house to take anything away;","the one in the field must not turn back to get a coat.","Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing infants in those days!","Pray that it may not be in winter.","For in those days there will be suffering
 such as has not been from the beginning of the creation that God created until now
 no
 and never will be. ","And if the Lord had not cut short those days
 no one would be saved; but for the sake of the elect
 whom he chose
 he has cut short those days. ","And if anyone says to you at that time
 \u2018Look! Here is the Messiah!\u2019 or \u2018Look! There he is!\u2019\u2014do not believe it. ","False messiahs and false prophets will appear and produce signs and omens
 to lead astray
 if possible
 the elect. ","But be alert; I have already told you everything.","\u201cBut in those days
 after that suffering
 the sun will be darkened
 and the moon will not give its light
","and the stars will be falling from heaven
 and the powers in the heavens will be shaken.","Then they will see \u2018the Son of Man coming in clouds\u2019 with great power and glory.","Then he will send out the angels
 and gather his elect from the four winds
 from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven.","\u201cFrom the fig tree learn its lesson: as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts forth its leaves
 you know that summer is near. ","So also
 when you see these things taking place
 you know that he is near
 at the very gates. ","Truly I tell you
 this generation will not pass away until all these things have taken place. ","Heaven and earth will pass away
 but my words will not pass away.","\u201cBut about that day or hour no one knows
 neither the angels in heaven
 nor the Son
 but only the Father. ","Beware
 keep alert; for you do not know when the time will come. ","It is like a man going on a journey
 when he leaves home and puts his slaves in charge
 each with his work
 and commands the doorkeeper to be on the watch. ","Therefore
 keep awake\u2014for you do not know when the master of the house will come
 in the evening
 or at midnight
 or at cockcrow
 or at dawn
 ","or else he may find you asleep when he comes suddenly.","And what I say to you I say to all: Keep awake.\u201d","But some were there who said to one another in anger
 \u201cWhy was the ointment wasted in this way? ","But Jesus said
 \u201cLet her alone; why do you trouble her? She has performed a good service for me. ","For you always have the poor with you
 and you can show kindness to them whenever you wish; but you will not always have me. ","She has done what she could; she has anointed my body beforehand for its burial.","Truly I tell you
 wherever the good news is proclaimed in the whole world
 what she has done will be told in remembrance of her.\u201d","So he sent two of his disciples
 saying to them
 \u201cGo into the city
 and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you; follow him
 ","and wherever he enters
 say to the owner of the house
 \u2018The Teacher asks
 Where is my guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?\u2019 ","He will show you a large room upstairs
 furnished and ready. Make preparations for us there.\u201d ","And when they had taken their places and were eating
 Jesus said
 \u201cTruly I tell you
 one of you will betray me
 one who is eating with me.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cIt is one of the twelve
 one who is dipping bread into the bowl with me. ","For the Son of Man goes as it is written of him
 but woe to that one by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that one not to have been born.\u201d","While they were eating
 he took a loaf of bread
 and after blessing it he broke it
 gave it to them
 and said
 \u201cTake; this is my body.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cThis is my blood of the covenant
 which is poured out for many. ","Truly I tell you
 I will never again drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.\u201d","And Jesus said to them
 \u201cYou will all become deserters; for it is written
 \u2018I will strike the shepherd
 and the sheep will be scattered.\u2019","But after I am raised up
 I will go before you to Galilee.\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cTruly I tell you
 this day
 this very night
 before the cock crows twice
 you will deny me three times.\u201d ","They went to a place called Gethsemane; and he said to his disciples
 \u201cSit here while I pray.\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cI am deeply grieved
 even to death; remain here
 and keep awake.\u201d ","He said
 \u201cAbba
 Father
 for you all things are possible; remove this cup from me; yet
 not what I want
 but what you want.\u201d ","He came and found them sleeping; and he said to Peter
 \u201cSimon
 are you asleep? Could you not keep awake one hour? ","Keep awake and pray that you may not come into the time of trial; the spirit indeed is willing
 but the flesh is weak.\u201d ","He came a third time and said to them
 \u201cAre you still sleeping and taking your rest? Enough! The hour has come; the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. ","Get up
 let us be going. See
 my betrayer is at hand.\u201d","Then Jesus said to them
 \u201cHave you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me as though I were a bandit? ","Day after day I was with you in the temple teaching
 and you did not arrest me. But let the scriptures be fulfilled.\u201d ","Jesus said
 \u201cI am; and \u2018you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Power
\u2019 and \u2018coming with the clouds of heaven.\u2019\u201d","Some began to spit on him
 to blindfold him
 and to strike him
 saying to him
 \u201cProphesy!\u201d The guards also took him over and beat him.","At that moment the cock crowed for the second time. Then Peter remembered that Jesus had said to him
 \u201cBefore the cock crows twice
 you will deny me three times.\u201d And he broke down and wept.","Pilate asked him
 \u201cAre you the King of the Jews?\u201d He answered him
 \u201cYou say so.\u201d ","Then he answered them
 \u201cDo you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?\u201d ","At three o\u2019clock Jesus cried out with a loud voice
 \u201cEloi
 Eloi
 lema sabachthani?\u201d which means
 \u201cMy God
 my God
 why have you forsaken me?\u201d ","Now when the centurion
 who stood facing him
 saw that in this way he breathed his last
 he said
 \u201cTruly this man was God\u2019s Son!\u201d","Then Pilate wondered if he were already dead; and summoning the centurion
 he asked him whether he had been dead for some time. ","They had been saying to one another
 \u201cWho will roll away the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb?\u201d ","But he said to them
 \u201cDo not be alarmed; you are looking for Jesus of Nazareth
 who was crucified. He has been raised; he is not here. Look
 there is the place they laid him. ","And he said to them
 \u201cGo into all the world and proclaim the good news to the whole creation. ","The one who believes and is baptized will be saved; but the one who does not believe will be condemned.","And these signs will accompany those who believe: by using my name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues;","they will pick up snakes in their hands
 and if they drink any deadly thing
 it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick
 and they will recover.\u201d","The beginning of the good news of Jesus Christ
 the Son of God.","and saying
 \u2018The time is fulfilled
 and the kingdom of God has come near; repent
 and believe in the good news.\u2019","And Jesus said to them
 \u2018Follow me and I will make you fish for people.\u2019 ","But Jesus rebuked him
 saying
 \u2018Be silent
 and come out of him!\u2019 ","When they found him
 they said to him
 \u2018Everyone is searching for you.\u2019 ","He answered
 \u2018Let us go on to the neighbouring towns
 so that I may proclaim the message there also; for that is what I came out to do.\u2019 ","Moved with pity
 Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him
 and said to him
 \u2018I do choose. Be made clean!\u2019 ","saying to him
 \u2018See that you say nothing to anyone; but go
 show yourself to the priest
 and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded
 as a testimony to them.\u2019 ","When Jesus saw their faith
 he said to the paralytic
 \u2018Son
 your sins are forgiven.\u2019 ","At once Jesus perceived in his spirit that they were discussing these questions among themselves; and he said to them
 \u2018Why do you raise such questions in your hearts? ","Which is easier
 to say to the paralytic
 \u201cYour sins are forgiven\u201d
 or to say
 \u201cStand up and take your mat and walk\u201d? ","But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins\u2019\u2014he said to the paralytic\u2014","\u2018I say to you
 stand up
 take your mat and go to your home.\u2019 ","As he was walking along
 he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax booth
 and he said to him
 \u2018Follow me.\u2019 And he got up and followed him.","When Jesus heard this
 he said to them
 \u2018Those who are well have no need of a physician
 but those who are sick; I have come to call not the righteous but sinners.\u2019","Jesus said to them
 \u2018The wedding-guests cannot fast while the bridegroom is with them
 can they? As long as they have the bridegroom with them
 they cannot fast. ","The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them
 and then they will fast on that day.","\u2018No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old cloak; otherwise
 the patch pulls away from it
 the new from the old
 and a worse tear is made. ","And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; otherwise
 the wine will burst the skins
 and the wine is lost
 and so are the skins; but one puts new wine into fresh wineskins.\u2019","The Pharisees said to him
 \u2018Look
 why are they doing what is not lawful on the sabbath?\u2019 ","And he said to them
 \u2018Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need of food? ","Then he said to them
 \u2018The sabbath was made for humankind
 and not humankind for the sabbath; ","so the Son of Man is lord even of the sabbath.\u2019","And he said to the man who had the withered hand
 \u2018Come forward.\u2019 ","Then he said to them
 \u2018Is it lawful to do good or to do harm on the sabbath
 to save life or to kill?\u2019 But they were silent. ","He looked around at them with anger; he was grieved at their hardness of heart and said to the man
 \u2018Stretch out your hand.\u2019 He stretched it out
 and his hand was restored. ","And he called them to him
 and spoke to them in parables
 \u2018How can Satan cast out Satan? ","If a kingdom is divided against itself
 that kingdom cannot stand. ","And if a house is divided against itself
 that house will not be able to stand. ","And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided
 he cannot stand
 but his end has come. ","But no one can enter a strong man\u2019s house and plunder his property without first tying up the strong man; then indeed the house can be plundered.","\u2018Truly I tell you
 people will be forgiven for their sins and whatever blasphemies they utter; ","but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit can never have forgiveness
 but is guilty of an eternal sin\u2019\u2014 ","A crowd was sitting around him; and they said to him
 \u2018Your mother and your brothers and sisters are outside
 asking for you.\u2019 ","And he replied
 \u2018Who are my mother and my brothers?\u2019 ","And looking at those who sat around him
 he said
 \u2018Here are my mother and my brothers! ","Whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother.\u2019","He began to teach them many things in parables
 and in his teaching he said to them: ","\u2018Listen! A sower went out to sow.","And as he sowed
 some seed fell on the path
 and the birds came and ate it up. ","Other seed fell on rocky ground
 where it did not have much soil
 and it sprang up quickly
 since it had no depth of soil. ","And when the sun rose
 it was scorched; and since it had no root
 it withered away. ","Other seed fell among thorns
 and the thorns grew up and choked it
 and it yielded no grain. ","Other seed fell into good soil and brought forth grain
 growing up and increasing and yielding thirty and sixty and a hundredfold.\u2019 ","And he said
 \u2018Let anyone with ears to hear listen!\u2019","And he said to them
 \u2018To you has been given the secret of the kingdom of God
 but for those outside
 everything comes in parables; ","in order that \u201cthey may indeed look
 but not perceive
 and may indeed listen
 but not understand; so that they may not turn again and be forgiven.\u201d\u2019","And he said to them
 \u2018Do you not understand this parable? Then how will you understand all the parables? ","The sower sows the word.","These are the ones on the path where the word is sown: when they hear
 Satan immediately comes and takes away the word that is sown in them. ","And these are the ones sown on rocky ground: when they hear the word
 they immediately receive it with joy. ","But they have no root
 and endure only for a while; then
 when trouble or persecution arises on account of the word
 immediately they fall away. ","And others are those sown among the thorns: these are the ones who hear the word
 ","but the cares of the world
 and the lure of wealth
 and the desire for other things come in and choke the word
 and it yields nothing. ","And these are the ones sown on the good soil: they hear the word and accept it and bear fruit
 thirty and sixty and a hundredfold.\u2019","He said to them
 \u2018Is a lamp brought in to be put under the bushel basket
 or under the bed
 and not on the lampstand? ","For there is nothing hidden
 except to be disclosed; nor is anything secret
 except to come to light. ","Let anyone with ears to hear listen!\u2019","And he said to them
 \u2018Pay attention to what you hear; the measure you give will be the measure you get
 and still more will be given you. ","For to those who have
 more will be given; and from those who have nothing
 even what they have will be taken away.\u2019","He also said
 \u2018The kingdom of God is as if someone would scatter seed on the ground
 ","and would sleep and rise night and day
 and the seed would sprout and grow
 he does not know how. ","The earth produces of itself
 first the stalk
 then the head
 then the full grain in the head. ","But when the grain is ripe
 at once he goes in with his sickle
 because the harvest has come.\u2019","He also said
 \u2018With what can we compare the kingdom of God
 or what parable will we use for it? ","It is like a mustard seed
 which
 when sown upon the ground
 is the smallest of all the seeds on earth; ","yet when it is sown it grows up and becomes the greatest of all shrubs
 and puts forth large branches
 so that the birds of the air can make nests in its shade.\u2019","On that day
 when evening had come
 he said to them
 \u2018Let us go across to the other side.\u2019 ","He woke up and rebuked the wind
 and said to the sea
 \u2018Peace! Be still!\u2019 Then the wind ceased
 and there was a dead calm. ","He said to them
 \u2018Why are you afraid? Have you still no faith?\u2019 ","For he had said to him
 \u2018Come out of the man
 you unclean spirit!\u2019 ","Then Jesus asked him
 \u2018What is your name?\u2019 He replied
 \u2018My name is Legion; for we are many.\u2019 ","But Jesus refused
 and said to him
 \u2018Go home to your friends
 and tell them how much the Lord has done for you
 and what mercy he has shown you.\u2019 ","for she said
 \u2018If I but touch his clothes
 I will be made well.\u2019 ","And his disciples said to him
 \u2018You see the crowd pressing in on you; how can you say
 \u201cWho touched me?\u201d\u2019 ","He said to her
 \u2018Daughter
 your faith has made you well; go in peace
 and be healed of your disease.\u2019","But overhearing what they said
 Jesus said to the leader of the synagogue
 \u2018Do not fear
 only believe.\u2019 ","When he had entered
 he said to them
 \u2018Why do you make a commotion and weep? The child is not dead but sleeping.\u2019 ","He took her by the hand and said to her
 \u2018Talitha cum\u2019
 which means
 \u2018Little girl
 get up!\u2019 ","Then Jesus said to them
 \u2018Prophets are not without honour
 except in their home town
 and among their own kin
 and in their own house.\u2019 ","He called the twelve and began to send them out two by two
 and gave them authority over the unclean spirits. ","He said to them
 \u2018Wherever you enter a house
 stay there until you leave the place. ","If any place will not welcome you and they refuse to hear you
 as you leave
 shake off the dust that is on your feet as a testimony against them.\u2019 ","But when Herod heard of it
 he said
 \u2018John
 whom I beheaded
 has been raised.\u2019","When his daughter Herodias came in and danced
 she pleased Herod and his guests; and the king said to the girl
 \u2018Ask me for whatever you wish
 and I will give it.\u2019 ","She went out and said to her mother
 \u2018What should I ask for?\u2019 She replied
 \u2018The head of John the baptizer.\u2019 ","He said to them
 \u2018Come away to a deserted place all by yourselves and rest a while.\u2019 For many were coming and going
 and they had no leisure even to eat. ","But he answered them
 \u2018You give them something to eat.\u2019 They said to him
 \u2018Are we to go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread
 and give it to them to eat?\u2019 ","And he said to them
 \u2018How many loaves have you? Go and see.\u2019 When they had found out
 they said
 \u2018Five
 and two fish.\u2019 ","for they all saw him and were terrified. But immediately he spoke to them and said
 \u2018Take heart
 it is I; do not be afraid.\u2019 ","He said to them
 \u2018Isaiah prophesied rightly about you hypocrites
 as it is written
 \u201cThis people honours me with their lips
 but their hearts are far from me;","in vain do they worship me
 teaching human precepts as doctrines.\u201d","You abandon the commandment of God and hold to human tradition.\u2019","Then he said to them
 \u2018You have a fine way of rejecting the commandment of God in order to keep your tradition! ","For Moses said
 \u201cHonour your father and your mother\u201d; and
 \u201cWhoever speaks evil of father or mother must surely die.\u201d ","But you say that if anyone tells father or mother
 \u201cWhatever support you might have had from me is Corban\u201d (that is
 an offering to God)\u2014 ","then you no longer permit doing anything for a father or mother
 ","thus making void the word of God through your tradition that you have handed on. And you do many things like this.\u2019","Then he called the crowd again and said to them
 \u2018Listen to me
 all of you
 and understand: ","there is nothing outside a person that by going in can defile
 but the things that come out are what defile.\u2019","He said to them
 \u2018Then do you also fail to understand? Do you not see that whatever goes into a person from outside cannot defile
 ","since it enters
 not the heart but the stomach
 and goes out into the sewer?\u2019 (Thus he declared all foods clean.) ","And he said
 \u2018It is what comes out of a person that defiles. ","For it is from within
 from the human heart
 that evil intentions come: fornication
 theft
 murder
 ","adultery
 avarice
 wickedness
 deceit
 licentiousness
 envy
 slander
 pride
 folly. ","All these evil things come from within
 and they defile a person.\u2019","He said to her
 \u2018Let the children be fed first
 for it is not fair to take the children\u2019s food and throw it to the dogs.\u2019 ","Then he said to her
 \u2018For saying that
 you may go\u2014the demon has left your daughter.\u2019 ","Then looking up to heaven
 he sighed and said to him
 \u2018Ephphatha\u2019
 that is
 \u2018Be opened.\u2019 ","In those days when there was again a great crowd without anything to eat
 he called his disciples and said to them
 ","\u2018I have compassion for the crowd
 because they have been with me now for three days and have nothing to eat. ","If I send them away hungry to their homes
 they will faint on the way\u2014and some of them have come from a great distance.\u2019 ","He asked them
 \u2018How many loaves do you have?\u2019 They said
 \u2018Seven.\u2019 ","And he sighed deeply in his spirit and said
 \u2018Why does this generation ask for a sign? Truly I tell you
 no sign will be given to this generation.\u2019 ","And he cautioned them
 saying
 \u2018Watch out\u2014beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod.\u2019 ","And becoming aware of it
 Jesus said to them
 \u2018Why are you talking about having no bread? Do you still not perceive or understand? Are your hearts hardened? ","Do you have eyes
 and fail to see? Do you have ears
 and fail to hear? And do you not remember? ","When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand
 how many baskets full of broken pieces did you collect?\u2019 They said to him
 \u2018Twelve.\u2019 ","\u2018And the seven for the four thousand
 how many baskets full of broken pieces did you collect?\u2019 And they said to him
 \u2018Seven.\u2019 ","Then he said to them
 \u2018Do you not yet understand?\u2019","He took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village; and when he had put saliva on his eyes and laid his hands on him
 he asked him
 \u2018Can you see anything?\u2019 ","Then he sent him away to his home
 saying
 \u2018Do not even go into the village.\u2019","Jesus went on with his disciples to the villages of Caesarea Philippi; and on the way he asked his disciples
 \u2018Who do people say that I am?\u2019 ","He asked them
 \u2018But who do you say that I am?\u2019 Peter answered him
 \u2018You are the Messiah.\u2019 ","But turning and looking at his disciples
 he rebuked Peter and said
 \u2018Get behind me
 Satan! For you are setting your mind not on divine things but on human things.\u2019","He called the crowd with his disciples
 and said to them
 \u2018If any want to become my followers
 let them deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me. ","For those who want to save their life will lose it
 and those who lose their life for my sake
 and for the sake of the gospel
 will save it. ","For what will it profit them to gain the whole world and forfeit their life?","Indeed
 what can they give in return for their life? ","Those who are ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation
 of them the Son of Man will also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.\u2019 ","And he said to them
 \u2018Truly I tell you
 there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see that the kingdom of God has come with power.\u2019","Then Peter said to Jesus
 \u2018Rabbi
 it is good for us to be here; let us make three dwellings
 one for you
 one for Moses
 and one for Elijah.\u2019 ","He said to them
 \u2018Elijah is indeed coming first to restore all things. How then is it written about the Son of Man
 that he is to go through many sufferings and be treated with contempt? ","But I tell you that Elijah has come
 and they did to him whatever they pleased
 as it is written about him.\u2019","He asked them
 \u2018What are you arguing about with them?\u2019 ","He answered them
 \u2018You faithless generation
 how much longer must I be among you? How much longer must I put up with you? Bring him to me.\u2019 ","Jesus asked the father
 \u2018How long has this been happening to him?\u2019 And he said
 \u2018From childhood. ","Jesus said to him
 \u2018If you are able!\u2014All things can be done for the one who believes.\u2019 ","When Jesus saw that a crowd came running together
 he rebuked the unclean spirit
 saying to it
 \u2018You spirit that keep this boy from speaking and hearing
 I command you
 come out of him
 and never enter him again!\u2019 ","He said to them
 \u2018This kind can come out only through prayer.\u2019","for he was teaching his disciples
 saying to them
 \u2018The Son of Man is to be betrayed into human hands
 and they will kill him
 and three days after being killed
 he will rise again.\u2019 ","Then they came to Capernaum; and when he was in the house he asked them
 \u2018What were you arguing about on the way?\u2019 ","He sat down
 called the twelve
 and said to them
 \u2018Whoever wants to be first must be last of all and servant of all.\u2019 ","Then he took a little child and put it among them; and taking it in his arms
 he said to them
 ","But Jesus said
 \u2018Do not stop him; for no one who does a deed of power in my name will be able soon afterwards to speak evil of me. ","Whoever is not against us is for us.","For truly I tell you
 whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you bear the name of Christ will by no means lose the reward.","\u2018If any of you put a stumbling-block before one of these little ones who believe in me
 it would be better for you if a great millstone were hung around your neck and you were thrown into the sea. ","If your hand causes you to stumble
 cut it off; it is better for you to enter life maimed than to have two hands and to go to hell
 to the unquenchable fire. ","And if your foot causes you to stumble
 cut it off; it is better for you to enter life lame than to have two feet and to be thrown into hell. ","And if your eye causes you to stumble
 tear it out; it is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and to be thrown into hell
 ","where their worm never dies
 and the fire is never quenched.","\u2018For everyone will be salted with fire.","Salt is good; but if salt has lost its saltiness
 how can you season it? Have salt in yourselves
 and be at peace with one another.\u2019","He answered them
 \u2018What did Moses command you?\u2019 ","But Jesus said to them
 \u2018Because of your hardness of heart he wrote this commandment for you. ","But from the beginning of creation
 \u201cGod made them male and female.\u201d ","\u201cFor this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife
 ","and the two shall become one flesh.\u201d So they are no longer two
 but one flesh. ","Therefore what God has joined together
 let no one separate.\u2019","He said to them
 \u2018Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her; ","and if she divorces her husband and marries another
 she commits adultery.\u2019","But when Jesus saw this
 he was indignant and said to them
 \u2018Let the little children come to me; do not stop them; for it is to such as these that the kingdom of God belongs. ","Truly I tell you
 whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will never enter it.\u2019 ","Jesus said to him
 \u2018Why do you call me good? No one is good but God alone. ","You know the commandments: \u201cYou shall not murder; You shall not commit adultery; You shall not steal; You shall not bear false witness; You shall not defraud; Honour your father and mother.\u201d\u2019","He said to him
 \u2018Teacher
 I have kept all these since my youth.\u2019 ","Jesus
 looking at him
 loved him and said
 \u2018You lack one thing; go
 sell what you own
 and give the money to the poor
 and you will have treasure in heaven; then come
 follow me.\u2019 ","Then Jesus looked around and said to his disciples
 \u2018How hard it will be for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God!\u2019 ","And the disciples were perplexed at these words. But Jesus said to them again
 \u2018Children
 how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God! ","It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.\u2019","They were greatly astounded and said to one another
 \u2018Then who can be saved?\u2019 ","Jesus looked at them and said
 \u2018For mortals it is impossible
 but not for God; for God all things are possible.\u2019","Jesus said
 \u2018Truly I tell you
 there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields
 for my sake and for the sake of the good news
 ","who will not receive a hundredfold now in this age\u2014houses
 brothers and sisters
 mothers and children
 and fields
 with persecutions\u2014and in the age to come eternal life. ","But many who are first will be last
 and the last will be first.\u2019","saying
 \u2018See
 we are going up to Jerusalem
 and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the scribes
 and they will condemn him to death; then they will hand him over to the Gentiles; ","they will mock him
 and spit upon him
 and flog him
 and kill him; and after three days he will rise again.\u2019","James and John
 the sons of Zebedee
 came forward to him and said to him
 \u2018Teacher
 we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you.\u2019 ","And he said to them
 \u2018What is it you want me to do for you?\u2019 ","But Jesus said to them
 \u2018You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink
 or be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?\u2019 ","They replied
 \u2018We are able.\u2019 Then Jesus said to them
 \u2018The cup that I drink you will drink; and with the baptism with which I am baptized
 you will be baptized; ","but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant
 but it is for those for whom it has been prepared.\u2019","So Jesus called them and said to them
 \u2018You know that among the Gentiles those whom they recognize as their rulers lord it over them
 and their great ones are tyrants over them. ","But it is not so among you; but whoever wishes to become great among you must be your servant
 ","and whoever wishes to be first among you must be slave of all.","For the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve
 and to give his life a ransom for many.\u2019","Jesus stood still and said
 \u2018Call him here.\u2019 And they called the blind man
 saying to him
 \u2018Take heart; get up
 he is calling you.\u2019 ","Then Jesus said to him
 \u2018What do you want me to do for you?\u2019 The blind man said to him
 \u2018My teacher
 let me see again.\u2019 ","Jesus said to him
 \u2018Go; your faith has made you well.\u2019 Immediately he regained his sight and followed him on the way.","and said to them
 \u2018Go into the village ahead of you
 and immediately as you enter it
 you will find tied there a colt that has never been ridden; untie it and bring it. ","If anyone says to you
 \u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d just say this
 \u201cThe Lord needs it and will send it back here immediately.\u201d\u2019 ","He said to it
 \u2018May no one ever eat fruit from you again.\u2019 And his disciples heard it.","He was teaching and saying
 \u2018Is it not written
 \u201cMy house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations\u201d? But you have made it a den of robbers.\u2019","Jesus answered them
 \u2018Have faith in God. ","Truly I tell you
 if you say to this mountain
 \u201cBe taken up and thrown into the sea\u201d
 and if you do not doubt in your heart
 but believe that what you say will come to pass
 it will be done for you. ","So I tell you
 whatever you ask for in prayer
 believe that you have received it
 and it will be yours.","\u2018Whenever you stand praying
 forgive
 if you have anything against anyone; so that your Father in heaven may also forgive you your trespasses.\u2019","Jesus said to them
 \u2018I will ask you one question; answer me
 and I will tell you by what authority I do these things. ","Did the baptism of John come from heaven
 or was it of human origin? Answer me.\u2019 ","So they answered Jesus
 \u2018We do not know.\u2019 And Jesus said to them
 \u2018Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.\u2019","Then he began to speak to them in parables. \u2018A man planted a vineyard
 put a fence around it
 dug a pit for the wine press
 and built a watch-tower; then he leased it to tenants and went to another country. ","When the season came
 he sent a slave to the tenants to collect from them his share of the produce of the vineyard. ","But they seized him
 and beat him
 and sent him away empty-handed. ","And again he sent another slave to them; this one they beat over the head and insulted.","Then he sent another
 and that one they killed. And so it was with many others; some they beat
 and others they killed. ","He had still one other
 a beloved son. Finally he sent him to them
 saying
 \u201cThey will respect my son.\u201d ","But those tenants said to one another
 \u201cThis is the heir; come
 let us kill him
 and the inheritance will be ours.\u201d ","So they seized him
 killed him
 and threw him out of the vineyard. ","What then will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the tenants and give the vineyard to others.","Have you not read this scripture: \u201cThe stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone;","this was the Lord\u2019s doing
 and it is amazing in our eyes\u201d?\u2019","Then they sent to him some Pharisees and some Herodians to trap him in what he said.","Should we pay them
 or should we not?\u2019 But knowing their hypocrisy
 he said to them
 \u2018Why are you putting me to the test? Bring me a denarius and let me see it.\u2019 ","And they brought one. Then he said to them
 \u2018Whose head is this
 and whose title?\u2019 They answered
 \u2018The emperor\u2019s.\u2019 ","Jesus said to them
 \u2018Give to the emperor the things that are the emperor\u2019s
 and to God the things that are God\u2019s.\u2019 And they were utterly amazed at him.","Jesus said to them
 \u2018Is not this the reason you are wrong
 that you know neither the scriptures nor the power of God? ","For when they rise from the dead
 they neither marry nor are given in marriage
 but are like angels in heaven. ","And as for the dead being raised
 have you not read in the book of Moses
 in the story about the bush
 how God said to him
 \u201cI am the God of Abraham
 the God of Isaac
 and the God of Jacob\u201d? ","He is God not of the dead
 but of the living; you are quite wrong.\u2019","One of the scribes came near and heard them disputing with one another
 and seeing that he answered them well
 he asked him
 \u2018Which commandment is the first of all?\u2019 ","Jesus answered
 \u2018The first is
 \u201cHear
 O Israel: the Lord our God
 the Lord is one; ","you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart
 and with all your soul
 and with all your mind
 and with all your strength.\u201d ","The second is this
 \u201cYou shall love your neighbour as yourself.\u201d There is no other commandment greater than these.\u2019 ","When Jesus saw that he answered wisely
 he said to him
 \u2018You are not far from the kingdom of God.\u2019 After that no one dared to ask him any question.","While Jesus was teaching in the temple
 he said
 \u2018How can the scribes say that the Messiah is the son of David? ","David himself
 by the Holy Spirit
 declared
 \u201cThe Lord said to my Lord
 \u2018Sit at my right hand
 until I put your enemies under your feet.\u2019\u201d","David himself calls him Lord; so how can he be his son?\u2019 And the large crowd was listening to him with delight.","As he taught
 he said
 \u2018Beware of the scribes
 who like to walk around in long robes
 and to be greeted with respect in the market-places
 ","and to have the best seats in the synagogues and places of honour at banquets!","They devour widows\u2019 houses and for the sake of appearance say long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation.\u2019","Then he called his disciples and said to them
 \u2018Truly I tell you
 this poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the treasury. ","For all of them have contributed out of their abundance; but she out of her poverty has put in everything she had
 all she had to live on.\u2019","As he came out of the temple
 one of his disciples said to him
 \u2018Look
 Teacher
 what large stones and what large buildings!\u2019 ","Then Jesus asked him
 \u2018Do you see these great buildings? Not one stone will be left here upon another; all will be thrown down.\u2019","Then Jesus began to say to them
 \u2018Beware that no one leads you astray. ","Many will come in my name and say
 \u201cI am he!\u201d and they will lead many astray. ","When you hear of wars and rumours of wars
 do not be alarmed; this must take place
 but the end is still to come. ","For nation will rise against nation
 and kingdom against kingdom; there will be earthquakes in various places; there will be famines. This is but the beginning of the birth pangs.","\u2018As for yourselves
 beware; for they will hand you over to councils; and you will be beaten in synagogues; and you will stand before governors and kings because of me
 as a testimony to them. ","And the good news must first be proclaimed to all nations.","When they bring you to trial and hand you over
 do not worry beforehand about what you are to say; but say whatever is given you at that time
 for it is not you who speak
 but the Holy Spirit. ","Brother will betray brother to death
 and a father his child
 and children will rise against parents and have them put to death; ","and you will be hated by all because of my name. But the one who endures to the end will be saved.","\u2018But when you see the desolating sacrilege set up where it ought not to be (let the reader understand)
 then those in Judea must flee to the mountains; ","someone on the housetop must not go down or enter the house to take anything away;","someone in the field must not turn back to get a coat.","Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing infants in those days!","Pray that it may not be in winter.","For in those days there will be suffering
 such as has not been from the beginning of the creation that God created until now
 no
 and never will be. ","And if the Lord had not cut short those days
 no one would be saved; but for the sake of the elect
 whom he chose
 he has cut short those days. ","And if anyone says to you at that time
 \u201cLook! Here is the Messiah!\u201d or \u201cLook! There he is!\u201d\u2014do not believe it. ","False messiahs and false prophets will appear and produce signs and omens
 to lead astray
 if possible
 the elect. ","But be alert; I have already told you everything.","\u2018But in those days
 after that suffering
 the sun will be darkened
 and the moon will not give its light
","and the stars will be falling from heaven
 and the powers in the heavens will be shaken.","Then they will see \u201cthe Son of Man coming in clouds\u201d with great power and glory.","Then he will send out the angels
 and gather his elect from the four winds
 from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven.","\u2018From the fig tree learn its lesson: as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts forth its leaves
 you know that summer is near. ","So also
 when you see these things taking place
 you know that he is near
 at the very gates. ","Truly I tell you
 this generation will not pass away until all these things have taken place. ","Heaven and earth will pass away
 but my words will not pass away.","\u2018But about that day or hour no one knows
 neither the angels in heaven
 nor the Son
 but only the Father. ","Beware
 keep alert; for you do not know when the time will come. ","It is like a man going on a journey
 when he leaves home and puts his slaves in charge
 each with his work
 and commands the doorkeeper to be on the watch. ","Therefore
 keep awake\u2014for you do not know when the master of the house will come
 in the evening
 or at midnight
 or at cockcrow
 or at dawn
 ","or else he may find you asleep when he comes suddenly.","And what I say to you I say to all: Keep awake.\u2019","But some were there who said to one another in anger
 \u2018Why was the ointment wasted in this way? ","But Jesus said
 \u2018Let her alone; why do you trouble her? She has performed a good service for me. ","For you always have the poor with you
 and you can show kindness to them whenever you wish; but you will not always have me. ","She has done what she could; she has anointed my body beforehand for its burial.","Truly I tell you
 wherever the good news is proclaimed in the whole world
 what she has done will be told in remembrance of her.\u2019","So he sent two of his disciples
 saying to them
 \u2018Go into the city
 and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you; follow him
 ","and wherever he enters
 say to the owner of the house
 \u201cThe Teacher asks
 Where is my guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?\u201d ","He will show you a large room upstairs
 furnished and ready. Make preparations for us there.\u2019 ","And when they had taken their places and were eating
 Jesus said
 \u2018Truly I tell you
 one of you will betray me
 one who is eating with me.\u2019 ","He said to them
 \u2018It is one of the twelve
 one who is dipping bread into the bowl with me. ","For the Son of Man goes as it is written of him
 but woe to that one by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that one not to have been born.\u2019","While they were eating
 he took a loaf of bread
 and after blessing it he broke it
 gave it to them
 and said
 \u2018Take; this is my body.\u2019 ","He said to them
 \u2018This is my blood of the covenant
 which is poured out for many. ","Truly I tell you
 I will never again drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.\u2019","And Jesus said to them
 \u2018You will all become deserters; for it is written
 \u201cI will strike the shepherd
 and the sheep will be scattered.\u201d","But after I am raised up
 I will go before you to Galilee.\u2019 ","Jesus said to him
 \u2018Truly I tell you
 this day
 this very night
 before the cock crows twice
 you will deny me three times.\u2019 ","They went to a place called Gethsemane; and he said to his disciples
 \u2018Sit here while I pray.\u2019 ","And he said to them
 \u2018I am deeply grieved
 even to death; remain here
 and keep awake.\u2019 ","He said
 \u2018Abba
 Father
 for you all things are possible; remove this cup from me; yet
 not what I want
 but what you want.\u2019 ","He came and found them sleeping; and he said to Peter
 \u2018Simon
 are you asleep? Could you not keep awake one hour? ","Keep awake and pray that you may not come into the time of trial; the spirit indeed is willing
 but the flesh is weak.\u2019 ","He came a third time and said to them
 \u2018Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? Enough! The hour has come; the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. ","Get up
 let us be going. See
 my betrayer is at hand.\u2019","Then Jesus said to them
 \u2018Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me as though I were a bandit? ","Day after day I was with you in the temple teaching
 and you did not arrest me. But let the scriptures be fulfilled.\u2019 ","Jesus said
 \u2018I am; and \u201cyou will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Power\u201d
 and \u201ccoming with the clouds of heaven.\u201d\u2019","Some began to spit on him
 to blindfold him
 and to strike him
 saying to him
 \u2018Prophesy!\u2019 The guards also took him over and beat him.","At that moment the cock crowed for the second time. Then Peter remembered that Jesus had said to him
 \u2018Before the cock crows twice
 you will deny me three times.\u2019 And he broke down and wept.","Pilate asked him
 \u2018Are you the King of the Jews?\u2019 He answered him
 \u2018You say so.\u2019 ","Then he answered them
 \u2018Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?\u2019 ","At three o\u2019clock Jesus cried out with a loud voice
 \u2018Eloi

 lema sabachthani?\u2019 which means
 \u2018My God

 who stood facing him
 saw that in this way he breathed his last
 he said
 \u2018Truly this man was God\u2019s Son!\u2019","Then Pilate wondered if he were already dead; and summoning the centurion
 he asked him whether he had been dead for some time. ","They had been saying to one another
 \u2018Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb?\u2019 ","But he said to them
 \u2018Do not be alarmed; you are looking for Jesus of Nazareth

 there is the place they laid him. ","And he said to them
 \u2018Go into all the world and proclaim the good news to the whole creation. ","The one who believes and is baptized will be saved; but the one who does not believe will be condemned.","And these signs will accompany those who believe: by using my name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues;","they will pick up snakes in their hands

 it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick

 \u2018we want you to grant us whatever we ask.\u2019","\u2018What do you want me to do for you?\u2019 asked Jesus.","\u2018You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re asking for!\u2019 Jesus replied. \u2018Can you drink the cup I\u2019m going to drink? Can you receive the baptism I\u2019m going to receive?\u2019","\u2018Yes
\u2019 they said
 \u2018we can.\u2019 \u2018Well
\u2019 said Jesus
 \u2018you will drink the cup I drink; you will receive the baptism I receive.","But sitting at my right hand or my left\u00a0\u2013 that\u2019s not up to me. It\u2019s been assigned already.\u2019","Jesus called them to him. \u2018You know how it is in the pagan nations
\u2019 he said. \u2018Think how their so-called rulers act. They lord it over their subjects. The high and mighty ones boss the rest around.","But that\u2019s not how it\u2019s going to be with you. Anyone who wants to be great among you must become your servant. \u2018You know how it is in the pagan nations
\u2019 he said. \u2018Think how their so-called rulers act. They lord it over their subjects. The high and mighty ones boss the rest around. ","Anyone who wants to be first must be everyone\u2019s slave.","Don\u2019t you see? The son of man didn\u2019t come to be waited on. He came to be the servant
 to give his life \u201cas a ransom for many\u201d.\u2019","Jesus came to a stop. \u2018Call him
\u2019 he said. So they called the blind man. \u2018Cheer up
\u2019 they said
 \u2018and get up. He\u2019s calling you.\u2019","\u2018What do you want me to do for you?\u2019 he asked. \u2018Teacher
\u2019 the blind man said
 \u2018let me see again.\u2019","\u2018Off you go
\u2019 said Jesus. \u2018Your faith has saved you.\u2019 And immediately he saw again
 and he followed him on the way.","\u2018Go to the village over there
\u2019 he said to them
 \u2018and as soon as you enter it you will find a colt tied up\u00a0\u2013 one that nobody has ever ridden before. Untie it and bring it here. ","And if anyone says to you
 \u201cWhy are you doing that?\u201d then say
 \u201cThe master needs it
 and he will return it at once.\u201d\u202f\u2019","He addressed the tree directly. \u2018May no one ever eat fruit from you again
\u2019 he said. And his disciples heard.","He began to teach: \u2018Isn\u2019t this what\u2019s written
\u2019 he said
 \u2018My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the world to share? But you\u2019ve made it a brigands\u2019 den!\u2019","\u2018Have faith in God
\u2019 replied Jesus. ","\u2018I\u2019m telling you the truth: if anyone says to this mountain
 \u201cBe off with you\u00a0\u2013 get yourself thrown into the sea\u201d
 if they have no doubt in their heart
 but believe that what they say will happen
 it will be done for them. ","That\u2019s why I\u2019m telling you
 everything that you request in prayer
 everything you ask God for
 believe that you receive it
 and it will happen for you.","\u2018And when you are standing there praying
 if you have something against someone else
 forgive them\u00a0\u2013 so that your father in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.\u2019","\u2018I have one question for you
 too
\u2019 replied Jesus
 \u2018and if you tell me the answer I shall tell you by what right I do these things. ","Was the baptism of John from heaven
 or was it a human invention? What\u2019s your answer?\u2019","\u2018We don\u2019t know
\u2019 they said to Jesus. \u2018Nor will I tell you\u2019
 replied Jesus
 \u2018by what right I do these things.\u2019","Jesus began to speak to them with parables. \u2018Once upon a time
\u2019 he began
 \u2018there was a man who planted a vineyard. He built a fence around it
 dug out a wine-press
 built a watchtower
 and then let it out to tenant farmers. He himself went abroad. ","When the time came he sent a slave to the farmers to collect from them his portion of the vineyard\u2019s produce.","They seized him
 beat him and sent him away empty-handed.","\u2018So again he sent another slave to them. This one they beat about the head
 and treated shamefully. ","He sent another
 and they killed him. He sent several more; they beat some and killed others.","\u2018He had one more to send: his beloved son. He sent him to them last of all
 thinking \u201cThey will respect my son\u201d.","\u2018But the tenant farmers said to themselves
 \u201cThis is the heir! Come on \u2013 let\u2019s kill him
 and we\u2019ll get the inheritance!\u201d","So they seized him and killed him
 and threw him out of the vineyard.","\u2018So what will the vineyard owner do? He will come and destroy those tenants
 and give the vineyard to others. ","Or haven\u2019t you read the scripture which says
 There is the stone the builders refused; now it\u2019s in place at the top of the corner.","This happened the way the Lord planned it; we were astonished to see it.\u2019","They sent some Pharisees to Jesus
 and some Herodians
 to try to trick him into saying the wrong thing.","He knew the game they were playing. \u2018Why are you trying to trap me?\u2019 he said. \u2018Bring me a tribute-coin; let me look at it.\u2019","They brought one to him. \u2018This image
\u2019 he asked
 \u2018whose is it? And whose is this superscription?\u2019 \u2018Caesar\u2019s
\u2019 they replied.","\u2018Well then
\u2019 said Jesus
 \u2018give Caesar back what belongs to Caesar\u00a0\u2013 and give God back what belongs to God!\u2019 They were astonished at him.","\u2018Where you\u2019re going wrong\u2019
 replied Jesus
 \u2018is that you don\u2019t know the scriptures
 or God\u2019s power. ","When people rise from the dead
 they don\u2019t marry
 nor do people give them in marriage. They are like angels in heaven.","\u2018However
 to show that the dead are indeed to be raised
 surely you\u2019ve read in the book of Moses
 in the passage about the bush
 what God says to Moses? \u201cI am Abraham\u2019s God
 Isaac\u2019s God and Jacob\u2019s God\u201d? ","He isn\u2019t the God of the dead
 but of the living. You are completely mistaken.\u2019","One of the legal experts came up
 and overheard the discussion. Realizing that Jesus had given a splendid answer
 he put a question of his own.","\u2018The first one\u2019
 replied Jesus
 \u2018is this: \u201cListen
 Israel: the Lord your God
 the Lord is one; ","and you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart
 and with all your soul
 and with all your understanding
 and with all your strength.\u201d ","And this is the second one: \u201cYou shall love your neighbour as yourself.\u201d No other commandment is greater than these ones.\u2019","Jesus saw that his answer came out of deep understanding. \u2018You are not far from God\u2019s kingdom
\u2019 he said to him. After that
 nobody dared put any more questions to him.","By way of response to it all
 Jesus began to teach in the Temple. \u2018Why do the experts say\u2019
 he asked
 \u2018that the Messiah is the son of David? ","David himself
 inspired by the holy spirit
 said: The Lord said to my Lord: sit at my right hand
 until I place your enemies right underneath your feet.","\u2018David himself calls him \u201cLord\u201d; how then can he be his son?\u2019 The whole crowd listened to him with delight.","During his teaching
 he said
 \u2018Beware of the lawyers! They like to walk about in long robes
 and to be greeted in the market-places. ","They take the chief seats in the synagogue
 and the best places at dinner parties. ","They devour the property of widows
 and make long prayers without meaning them. They will receive all the more condemnation.\u2019","Jesus called his disciples. \u2018I\u2019m telling you the truth
\u2019 he said. \u2018This poor widow just put more into the treasury than everybody else.","You see
 all the others were contributing out of their wealth; but she put in everything she had
 out of her poverty. It was her whole livelihood.\u2019","As they were going out of the Temple
 one of Jesus\u2019 disciples said to him
 \u2018Teacher! Look at these huge stones
 and these huge buildings!\u2019","\u2018You see these enormous buildings?\u2019 said Jesus. \u2018There will not be one single stone left on top of another. They will all be torn down.\u2019","\u2018Take care that nobody deceives you
\u2019 Jesus began to say to them. ","\u2018Plenty of people will come in my name
 saying \u201cI\u2019m the one!\u201d
 and they will lead plenty astray. ","But whenever you hear about wars
 and rumours about wars
 don\u2019t be disturbed. These things have to happen
 but it doesn\u2019t mean the end is here. ","One nation will rise up against another; one kingdom will rise up against another. There will be earthquakes from place to place
 and famines too. These are the first pains of childbirth.","\u2018But watch out for yourselves. They will hand you over to courts
 they will beat you in synagogues; you will stand before rulers and kings because of me
 as a witness against them. ","And the message of the kingdom must first be announced to all the nations.","And when they put you on trial and hand you over
 don\u2019t work out beforehand what you are going to say
 but say whatever is given you at that moment. It won\u2019t be you speaking
 you see
 but the holy spirit.","\u2018One brother will hand over another to death. Fathers will hand over children. Children will rebel against parents and have them put to death.","And you will be hated by everyone because of my name. But the one who is patient through to the end\u00a0\u2013 that one will be saved.\u2019","\u2018However
\u2019 Jesus continued
 \u2018when you see \u201cthe desolating abomination\u201d set up where it ought not to be\u2019 (let the reader understand) \u2018then those who are in Judaea should run away to the mountains. ","If you\u2019re on the housetop
 don\u2019t go down
 and don\u2019t go in to get anything from the house. ","If you\u2019re out in the countryside
 don\u2019t turn back again to pick up your cloak.","\u2018It will be a terrible time for pregnant and nursing mothers.","Pray that it won\u2019t happen in winter.","Yes
 those days will bring trouble like nothing that\u2019s ever happened from the beginning of creation
 which God created
 until now
 or ever will again. ","In fact
 if the Lord had not shortened the days
 no one would be rescued. But for the sake of his chosen ones
 those whom he appointed
 he shortened the days.","\u2018So at that time
 if someone says to you
 \u201cLook\u00a0\u2013 here is the Messiah!\u201d or
 \u201cLook\u00a0\u2013 there he is!\u201d
 don\u2019t believe them; ","because false messiahs and false prophets will arise
 and will perform signs and portents to lead astray even God\u2019s chosen ones
 if that were possible. ","But you must be on your guard. I\u2019ve told you everything ahead of time.","\u2018But in those days
 after that suffering
 The sun will be dark as night and the moon will not give its light;","the stars will fall from heaven and the powers in heaven will shake.","\u2018Then they will see \u201cthe son of man coming on clouds with great power and glory\u201d.","And then he will dispatch his messengers
 and will gather in his chosen ones from the four winds
 from the ends of earth to the ends of heaven.\u2019","\u2018Learn this lesson from the fig tree. When its branch becomes soft and sprouts leaves
 you know that summer is near. ","In the same way
 when you see these things happen
 you should know that it is near
 right at the gates. ","I\u2019m telling you the truth: this generation won\u2019t disappear until all of this has happened.","Heaven and earth will disappear
 but my words won\u2019t disappear.","\u2018No one knows
 though
 the day or the hour. The angels in heaven don\u2019t know it; nor does the son; only the father.","\u2018Keep watch
 stay awake. You don\u2019t know when the moment will arrive. ","It\u2019s like a man who goes away from home: he leaves his house
 giving each of his slaves authority for their own tasks; and he commands the doorkeeper to keep watch. ","Keep watch
 then
 because you don\u2019t know when the master of the house is going to come. It might be at evening
 or at midnight
 or at cockcrow
 or in the morning! ","You don\u2019t want him to come suddenly and find you asleep.","What I am telling you
 I am telling everyone: keep watch!\u2019","Some of the people there grumbled to one another. \u2018What\u2019s the point of wasting the ointment?\u2019 they asked.","\u2018Leave her alone
\u2019 said Jesus. \u2018Why make trouble for her? She has done a wonderful thing for me. ","You have the poor with you always; you can help them whenever you want to. But you won\u2019t always have me.","\u2018She has played her part. She has anointed my body for its burial
 ahead of time. ","I\u2019m telling you the truth: wherever the message is announced in all the world
 the story of what she has just done will be told. That will be her memorial.\u2019","He sent off two of his disciples
 with these instructions. \u2018Go into the city
 and you will be met by a man carrying a water-pot. Follow him.","When he goes indoors
 say to the master of the house
 \u201cThe teacher says
 where is the guest room for me
 where I can eat the Passover with my disciples?\u201d ","He will show you a large upstairs room
 set out and ready. Make preparations for us there.\u2019","As they were reclining at table and eating
 Jesus said
 \u2018I\u2019m telling you the truth: one of you is going to betray me\u00a0\u2013 one of you that\u2019s eating with me.\u2019","\u2018It\u2019s one of the Twelve
\u2019 said Jesus
 \u2018one who has dipped his bread in the dish with me. ","Yes: the son of man is completing his journey
 as scripture said he would; but it\u2019s bad news for the man who betrays him! It would have been better for that man never to have been born.\u2019","While they were eating
 he took bread
 blessed it
 broke it
 and gave it to them. \u2018Take it
\u2019 he said. \u2018This is my body.\u2019","\u2018This is my blood of the covenant
\u2019 he said
 \u2018which is poured out for many. ","I\u2019m telling you the truth: I won\u2019t ever drink from the fruit of the vine again
 until that day\u00a0\u2013 the day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.\u2019","\u2018You\u2019re all going to desert me
\u2019 said Jesus
 \u2018because it\u2019s written
 I shall attack the shepherd\nand then the sheep will scatter.","\u2018But after I am raised up
 I will go ahead of you to Galilee.\u2019","\u2018I\u2019m telling you the truth
\u2019 Jesus replied. \u2018Today\u00a0\u2013 this very night
 before the cock has crowed twice\u00a0\u2013 you will renounce me three times.\u2019","They came to a place called Gethsemane. \u2018Stay here\u2019
 said Jesus to the disciples
 \u2018while I pray.\u2019","\u2018\u202f\u201cMy soul is disturbed within me\u201d
 he said
 \u2018right to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch.\u2019","\u2018Abba
 father
\u2019 he said
 \u2018all things are possible for you! Take this cup away from me! But\u00a0\u2013 not what I want
 but what you want.\u2019","He returned and found them sleeping. \u2018Are you asleep
 Simon?\u2019 he said to Peter. \u2018Couldn\u2019t you keep watch for a single hour? ","Watch and pray
 so that you won\u2019t come into the time of trouble. The spirit is eager
 but the body is weak.\u2019","But the third time he came
 he said to them
 \u2018All right\u00a0\u2013 sleep as much as you like now. Have a good rest. The job is done
 the time has come\u00a0\u2013 and look! The son of man is betrayed into the clutches of sinners. ","Get up
 let\u2019s be on our way. Here comes the man who\u2019s going to betray me.\u2019","Then Jesus spoke to them. \u2018Anyone would think\u2019
 he said

 under your noses

 and coming with the clouds of heaven\u201d.\u2019","Some of them began to spit at him. They blindfolded him and hit him
 and said
 \u2018Prophesy!\u2019 And the servants took charge of him and beat him.","And immediately the cock crowed for the second time. Then Peter remembered the words that Jesus had said to him: \u2018Before the cock crows twice

 He saw Levi

 \u201cFollow Me.\u201d And he arose and followed Him.","Now when Jesus heard it
 He said to them
 \u201cThe healthy have no need of the Physician

 \u201cCan the children of the marriage chamber fast while the Bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the Bridegroom with them
 they cannot fast.","\u201cBut the days will come when the Bridegroom shall be taken from them. And then shall they fast
 in those days.","\u201cAlso no one sows a piece of new cloth in an old garment. For the new piece that filled it up will take away somewhat from the old. And the breach is worse.","\u201cLikewise
 no one puts new wine into old vessels. For the new wine will break the vessels

 there went out a sower to sow.","\u201cAnd it came to pass as he sowed
 that some fell by the wayside. And the birds of the heaven came and devoured it up.","\u201cAnd some fell on stony ground
 where it had not much earth. And it quickly sprang up

 it was burnt up. And because it had not root
 it withered away.","\u201cAnd some fell among the thorns. And the thorns grew up and choked it
 so that it gave no fruit.","\u201cSome again fell in good ground

 all things are done in parables
","\u201cSo that those seeing may see
 and not discern. And those hearing may hear
 and not understand; lest at any time they should turn and their sins should be forgiven them.\u201d","Again He said to them
 \u201cDo you not perceive this parable? How then shall you understand all other parables?","\u201cThe sower sows the word.","\u201cAnd these are those who receive the seed by the wayside

 those who receive the seed in stony ground are those who (when they have heard the word) immediately receive it with gladness.","\u201cYet have they no root in themselves and endure but a time. For when trouble and persecution arise for the word
 they fall away immediately.","\u201cAlso those who receive the seed among the thorns
 are those who hear the word
","\u201cbut the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches and the lusts of other things enter in and choke the word. And it is unfruitful.","\u201cBut those who have received seed in good ground
 are those who hear the word and receive it and bring forth fruit - one corn thirty
 another sixty
 and some a hundred.\u201d","Also He said to them
 \u201cDoes the candle come in to be put under a bushel
 or under the bed
 and not to be put in a candlestick?","\u201cFor there is nothing hidden that shall not be opened. Nor is there a secret that shall not come to light.","\u201cIf anyone has ears to hear
 let him hear.\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cPay attention to what you hear. With whatever measure you use
 it shall be measured to you. And to you who hear shall more be given.","\u201cFor to him who has shall it be given. And from him that has not shall be taken away even that he has.\u201d","Also He said
 \u201cSo is the Kingdom of God: as if a man should cast seed in the ground","\u201cand should sleep and rise up night and day. And the seed should spring and grow up
 he not knowing how.","\u201cFor the earth brings forth fruit from itself; first the blade
 then the ears; after that
 full corn in the ears.","\u201cAnd as soon as the fruit shows itself
 he puts in the sickle to it. Because the harvest has come.\u201d","He said moreover
 \u201cTo what shall we liken the Kingdom of God? Or
 with what shall we compare it?","\u201cIt is like a grain of mustard seed; which
 when it is sown in the earth
 is the least of all seeds on the earth.","\u201cBut after it is sown
 it grows up and is greatest of all herbs and bears great branches. So that the birds of the heaven may build under the shadow of it.\u201d","Now the same day
 when evening had come
 He said to them
 \u201cLet us pass over to the other side.\u201d","And He arose and rebuked the wind and said to the sea
 \u201cPeace
 and be still!\u201d So
 the wind ceased. And there was a great calm.","Then He said to them
 \u201cWhy are you so fearful? How is it that you have no faith?\u201d","(For He said to him
 \u201cCome out of the man
 you unclean spirit.\u201d)","And He asked him
 \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d And he answered
 saying
 \u201cMy name is Legion. For we are many.\u201d","But Jesus would not allow it
 and said to him
 \u201cGo home to your friends and show them what great things the Lord has done for you; and how He has had compassion on you.\u201d","For she said
 \u201cIf I may but touch His clothes
 I shall be whole.\u201d","And His disciples said to Him
 \u201cYou Yourself see the crowd
 and say
 \u2018Who touched Me?\u2019\u201d","And He said to her
 \u201cDaughter
 your faith has made you whole. Go in peace and be whole of your plague.\u201d","As soon as Jesus heard that word spoken
 He said to the ruler of the synagogue
 \u201cDo not be afraid. Only believe.\u201d","And He went in
 and said to them
 \u201cWhy do you make this trouble
 and weep? The child is not dead
 but sleeps.\u201d","And He took the child by the hand
 and said to her
 \u201cTalitha cumi
\u201d which is by interpretation
 \u201cMaiden
 I say to you
 arise.\u201d","And Jesus said to them
 \u201cA Prophet is not without honor
 except in his own country and among his own kindred and in his own house.\u201d","And He called to Him the twelve and began to send them forth two and two and gave them power over unclean spirits.","And He said to them
 \u201cWherever you shall enter into a house
 stay there till you depart that place.","\u201cAnd whoever shall neither receive you nor hear you
 shake off the dust that is under your feet when you depart from there
 for a witness to them. Truly I say to you
 it shall be easier for Sodom or Gomorrah at the Day of Judgment than for that city.\u201d","So when Herod heard it
 he said
 \u201cIt is John
 whom I beheaded. He is risen from the dead.\u201d","And the daughter of that same Herodias came in and danced
 and pleased Herod
 and those who sat at table together. And the King said to the maid
 \u201cAsk of me what you will and I will give it you.\u201d","So she went forth and said to her mother
 \u201cWhat shall I ask?\u201d And she said
 \u201cJohn Baptist\u2019s head.\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cCome away into the wilderness
 and rest a while.\u201d For there were many comers and goers
 that they had not had a chance to eat.","But He answered
 and said to them
 \u201cYou give them something to eat.\u201d And they said to Him
 \u201cShall we go and buy two hundred pennies worth of bread and give them that to eat?\u201d","Then He said to them
 \u201cHow many loaves do you have? Go and look.\u201d And when they had found out
 they said
 \u201cFive
 and two fishes.\u201d","For they all saw Him and were very afraid. But He talked with them and said to them
 \u201cBe of good comfort! It is I! Do not be afraid!\u201d","Then He answered and said to them
 \u201cSurely Isaiah has prophesied well of you
 hypocrites. As it is written
 \u2018This people honors Me with lips
 but their heart is far away from Me.","\u2018But they worship Me in vain
 teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.\u2019","For you lay the Commandments of God aside
 and observe the tradition of men
 such as the washing of pots
 and of cups. And there are many other such things that you do.\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cYou reject the commandment of God
 that you may observe your own tradition.","\u201cFor Moses said
 \u2018Honor your father and your Mother. And whoever shall speak evil of father or mother
 let him die the death.\u2019","\u201cBut you say
 \u2018If a man says to father or mother
 \u2018Corban\u2019; that is
 \u2018By the gift that is offered by me
 you may have profit
 and he shall be free.\u2019","\u201cSo you don\u2019t require him to do anything for his father or his mother.","\u201cMaking the word of God of no authority
 by your tradition which you have ordained. And you do many such things.\u201d","Then He called the whole multitude to Him
 and said to them
 \u201cHear me
 all of you
 and understand!","\u201cThere is nothing outside of a man that can defile him when it enters into him. But the things which proceed out of him are those which defile the man.","And He said to them
 \u201cWhat? Are you without understanding also? Do you not know that whatever thing enters a man from outside cannot defile him
","\u201cbecause it did not enter into his heart
 but into the belly. And it goes out into the draught
 which is the purging of all food?\u201d","Then He said
 \u201cThat which comes out of man
 that defiles man.","\u201cFor from within
 even out of the heart of men
 proceeds evil thoughts
 adulteries
 fornications
 murders
","\u201cthefts
 covetousness
 wickedness
 deceit
 uncleanness
 a wicked eye
 backbiting
 pride
 foolishness.","\u201cAll these evil things come from within and defile a man.\u201d","But Jesus said to her
 \u201cLet the children first be fed. For it is not good to take the children\u2019s bread and cast it to the dogs.","Then He said to her
 \u201cBecause you have said this
 go your way. The demon has gone out of your daughter.\u201d","And looking up to Heaven
 He sighed
 and said to him
 \u201cEphphatha.\u201d That is
 \u201cBe opened.\u201d","In those days
 when there was a very great multitude and they had nothing to eat
 Jesus called His disciples to Him and said to them
","\u201cI have compassion on the multitude
 because they have now continued with me three days and have nothing to eat.","\u201cAnd if I send them away fasting to their own houses
 they would faint on the way.\u201d For some of them came from far away.","And He asked them
 \u201cHow many loaves do you have?\u201d And they said
 \u201cSeven.\u201d","Then He sighed deeply in His Spirit
 and said
 \u201cWhy does this generation seek a sign? Truly I say to you
 a sign shall not be given to this generation.\u201d","And He charged them
 saying
 \u201cBeware of the leaven of the Pharisees
 and of the leaven of Herod.\u201d","And when Jesus knew it
 He said to them
 \u201cWhy do you reason \u2018because we have no bread\u2019? Do you not yet perceive nor understand? Are your hearts still hardened?","\u201cDo you have eyes and not see? And do you have ears and not hear? And do you not remember?","\u201cWhen I broke the five loaves among five thousand
 how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?\u201d  They said to Him
 \u201cTwelve.\u201d","\u201cAnd when I broke seven among four thousand
 how many baskets full of leftovers did you take up?\u201d And they said
 \u201cSeven.\u201d","Then He said to them
 \u201cHow is it that you do not understand?\u201d","Then he took the blind by the hand and led him out of the town; and spit in his eyes and put His hands upon him and asked him if he saw anything.","And He sent him home to his house
 saying
 \u201cDo not go into the town. And do not tell of this to anyone in the town.\u201d","And Jesus went out with His disciples into the towns of Caesarea Philippi. And along the way He asked His disciples
 saying to them
 \u201cWhom do men say that I am?\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cBut whom do you say that I am?\u201d Then Peter answered
 and said to Him
 \u201cYou are the Christ.\u201d","Then He turned back and looked at His disciples and rebuked Peter
 saying
 \u201cGet behind Me
 Satan! For you do not understand the things that are of God
 but the things that are of men!\u201d","And He called the people to Him
 with His disciples

 \u201cWhoever will follow Me
 let him forsake himself
 and take up his cross
 and follow Me.","\u201cFor whoever will save his life
 shall lose it. But whoever shall lose his life
 for My sake
 and the Gospel\u2019s
 shall save it.","\u201cFor what shall it profit a man
 though he should win the whole world
 if he loses his soul?","\u201cOr what shall a man exchange for his soul?","\u201cFor whoever among this adulterous and sinful generation shall be ashamed of Me and of My words
 of him shall the Son of Man also be ashamed when He comes in the glory of His Father with the holy angels.\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cTruly I say to you that there are some of those who stand here who shall not taste of death till they have seen the Kingdom of God come with power.\u201d","Then Peter answered
 and said to Jesus
 \u201cMaster
 it is good for us to be here. Let us make three tabernacles; one for You
 one for Moses
 and one for Elijah.\u201d","And He answered
 and said to them
 \u201cElijah truly shall come first
 and restore all things. And as it is written of the Son of Man
 He must suffer many things and be rejected.","\u201cBut I say to you
 that Elijah has come
 and they have done to him whatever they would
 as it is written of him.\u201d","Then He asked the Scribes
 \u201cWhat are you disputing among yourselves?\u201d","Then Jesus answered him
 and said
 \u201cO faithless generation! How long now shall I be with you? How long now shall I put up with you?! Bring him to Me.\u201d","Then He asked his father
 \u201cHow long has he been this way?\u201d And he said
 \u201cHis whole childhood.","And Jesus said to him
 \u201cIf you can believe it
 all things are possible to the one who believes.\u201d","When Jesus saw that the people came running together
 He rebuked the unclean spirit
 saying to him
 \u201cYou dumb and deaf spirit
 I command you come out of him! And enter into him no more!\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cThis kind can come forth by no other means but prayer and fasting.\u201d","For He taught His disciples
 and said to them
 \u201cThe Son of Man shall be delivered into the hands of men
 and they shall kill Him. But after He is killed
 He shall rise again the third day.\u201d","After that
 He came to Capernaum. And when He was in the house
 He asked them
 \u201cWhat were you disputing among you on the way?\u201d","And He sat down and called the twelve
 and said to them
 \u201cIf anyone desires to be first
 the same shall be last of all
 and servant to all.\u201d","And He took a little child and set him in the midst of them. And He took him in His arms and said to them
","But Jesus said
 \u201cDo no forbid him. For there is no one who can do a miracle by My Name

 is on our side.","\u201cAnd whoever shall give you a cup of water to drink for My Name\u2019s sake (because you belong to Christ)

 he shall not lose his reward.","\u201cAnd whoever shall cause one of these little ones who believes in Me to stumble
 it were better for him if a millstone were hanged around his neck and that he were cast into the sea.","\u201cSo if your hand causes you to sin
 cut it off. It is better for you to enter life maimed

","\u201cLikewise
 if your foot causes you to sin
 cut it off. It is better for you to enter life lame
 than to have two feet and be cast into hell; into the fire that never shall be quenched
","\u201cAnd if your eye causes you to sin
 pluck it out. It is better for you to go into the Kingdom of God with one eye
 than to have two eyes and be cast into hell fire
","\u2018Where their worm dies not
 and the fire never goes out.\u2019","\u201cFor everyone shall be salted with fire. And every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.","\u201cSalt is good
 but if the salt is tasteless
 with what shall it be seasoned? Have salt in yourselves and have peace one with another.\u201d","And He answered
 and said to them
 \u201cWhat did Moses command you?\u201d","\u201cThen Jesus answered
 and said to them
 \u201cHe wrote this precept to you because of the hardness of your heart.","\u201cBut at the beginning of the creation
 \u2018God made them male and female.\u2019","\u201c\u2018For this cause shall man leave his father and mother
 and cling to his wife.","\u201c\u2018And the two shall be one flesh.\u2019 So that they are no more two
 but one flesh.","\u201cTherefore
 what God has coupled together
 let not man separate.\u201d","And He said to them
\u201cWhoever shall divorce his wife and marry another
 commits adultery against her.","\u201cAnd if a woman divorces her husband
 and marries another
 she commits adultery.\u201d","But when Jesus saw it
 He was displeased and said to them
 \u201cLet the little children to come to Me. And do not forbid them. For of such is the Kingdom of God.","\u201cTruly I say to you
 whoever shall not receive the Kingdom of God as a little child shall not enter therein.\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cWhy do you call Me good? There is no one good but One
 even God.","\u201cYou know the commandments
 You shall not commit adultery. You shall not kill. You shall not steal. You shall not bear false witness. You shall hurt no man. Honor your father and mother.","Then he answered
 and said to Him
 \u201cMaster
 all these things have I observed from my youth.\u201d","And Jesus looked upon him and loved him and said to him
 \u201cOne thing you lack. Go and sell all that you have. And give to the poor. And you shall have treasure in Heaven. And come
 follow Me. And take up the Cross.","And Jesus looked around and said to His disciples
 \u201cHow hard it is for those who have riches to enter into the Kingdom of God!\u201d","And His disciples were afraid at His words. But Jesus answered again and said to them
 \u201cChildren
 how hard is it for those who trust in riches to enter into the Kingdom of God!","It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God.\u201d","And they were much more astonished
 saying among themselves
 \u201cWho then can be saved?\u201d","But Jesus looked upon them
 and said
 \u201cWith men it is impossible
 but not with God. For with God
 all things are possible.\u201d","Jesus answered
 and said
 \u201cTruly I say to you
 there is no one who has forsaken house or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for My sake and the Gospels
","who shall not receive a hundredfold - now presently - houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands - with persecutions - and in the world to come
 eternal life.","\u201cBut many who are first
 shall be last; and the last
 first.\u201d","saying
 \u201cBehold
 we go up to Jerusalem. And the Son of Man shall be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes. And they shall condemn Him to death and shall deliver Him to the Gentiles.","\u201cAnd they shall mock Him and scourge Him and spit upon Him and kill Him. But the third day
 He shall rise again.\u201d","Then James and John
 the sons of Zebedee
 came to Him

 \u201cMaster
 we ask that You would do for us that which we desire.\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cWhat would that be?\u201d","But Jesus said to them
 \u201cYou do not know what you ask. Can you drink of the same cup as Me
 and be baptized with the same baptism?\u201d","And they said to Him
 \u201cWe can.\u201d But Jesus said to them
 \u201cYou shall indeed drink of the same cup
 and be baptized with the same baptism.","\u201cBut to sit at My right hand and at My left is not Mine to give. But rather
 it shall be given to those for whom it is prepared.\u201d","But Jesus called them to Him
 and said to them
 \u201cYou know that those who are princes among the Gentiles
 have dominion over them. And those who are great among them exercise authority over them.","\u201cBut it shall not be so among you. For whoever desires to be great among you shall be your servant.","\u201cAnd whoever desires to be your leader shall be the servant of all.","\u201cFor even the Son of Man did not come to be served
 but to serve; and to give His life for the ransom of many.\u201d","Then Jesus stood still and commanded him to be called. And they called the blind man

 \u201cBe of good cheer! Arise
 He calls you.\u201d","And Jesus answered
 and said to him
 \u201cWhat would you have Me do for you?\u201d And the blind said to Him
 \u201cLord
 that I may receive sight.\u201d","Then Jesus said to him
 \u201cGo your way. Your faith has saved you.\u201d And immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus on the way.","and said to them
 \u201cGo into that town over there. And as soon as you enter it
 you shall find a colt tied
 upon which never a man sat. Untie him and bring him.","\u201cAnd if anyone says to you
 \u2018Why are you doing this?\u2019 Say that the Lord has need of him. And He will return him immediately.\u201d","Then Jesus answered
 and said to it
 \u201cNever shall anyone eat fruit from you again while the world stands.\u201d And His disciples heard it.","And He taught
 saying to them
 \u201cIs it not written
 \u2018My house shall be called the house of prayer

 and said to them
 \u201cHave the faith of God.","\u201cFor truly I say to you
 that whoever shall say to this mountain
 \u2018Be taken away and cast into the sea\u2019

 whatever he says shall be done to you.","\u201cTherefore I say to you
 whatever you desire when you pray
 believe that you shall have it and it shall be done to you.","\u201cBut when you shall stand and pray
 forgive (if you have anything against anyone) that your Father also
 Who is in Heaven
 may forgive you your trespasses.","Then Jesus answered
 and said to them
 \u201cI will also ask you a certain thing. Answer Me
 and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.","\u201cThe baptism of John
 was it from Heaven
 or from men? answer Me.\u201d","Then they answered
 and said to Jesus
 \u201cWe cannot tell.\u201d And Jesus answered
 and said to them
 \u201cNor will I tell you by what authority I do these things.\u201d","And He began to speak to them in parables
 \u201cA certain man planted a vineyard
 and surrounded it with a hedge

 he sent a servant to them
 so that he might receive word about the fruit of the vineyard.","\u201cBut they took him
 and beat him
 and sent him away empty.","\u201cAnd again he sent another servant to them. And they cast stones at him
 and struck his head
 and sent him away shamefully-handled.","\u201cAnd again he sent another. And they killed him - and many others - beating some and killing some.","\u201cHe still had one son
 his dear beloved. Lastly
 he also sent him to them

 \u2018They will respect my son.\u2019","\u201cBut the farmers said among themselves
 \u2018This is the heir. Come
 let us kill him. And the inheritance shall be ours.\u2019","\u201cSo they took him and killed him and cast him out of the vineyard.","\u201cWhat shall then the Lord of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy these farmers and give the vineyard to others.","\u201cHave you not read so much as this Scripture
 \u2018The stone which the builders refused
 has become the cornerstone.","\u201c\u2018This was done by the Lord. And it is marvelous in our eyes\u2019?\u201d","And they sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians to Him

 and He said to them
 \u201cWhose image and superscription is this?\u201d And they said to Him
 \u201cCaesar\u2019s.\u201d","Then Jesus answered
 and said to them
 \u201cGive to Caesar the things that are Caesar\u2019s

 those that are God\u2019s.\u201d And they marveled at Him.","Then Jesus answered
 and said to them
 \u201cAre you not therefore deceived
 because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God?","\u201cFor when they shall rise again from the dead
 neither men nor wives marry
 but are as the angels which are in Heaven.","\u201cAnd as for the dead
 they shall rise again. Have you not read in the book of Moses how
 in the bush
 God spoke to him
 saying
 \u2018I am the God of Abraham

 but the God of the living. You are therefore greatly deceived.\u201d","Then came one of the scribes who had heard them disputing together. And perceiving that he had answered them well
 he asked him
 \u201cWhich is the first commandment of all?","Jesus answered him
 \u201cThe first of all the Commandments is
 \u2018Hear
 Israel
 The Lord our God is the only Lord.","\u201c\u2018You shall therefore love the Lord your God with all your heart
 and with all your soul
 and with all your mind
 and with all your strength.\u2019 This is the first Commandment.","\u201cAnd the second is similar; that is
 \u2018You shall love your neighbor as yourself.\u2019 There is no other Commandment greater than these.\u201d","Then when Jesus saw that he answered wisely
 He said to him
 \u201cYou are not far from the Kingdom of God.\u201d And no one dared to ask Him any question after that.","And Jesus answered and said (teaching in the Temple)
 \u201cHow can the scribes say that Christ is the Son of David?","\u201cFor David himself said by the Holy Ghost
 \u2018The Lord said to my Lord
 \u2018Sit at My right hand
 till I make your enemies your footstool.","\u201cThen David himself called him Lord. By what means is He then his son?\u201d And many people heard Him gladly.","Moreover He said to them in His doctrine
 \u201cBeware of the scribes

","\u201cand the chief seats in the synagogues
 and the first rooms at feasts.","\u201cThey devour widows\u2019 houses
 even under a color of long prayers. These shall receive the greater damnation.\u201d","Then He called His disciples to Him
 and said to them
 \u201cTruly I say to you
 that this poor widow has cast more in than all those who have cast into the treasury.","For they all cast in out of their excess. But she
 out of her poverty
 cast in all that she had
 even all her living.\u201d","And as He went out of the Temple
 one of His disciples said to Him
 \u201cMaster
 see what stones and buildings are here.\u201d","Then Jesus answered and said to him
 \u201cYou see these great buildings? There shall not be left one stone upon a stone that shall not be thrown down.\u201d","And Jesus answered them
 and began to say
\u201cBeware
 lest anyone deceive you.","\u201cFor many shall come in My Name
 saying
 \u2018I am Christ\u2019

 when you shall hear of wars
 and rumors of wars
 do not be troubled. For such things must be. But the end shall not be yet.","\u201cFor nation shall rise against nation
 and kingdom against kingdom. And there shall be earthquakes in diverse quarters. And there shall be famine and troubles. These are the beginnings of sorrows.","\u201cBut beware. For they shall deliver you up to the councils
 and to the synagogues. You shall be beaten and brought before rulers and kings for My sake; for a testimonial to them.","\u201cAnd the Gospel must first be proclaimed among all nations.","\u201cBut when they deliver you up
 do not be careful beforehand
 nor study what you shall say. But speak what is given to you at that time. For it is not you who speaks
 but the Holy Ghost.","\u201cIndeed
 and the brother shall deliver the brother to death
 and the father the son. And the children shall rise against their parents and shall cause them to die.","\u201cAnd you shall be hated by all for My Name\u2019s sake. But whoever shall endure to the end
 shall be saved.","\u201cMoreover
 when you shall see the Abomination of Desolation (spoken of by Daniel the Prophet) set where it ought not be
 let whoever hears consider it. Then let those who are in Judea flee into the mountains.","\u201cAnd let no one who is upon the house come down into the house
 nor enter into it to fetch anything out of his house.","\u201cAnd let no one who is in the field turn back again to take his garment.","\u201cThen woe shall be to those who are with child
 and to those who nurse in those days.","\u201cPray
 therefore
 that your flight is not in the winter.","\u201cFor those days shall be such tribulation as was not from the beginning of the Creation (which God created) until this time
 nor shall be.","\u201cAnd except that the Lord had shortened those days
 no flesh should be saved. But for the Elect\u2019s sake (which He has chosen) He has shortened those days.","\u201cThen
 if anyone says to you
 \u2018Lo
 here is christ\u2019
 or \u2018Look
 he is there\u2019
 do not believe it.","\u201cFor false christs shall rise
 and false prophets
 and shall show signs and wonders to deceive (if it were possible) the very Elect.","\u201cBut beware. Behold
 I have shown you all things before.","\u201cMoreover
 in those days
 after that tribulation
 the sun shall grow dark. And the moon shall not give her light.","\u201cAnd the stars of heaven shall fall. And the powers which are in heaven shall shake.","\u201cAnd then they shall see the Son of Man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.","\u201cAnd then He shall send his angels and shall gather together His Elect from the four winds and from the utmost part of the earth to the utmost part of Heaven.","\u201cNow learn a parable of the fig tree. When her branch is still tender
 and it brings forth leaves
 you know that summer is near.","\u201cSo
 in like manner
 when you see these things come to pass
 know that the Kingdom of God is near
 even at the doors.","\u201cTruly I say to you that this generation shall not pass till all these things are done.","\u201cHeaven and Earth shall pass away
 but My words shall not pass away.","\u201cBut of that day and hour knows no one. No
 not the angels who are in Heaven
 nor the Son Himself
 but the Father.","\u201cBeware. Watch; and pray. For you do not know when the time is.","\u201cFor the Son of Man is as a man who goes into a strange country and leaves his house
 and gives authority to his servants
 and to everyone his work
 and commands the doorman to watch.","Watch
 therefore. For you do not know when the master of the house will come - at evening or at midnight
 at the cock crowing or in the dawning.","Lest
 if he comes suddenly
 he should find you sleeping.","And these things that I say to you
 I say to all. Watch.","Therefore some whispered angrily among themselves
 and said
 \u201cTo what end is this waste of ointment?","But Jesus said
 \u201cLet her alone. Why do you trouble yourselves with her? She has done a good work for Me.","\u201cFor you have the poor with you always. And when you will you may do them good. But Me you shall not have always.","\u201cShe has done what she could. She came beforehand to anoint My body for the burying.","\u201cTruly I say to you
 wherever this Gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world
 this also that she has done
 shall be spoken of in remembrance of her.\u201d","Then He sent forth two of His disciples
 and said to them
 \u201cGo into the city
 and there a man shall meet you bearing a pitcher of water. Follow him.","\u201cAnd wherever he goes in
 say to the good man of the house
 \u2018The Master says
 \u201cWhere is the lodging where I shall eat the Passover with My disciples?\u201d\u2019","\u201cAnd he will show you an upper chamber
 which is large
 trimmed and prepared. Make it ready for us there.\u201d","And as they sat at table and ate
 Jesus said
 \u201cTruly I say to you
 that one of you who eats with Me shall betray Me.\u201d","And He answered and said to them
 \u201cIt is one of the twelve who dips with Me in the platter.","\u201cTruly the Son of Man goes his way
 as it is written of Him. But woe be to that man
 by whom the Son of Man is betrayed. It had been good for that man if he had never been born.\u201d","And as they ate
 Jesus took the bread. And when He had given thanks
 He broke it and gave it to them and said
 \u201cTake. Eat. This is My body.\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cThis is My blood of the New Testament
 which is shed for many.","\u201cTruly I say to you
 I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine until that day that I drink it new
 in the Kingdom of God.\u201d","Then Jesus said to them
 \u201cAll of you shall desert Me this night. For it is written
 \u2018I will strike the Shepherd
 and the sheep shall be scattered.\u2019","\u201cBut after I am risen
 I will go into Galilee before you.\u201d","Then Jesus said to him
 \u201cTruly I say to you
 this day
 even this night
 before the cock crows twice
 you shall deny Me three times.\u201d","Afterward
 they came into a place named Gethsemane. Then He said to His disciples
 \u201cSit here
 till I have prayed.\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cMy soul is very heavy
 even to the death. Wait here
 and watch.\u201d","And He said
 \u201cAbba
 Father. All things are possible for You. Take away this cup from Me. Nevertheless
 not that I will
 but that You will
 be done.\u201d","Then He came
 and found them sleeping
 and said to Peter
 \u201cSimon. Asleep? Could you not watch one hour?","\u201cWatch
 and pray. So that you do not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is ready
 but the flesh is weak.\u201d","And He came the third time and said to them
 \u201cSleep on now
 and take your rest. It is enough. The hour has come. Behold
 the Son of Man is delivered into the hands of sinners.","\u201cRise up! Let us go. Lo
 he who betrays Me is here.\u201d","And Jesus answered and said to them
 \u201cYou\u2019ve come out as against a thief
 with swords and with clubs
 to take Me.","\u201cI was with you daily
 teaching in the Temple
 and you did not take Me. But this is done so that the Scriptures would be fulfilled.\u201d","And Jesus said
 \u201cI am He. And you shall see the Son of Man sit at the right hand of power
 coming in the clouds of Heaven.\u201d","And some began to spit at Him
 and to cover His face
 and to beat Him with fists
 and to say to Him
 \u201cProphesy.\u201d And the sergeants slapped Him.","Then the cock crew the second time. And Peter remembered the word that Jesus had said to him
 \u2018Before the cock crows twice
 you shall deny Me three times.\u2019 And feeling the weight of that
 he wept.","Then Pilate asked Him
 \u201cAre you the King of the Jews?\u201d And He answered
 and said to him
 \u201cYou have said so.\u201d","Then Pilate answered them
 and said
 \u201cShould I release to you the King of the Jews?\u201d","And at the ninth hour
 Jesus cried with a loud voice
 saying
 \u201cEloi
 Eloi
 lama-sabachthani?\u201d Which is by interpretation
 \u201cMy God
 My God
 why have You forsaken Me?\u201d","Now when the centurion who stood near Him saw that He
 thus crying
 gave up the ghost
 he said
 \u201cTruly this man was the Son of God.\u201d","And Pilate was surprised that He was already dead
 So
 he called the centurion and asked him whether He were indeed dead.","And they said to each other
 \u201cWho shall we have roll away the stone from the door of the sepulcher?\u201d","But he said to them
 \u201cDo not be so troubled. You seek Jesus of Nazareth
 Who was crucified. He is risen. He is not here. Behold the place where they put Him.","And He said to them
 \u201cGo into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature.","\u201cThe one who shall believe
 and be baptized
 shall be saved. But the one who will not believe
 shall be damned.","\u201cAnd these signs shall follow those who believe: In my Name
 they shall cast out demons
 and shall speak with new tongues
","\u201cand shall take away serpents. And if they shall drink any deadly thing
 it shall not hurt them. They shall lay their hands on the sick
 and they shall recover.\u201d","The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ
 the Son of God.","and saying
 \u201cThe time is fulfilled
 and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent
 and believe in the gospel.\u201d","And Jesus said to them
 \u201cFollow me and I will make you become fishers of men.\u201d ","But Jesus rebuked him
 saying
 \u201cBe silent
 and come out of him!\u201d ","and they found him and said to him
 \u201cEvery one is searching for you.\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cLet us go on to the next towns
 that I may preach there also; for that is why I came out.\u201d ","Moved with pity
 he stretched out his hand and touched him
 and said to him
 \u201cI will; be clean.\u201d ","and said to him
 \u201cSee that you say nothing to any one; but go
 show yourself to the priest
 and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded
 for a proof to the people.\u201d ","And when Jesus saw their faith
 he said to the paralytic
 \u201cMy son
 your sins are forgiven.\u201d ","And immediately Jesus
 perceiving in his spirit that they thus questioned within themselves
 said to them
 \u201cWhy do you question thus in your hearts? ","Which is easier
 to say to the paralytic
 \u2018Your sins are forgiven
\u2019 or to say
 \u2018Rise
 take up your pallet and walk\u2019? ","But that you may know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins\u201d\u2014he said to the paralytic\u2014","\u201cI say to you
 rise
 take up your pallet and go home.\u201d ","And as he passed on
 he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax office
 and he said to him
 \u201cFollow me.\u201d And he rose and followed him.","And when Jesus heard it
 he said to them
 \u201cThose who are well have no need of a physician
 but those who are sick; I came not to call the righteous
 but sinners.\u201d","And Jesus said to them
 \u201cCan the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them
 they cannot fast. ","The days will come
 when the bridegroom is taken away from them
 and then they will fast in that day. ","No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; if he does
 the patch tears away from it
 the new from the old
 and a worse tear is made. ","And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; if he does
 the wine will burst the skins
 and the wine is lost
 and so are the skins; but new wine is for fresh skins.\u201d","And the Pharisees said to him
 \u201cLook
 why are they doing what is not lawful on the sabbath?\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cHave you never read what David did
 when he was in need and was hungry
 he and those who were with him: ","And he said to them
 \u201cThe sabbath was made for man
 not man for the sabbath; ","so the Son of man is lord even of the sabbath.\u201d","And he said to the man who had the withered hand
 \u201cCome here.\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cIs it lawful on the sabbath to do good or to do harm
 to save life or to kill?\u201d But they were silent. ","And he looked around at them with anger
 grieved at their hardness of heart
 and said to the man
 \u201cStretch out your hand.\u201d He stretched it out
 and his hand was restored. ","And he called them to him
 and said to them in parables
 \u201cHow can Satan cast out Satan? ","If a kingdom is divided against itself
 that kingdom cannot stand. ","And if a house is divided against itself
 that house will not be able to stand. ","And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided
 he cannot stand
 but is coming to an end. ","But no one can enter a strong man\u2019s house and plunder his goods
 unless he first binds the strong man; then indeed he may plunder his house.","\u201cTruly
 I say to you
 all sins will be forgiven the sons of men
 and whatever blasphemies they utter; ","but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness
 but is guilty of an eternal sin\u201d\u2014 ","And a crowd was sitting about him; and they said to him
 \u201cYour mother and your brothers are outside
 asking for you.\u201d ","And he replied
 \u201cWho are my mother and my brothers?\u201d ","And looking around on those who sat about him
 he said
 \u201cHere are my mother and my brothers! ","Whoever does the will of God is my brother
 and sister
 and mother.\u201d","And he taught them many things in parables
 and in his teaching he said to them: ","\u201cListen! A sower went out to sow.","And as he sowed
 some seed fell along the path
 and the birds came and devoured it. ","Other seed fell on rocky ground
 where it had not much soil
 and immediately it sprang up
 since it had no depth of soil; ","and when the sun rose it was scorched
 and since it had no root it withered away. ","Other seed fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked it
 and it yielded no grain. ","And other seeds fell into good soil and brought forth grain
 growing up and increasing and yielding thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold.\u201d ","And he said
 \u201cHe who has ears to hear
 let him hear.\u201d","And he said to them
 \u201cTo you has been given the secret of the kingdom of God
 but for those outside everything is in parables; ","so that they may indeed see but not perceive
 and may indeed hear but not understand; lest they should turn again
 and be forgiven.\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cDo you not understand this parable? How then will you understand all the parables? ","The sower sows the word.","And these are the ones along the path
 where the word is sown; when they hear
 Satan immediately comes and takes away the word which is sown in them. ","And these in like manner are the ones sown upon rocky ground
 who
 when they hear the word
 immediately receive it with joy; ","and they have no root in themselves
 but endure for a while; then
 when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word
 immediately they fall away. ","And others are the ones sown among thorns; they are those who hear the word
 ","but the cares of the world
 and the delight in riches
 and the desire for other things
 enter in and choke the word
 and it proves unfruitful. ","But those that were sown upon the good soil are the ones who hear the word and accept it and bear fruit
 thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold.\u201d","And he said to them
 \u201cIs a lamp brought in to be put under a bushel
 or under a bed
 and not on a stand? ","For there is nothing hid
 except to be made manifest; nor is anything secret
 except to come to light. ","If any man has ears to hear
 let him hear.\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cTake heed what you hear; the measure you give will be the measure you get
 and still more will be given you. ","For to him who has will more be given; and from him who has not
 even what he has will be taken away.\u201d","And he said
 \u201cThe kingdom of God is as if a man should scatter seed upon the ground
 ","and should sleep and rise night and day
 and the seed should sprout and grow
 he knows not how. ","The earth produces of itself
 first the blade
 then the ear
 then the full grain in the ear. ","But when the grain is ripe
 at once he puts in the sickle
 because the harvest has come.\u201d","And he said
 \u201cWith what can we compare the kingdom of God
 or what parable shall we use for it? ","It is like a grain of mustard seed
 which
 when sown upon the ground
 is the smallest of all the seeds on earth; ","yet when it is sown it grows up and becomes the greatest of all shrubs
 and puts forth large branches
 so that the birds of the air can make nests in its shade.\u201d","On that day
 when evening had come
 he said to them
 \u201cLet us go across to the other side.\u201d ","And he awoke and rebuked the wind
 and said to the sea
 \u201cPeace! Be still!\u201d And the wind ceased
 and there was a great calm. ","He said to them
 \u201cWhy are you afraid? Have you no faith?\u201d ","For he had said to him
 \u201cCome out of the man
 you unclean spirit!\u201d ","And Jesus asked him
 \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d He replied
 \u201cMy name is Legion; for we are many.\u201d ","But he refused
 and said to him
 \u201cGo home to your friends
 and tell them how much the Lord has done for you
 and how he has had mercy on you.\u201d ","For she said
 \u201cIf I touch even his garments
 I shall be made well.\u201d ","And his disciples said to him
 \u201cYou see the crowd pressing around you
 and yet you say
 \u2018Who touched me?\u2019\u201d ","And he said to her
 \u201cDaughter
 your faith has made you well; go in peace
 and be healed of your disease.\u201d","But ignoring what they said
 Jesus said to the ruler of the synagogue
 \u201cDo not fear
 only believe.\u201d ","And when he had entered
 he said to them
 \u201cWhy do you make a tumult and weep? The child is not dead but sleeping.\u201d ","Taking her by the hand he said to her
 \u201cTal\u2032itha cu\u2032mi\u201d; which means
 \u201cLittle girl
 I say to you
 arise.\u201d ","And Jesus said to them
 \u201cA prophet is not without honor
 except in his own country
 and among his own kin
 and in his own house.\u201d ","And he called to him the twelve
 and began to send them out two by two
 and gave them authority over the unclean spirits. ","And he said to them
 \u201cWhere you enter a house
 stay there until you leave the place. ","And if any place will not receive you and they refuse to hear you
 when you leave
 shake off the dust that is on your feet for a testimony against them.\u201d ","But when Herod heard of it he said
 \u201cJohn
 whom I beheaded
 has been raised.\u201d ","For when Hero\u2032di-as\u2019 daughter came in and danced
 she pleased Herod and his guests; and the king said to the girl
 \u201cAsk me for whatever you wish
 and I will grant it.\u201d ","And she went out
 and said to her mother
 \u201cWhat shall I ask?\u201d And she said
 \u201cThe head of John the baptizer.\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cCome away by yourselves to a lonely place
 and rest a while.\u201d For many were coming and going
 and they had no leisure even to eat. ","But he answered them
 \u201cYou give them something to eat.\u201d And they said to him
 \u201cShall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread
 and give it to them to eat?\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cHow many loaves have you? Go and see.\u201d And when they had found out
 they said
 \u201cFive
 and two fish.\u201d ","for they all saw him
 and were terrified. But immediately he spoke to them and said
 \u201cTake heart
 it is I; have no fear.\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cWell did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites
 as it is written
 \u2018This people honors me with their lips
 but their heart is far from me;","in vain do they worship me
 teaching as doctrines the precepts of men.\u2019","You leave the commandment of God
 and hold fast the tradition of men.\u201d","And he said to them
 \u201cYou have a fine way of rejecting the commandment of God
 in order to keep your tradition! ","For Moses said
 \u2018Honor your father and your mother\u2019; and
 \u2018He who speaks evil of father or mother
 let him surely die\u2019; ","but you say
 \u2018If a man tells his father or his mother
 What you would have gained from me is Corban\u2019 (that is
 given to God)\u2014 ","then you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or mother
 ","thus making void the word of God through your tradition which you hand on. And many such things you do.\u201d","And he called the people to him again
 and said to them
 \u201cHear me
 all of you
 and understand: ","there is nothing outside a man which by going into him can defile him; but the things which come out of a man are what defile him.\u201d","And he said to them
 \u201cThen are you also without understanding? Do you not see that whatever goes into a man from outside cannot defile him
 ","since it enters
 not his heart but his stomach
 and so passes on?\u201d (Thus he declared all foods clean.) ","And he said
 \u201cWhat comes out of a man is what defiles a man. ","For from within
 out of the heart of man
 come evil thoughts
 fornication
 theft
 murder
 adultery
 ","coveting
 wickedness
 deceit
 licentiousness
 envy
 slander
 pride
 foolishness. ","All these evil things come from within
 and they defile a man.\u201d","And he said to her
 \u201cLet the children first be fed
 for it is not right to take the children\u2019s bread and throw it to the dogs.\u201d ","And he said to her
 \u201cFor this saying you may go your way; the demon has left your daughter.\u201d ","and looking up to heaven
 he sighed
 and said to him
 \u201cEph\u2032phatha
\u201d that is
 \u201cBe opened.\u201d ","In those days
 when again a great crowd had gathered
 and they had nothing to eat
 he called his disciples to him
 and said to them
 ","\u201cI have compassion on the crowd
 because they have been with me now three days
 and have nothing to eat; ","and if I send them away hungry to their homes
 they will faint on the way; and some of them have come a long way.\u201d ","And he asked them
 \u201cHow many loaves have you?\u201d They said
 \u201cSeven.\u201d ","And he sighed deeply in his spirit
 and said
 \u201cWhy does this generation seek a sign? Truly
 I say to you
 no sign shall be given to this generation.\u201d ","And he cautioned them
 saying
 \u201cTake heed
 beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.\u201d ","And being aware of it
 Jesus said to them
 \u201cWhy do you discuss the fact that you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive or understand? Are your hearts hardened? ","Having eyes do you not see
 and having ears do you not hear? And do you not remember? ","When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand
 how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?\u201d They said to him
 \u201cTwelve.\u201d ","\u201cAnd the seven for the four thousand
 how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?\u201d And they said to him
 \u201cSeven.\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cDo you not yet understand?\u201d","And he took the blind man by the hand
 and led him out of the village; and when he had spit on his eyes and laid his hands upon him
 he asked him
 \u201cDo you see anything?\u201d ","And he sent him away to his home
 saying
 \u201cDo not even enter the village.\u201d","And Jesus went on with his disciples
 to the villages of Caesare\u2032a Philippi; and on the way he asked his disciples
 \u201cWho do men say that I am?\u201d ","And he asked them
 \u201cBut who do you say that I am?\u201d Peter answered him
 \u201cYou are the Christ.\u201d ","But turning and seeing his disciples
 he rebuked Peter
 and said
 \u201cGet behind me
 Satan! For you are not on the side of God
 but of men.\u201d","And he called to him the multitude with his disciples
 and said to them
 \u201cIf any man would come after me
 let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. ","For whoever would save his life will lose it; and whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospel\u2019s will save it.","For what does it profit a man
 to gain the whole world and forfeit his life? ","For what can a man give in return for his life?","For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation
 of him will the Son of man also be ashamed
 when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cTruly
 I say to you
 there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see that the kingdom of God has come with power.\u201d","And Peter said to Jesus
 \u201cMaster
 it is well that we are here; let us make three booths
 one for you and one for Moses and one for Eli\u2032jah.\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cEli\u2032jah does come first to restore all things; and how is it written of the Son of man
 that he should suffer many things and be treated with contempt? ","But I tell you that Eli\u2032jah has come
 and they did to him whatever they pleased
 as it is written of him.\u201d","And he asked them
 \u201cWhat are you discussing with them?\u201d ","And he answered them
 \u201cO faithless generation
 how long am I to be with you? How long am I to bear with you? Bring him to me.\u201d ","And Jesus asked his father
 \u201cHow long has he had this?\u201d And he said
 \u201cFrom childhood. ","And Jesus said to him
 \u201cIf you can! All things are possible to him who believes.\u201d ","And when Jesus saw that a crowd came running together
 he rebuked the unclean spirit
 saying to it
 \u201cYou dumb and deaf spirit
 I command you
 come out of him
 and never enter him again.\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cThis kind cannot be driven out by anything but prayer.\u201d","for he was teaching his disciples
 saying to them
 \u201cThe Son of man will be delivered into the hands of men

 after three days he will rise.\u201d ","And they came to Caper\u2032na-um; and when he was in the house he asked them
 \u201cWhat were you discussing on the way?\u201d ","And he sat down and called the twelve; and he said to them
 \u201cIf any one would be first
 he must be last of all and servant of all.\u201d ","And he took a child
 and put him in the midst of them; and taking him in his arms
 he said to them
 ","But Jesus said
 \u201cDo not forbid him; for no one who does a mighty work in my name will be able soon after to speak evil of me. ","For he that is not against us is for us.","For truly
 I say to you
 whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you bear the name of Christ
 will by no means lose his reward.","\u201cWhoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin
 it would be better for him if a great millstone were hung round his neck and he were thrown into the sea. ","And if your hand causes you to sin
 cut it off; it is better for you to enter life maimed than with two hands to go to hell
 to the unquenchable fire. ","And if your foot causes you to sin
 cut it off; it is better for you to enter life lame than with two feet to be thrown into hell. ","And if your eye causes you to sin
 pluck it out; it is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into hell

 and the fire is not quenched. ","For every one will be salted with fire.","Salt is good; but if the salt has lost its saltness
 how will you season it? Have salt in yourselves
 and be at peace with one another.\u201d","He answered them
 \u201cWhat did Moses command you?\u201d ","But Jesus said to them
 \u201cFor your hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment. ","But from the beginning of creation
 \u2018God made them male and female.\u2019 ","\u2018For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife
 ","and the two shall become one flesh.\u2019 So they are no longer two but one flesh.","What therefore God has joined together
 let not man put asunder.\u201d","And he said to them
 \u201cWhoever divorces his wife and marries another
 commits adultery against her; ","and if she divorces her husband and marries another
 she commits adultery.\u201d","But when Jesus saw it he was indignant
 and said to them
 \u201cLet the children come to me
 do not hinder them; for to such belongs the kingdom of God. ","Truly
 I say to you
 whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it.\u201d ","And Jesus said to him
 \u201cWhy do you call me good? No one is good but God alone. ","You know the commandments: \u2018Do not kill
 Do not commit adultery
 Do not steal
 Do not bear false witness
 Do not defraud
 Honor your father and mother.\u2019\u201d ","And he said to him
 \u201cTeacher
 all these I have observed from my youth.\u201d ","And Jesus looking upon him loved him
 and said to him
 \u201cYou lack one thing; go
 sell what you have
 and give to the poor
 and you will have treasure in heaven; and come
 follow me.\u201d ","And Jesus looked around and said to his disciples
 \u201cHow hard it will be for those who have riches to enter the kingdom of God!\u201d ","And the disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said to them again
 \u201cChildren
 how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God! ","It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.\u201d","And they were exceedingly astonished
 and said to him
 \u201cThen who can be saved?\u201d ","Jesus looked at them and said
 \u201cWith men it is impossible
 but not with God; for all things are possible with God.\u201d ","Jesus said
 \u201cTruly
 I say to you
 there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or lands
 for my sake and for the gospel
 ","who will not receive a hundredfold now in this time
 houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands
 with persecutions
 and in the age to come eternal life. ","But many that are first will be last
 and the last first.\u201d","saying
 \u201cBehold
 we are going up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes
 and they will condemn him to death
 and deliver him to the Gentiles; ","and they will mock him
 and spit upon him
 and scourge him
 and kill him; and after three days he will rise.\u201d","And James and John
 the sons of Zeb\u2032edee
 came forward to him
 and said to him
 \u201cTeacher
 we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you.\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cWhat do you want me to do for you?\u201d ","But Jesus said to them
 \u201cYou do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink
 or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?\u201d ","And they said to him
 \u201cWe are able.\u201d And Jesus said to them
 \u201cThe cup that I drink you will drink; and with the baptism with which I am baptized
 you will be baptized; ","but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant
 but it is for those for whom it has been prepared.\u201d ","And Jesus called them to him and said to them
 \u201cYou know that those who are supposed to rule over the Gentiles lord it over them
 and their great men exercise authority over them. ","But it shall not be so among you; but whoever would be great among you must be your servant
 ","and whoever would be first among you must be slave of all.","For the Son of man also came not to be served but to serve
 and to give his life as a ransom for many.\u201d","And Jesus stopped and said
 \u201cCall him.\u201d And they called the blind man
 saying to him
 \u201cTake heart; rise
 he is calling you.\u201d ","And Jesus said to him
 \u201cWhat do you want me to do for you?\u201d And the blind man said to him
 \u201cMaster
 let me receive my sight.\u201d ","And Jesus said to him
 \u201cGo your way; your faith has made you well.\u201d And immediately he received his sight and followed him on the way.","and said to them
 \u201cGo into the village opposite you
 and immediately as you enter it you will find a colt tied
 on which no one has ever sat; untie it and bring it. ","If any one says to you
 \u2018Why are you doing this?\u2019 say
 \u2018The Lord has need of it and will send it back here immediately.\u2019\u201d ","And he said to it
 \u201cMay no one ever eat fruit from you again.\u201d And his disciples heard it.","And he taught
 and said to them
 \u201cIs it not written
 \u2018My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations\u2019? But you have made it a den of robbers.\u201d ","And Jesus answered them
 \u201cHave faith in God. ","Truly
 I say to you
 whoever says to this mountain
 \u2018Be taken up and cast into the sea
\u2019 and does not doubt in his heart
 but believes that what he says will come to pass
 it will be done for him. ","Therefore I tell you
 whatever you ask in prayer
 believe that you have received it
 and it will be yours. ","And whenever you stand praying
 forgive
 if you have anything against any one; so that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cI will ask you a question; answer me
 and I will tell you by what authority I do these things. ","Was the baptism of John from heaven or from men? Answer me.\u201d","So they answered Jesus
 \u201cWe do not know.\u201d And Jesus said to them
 \u201cNeither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.\u201d","And he began to speak to them in parables. \u201cA man planted a vineyard
 and set a hedge around it
 and dug a pit for the wine press
 and built a tower
 and let it out to tenants
 and went into another country. ","When the time came
 he sent a servant to the tenants
 to get from them some of the fruit of the vineyard. ","And they took him and beat him
 and sent him away empty-handed. ","Again he sent to them another servant
 and they wounded him in the head
 and treated him shamefully. ","And he sent another
 and him they killed; and so with many others
 some they beat and some they killed. ","He had still one other
 a beloved son; finally he sent him to them
 saying
 \u2018They will respect my son.\u2019 ","But those tenants said to one another
 \u2018This is the heir; come
 let us kill him
 and the inheritance will be ours.\u2019 ","And they took him and killed him
 and cast him out of the vineyard. ","What will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the tenants
 and give the vineyard to others. ","Have you not read this scripture: \u2018The very stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner;","this was the Lord\u2019s doing
 and it is marvelous in our eyes\u2019?\u201d","And they sent to him some of the Pharisees and some of the Hero\u2032di-ans
 to entrap him in his talk. ","Should we pay them
 or should we not?\u201d But knowing their hypocrisy
 he said to them
 \u201cWhy put me to the test? Bring me a coin
 and let me look at it.\u201d ","And they brought one. And he said to them
 \u201cWhose likeness and inscription is this?\u201d They said to him
 \u201cCaesar\u2019s.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cRender to Caesar the things that are Caesar\u2019s
 and to God the things that are God\u2019s.\u201d And they were amazed at him.","Jesus said to them
 \u201cIs not this why you are wrong
 that you know neither the scriptures nor the power of God? ","For when they rise from the dead
 they neither marry nor are given in marriage
 but are like angels in heaven. ","And as for the dead being raised
 have you not read in the book of Moses
 in the passage about the bush
 how God said to him
 \u2018I am the God of Abraham
 and the God of Isaac
 and the God of Jacob\u2019? ","He is not God of the dead
 but of the living; you are quite wrong.\u201d","And one of the scribes came up and heard them disputing with one another
 and seeing that he answered them well
 asked him
 \u201cWhich commandment is the first of all?\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cThe first is
 \u2018Hear
 O Israel: The Lord our God
 the Lord is one; ","and you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart
 and with all your soul
 and with all your mind
 and with all your strength.\u2019 ","The second is this
 \u2018You shall love your neighbor as yourself.\u2019 There is no other commandment greater than these.\u201d ","And when Jesus saw that he answered wisely
 he said to him
 \u201cYou are not far from the kingdom of God.\u201d And after that no one dared to ask him any question.","And as Jesus taught in the temple
 he said
 \u201cHow can the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David? ","David himself
 inspired by the Holy Spirit
 declared
 \u2018The Lord said to my Lord
 Sit at my right hand
 till I put thy enemies under thy feet.\u2019","David himself calls him Lord; so how is he his son?\u201d And the great throng heard him gladly.","And in his teaching he said
 \u201cBeware of the scribes
 who like to go about in long robes
 and to have salutations in the market places ","and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at feasts
 ","who devour widows\u2019 houses and for a pretense make long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation.\u201d","And he called his disciples to him
 and said to them
 \u201cTruly
 I say to you
 this poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the treasury. ","For they all contributed out of their abundance; but she out of her poverty has put in everything she had
 her whole living.\u201d","And as he came out of the temple
 one of his disciples said to him
 \u201cLook
 Teacher
 what wonderful stones and what wonderful buildings!\u201d ","And Jesus said to him
 \u201cDo you see these great buildings? There will not be left here one stone upon another
 that will not be thrown down.\u201d","And Jesus began to say to them
 \u201cTake heed that no one leads you astray. ","Many will come in my name
 saying
 \u2018I am he!\u2019 and they will lead many astray. ","And when you hear of wars and rumors of wars
 do not be alarmed; this must take place
 but the end is not yet. ","For nation will rise against nation
 and kingdom against kingdom; there will be earthquakes in various places
 there will be famines; this is but the beginning of the birth-pangs.","\u201cBut take heed to yourselves; for they will deliver you up to councils; and you will be beaten in synagogues; and you will stand before governors and kings for my sake
 to bear testimony before them. ","And the gospel must first be preached to all nations.","And when they bring you to trial and deliver you up
 do not be anxious beforehand what you are to say; but say whatever is given you in that hour
 for it is not you who speak
 but the Holy Spirit. ","And brother will deliver up brother to death
 and the father his child
 and children will rise against parents and have them put to death; ","and you will be hated by all for my name\u2019s sake. But he who endures to the end will be saved.","\u201cBut when you see the desolating sacrilege set up where it ought not to be (let the reader understand)
 then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains; ","let him who is on the housetop not go down
 nor enter his house
 to take anything away; ","and let him who is in the field not turn back to take his mantle.","And alas for those who are with child and for those who give suck in those days!","Pray that it may not happen in winter.","For in those days there will be such tribulation as has not been from the beginning of the creation which God created until now
 and never will be. ","And if the Lord had not shortened the days
 no human being would be saved; but for the sake of the elect
 whom he chose
 he shortened the days. ","And then if any one says to you
 \u2018Look
 here is the Christ!\u2019 or \u2018Look
 there he is!\u2019 do not believe it. ","False Christs and false prophets will arise and show signs and wonders
 to lead astray
 if possible
 the elect. ","But take heed; I have told you all things beforehand.","\u201cBut in those days
 after that tribulation
 the sun will be darkened
 and the moon will not give its light
 ","and the stars will be falling from heaven
 and the powers in the heavens will be shaken. ","And then they will see the Son of man coming in clouds with great power and glory.","And then he will send out the angels
 and gather his elect from the four winds
 from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven.","\u201cFrom the fig tree learn its lesson: as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts forth its leaves
 you know that summer is near. ","So also
 when you see these things taking place
 you know that he is near
 at the very gates. ","Truly
 I say to you
 this generation will not pass away before all these things take place. ","Heaven and earth will pass away
 but my words will not pass away.","\u201cBut of that day or that hour no one knows
 not even the angels in heaven
 nor the Son
 but only the Father. ","Take heed
 watch; for you do not know when the time will come. ","It is like a man going on a journey
 when he leaves home and puts his servants in charge
 each with his work
 and commands the doorkeeper to be on the watch. ","Watch therefore\u2014for you do not know when the master of the house will come
 in the evening
 or at midnight
 or at cockcrow
 or in the morning\u2014 ","lest he come suddenly and find you asleep.","And what I say to you I say to all: Watch.\u201d","But there were some who said to themselves indignantly
 \u201cWhy was the ointment thus wasted? ","But Jesus said
 \u201cLet her alone; why do you trouble her? She has done a beautiful thing to me. ","For you always have the poor with you
 and whenever you will
 you can do good to them; but you will not always have me. ","She has done what she could; she has anointed my body beforehand for burying.","And truly
 I say to you
 wherever the gospel is preached in the whole world
 what she has done will be told in memory of her.\u201d","And he sent two of his disciples
 and said to them
 \u201cGo into the city
 and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you; follow him
 ","and wherever he enters
 say to the householder
 \u2018The Teacher says
 Where is my guest room
 where I am to eat the passover with my disciples?\u2019 ","And he will show you a large upper room furnished and ready; there prepare for us.\u201d","And as they were at table eating
 Jesus said
 \u201cTruly
 I say to you
 one of you will betray me
 one who is eating with me.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cIt is one of the twelve
 one who is dipping bread into the dish with me. ","For the Son of man goes as it is written of him
 but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.\u201d","And as they were eating
 he took bread
 and blessed
 and broke it
 and gave it to them
 and said
 \u201cTake; this is my body.\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cThis is my blood of the covenant
 which is poured out for many. ","Truly
 I say to you
 I shall not drink again of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.\u201d","And Jesus said to them
 \u201cYou will all fall away; for it is written
 \u2018I will strike the shepherd
 and the sheep will be scattered.\u2019 ","But after I am raised up
 I will go before you to Galilee.\u201d ","And Jesus said to him
 \u201cTruly
 I say to you
 this very night
 before the cock crows twice
 you will deny me three times.\u201d ","And they went to a place which was called Gethsem\u2032ane; and he said to his disciples
 \u201cSit here
 while I pray.\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cMy soul is very sorrowful
 even to death; remain here
 and watch.\u201d ","And he said
 \u201cAbba
 Father
 all things are possible to thee; remove this cup from me; yet not what I will
 but what thou wilt.\u201d ","And he came and found them sleeping
 and he said to Peter
 \u201cSimon
 are you asleep? Could you not watch one hour? ","Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation; the spirit indeed is willing
 but the flesh is weak.\u201d ","And he came the third time
 and said to them
 \u201cAre you still sleeping and taking your rest? It is enough; the hour has come; the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. ","Rise
 let us be going; see
 my betrayer is at hand.\u201d","And Jesus said to them
 \u201cHave you come out as against a robber
 with swords and clubs to capture me? ","Day after day I was with you in the temple teaching
 and you did not seize me. But let the scriptures be fulfilled.\u201d ","And Jesus said
 \u201cI am; and you will see the Son of man seated at the right hand of Power
 and coming with the clouds of heaven.\u201d ","And some began to spit on him
 and to cover his face
 and to strike him
 saying to him
 \u201cProphesy!\u201d And the guards received him with blows.","And immediately the cock crowed a second time. And Peter remembered how Jesus had said to him
 \u201cBefore the cock crows twice
 you will deny me three times.\u201d And he broke down and wept.","And Pilate asked him
 \u201cAre you the King of the Jews?\u201d And he answered him
 \u201cYou have said so.\u201d ","And he answered them
 \u201cDo you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?\u201d ","And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice
 \u201cE\u2032lo-i
 E\u2032lo-i
 la\u2032ma sabach-tha\u2032ni?\u201d which means
 \u201cMy God
 my God
 why hast thou forsaken me?\u201d ","And when the centurion
 who stood facing him
 saw that he thus breathed his last
 he said
 \u201cTruly this man was the Son of God!\u201d","And Pilate wondered if he were already dead; and summoning the centurion
 he asked him whether he was already dead. ","And they were saying to one another
 \u201cWho will roll away the stone for us from the door of the tomb?\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cDo not be amazed; you seek Jesus of Nazareth
 who was crucified. He has risen
 he is not here; see the place where they laid him. ","And he said to them
 \u201cGo into all the world and preach the gospel to the whole creation. ","He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned.","And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues;","they will pick up serpents
 and if they drink any deadly thing
 it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick
 and they will recover.\u201d","The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ
 the Son of God.","and saying
 \u201cThe time is fulfilled
 and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent
 and believe in the gospel.\u201d","And Jesus said to them
 \u201cFollow me and I will make you become fishers of men.\u201d ","But Jesus rebuked him
 saying
 \u201cBe silent
 and come out of him!\u201d ","and they found him and said to him
 \u201cEvery one is searching for you.\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cLet us go on to the next towns
 that I may preach there also; for that is why I came out.\u201d ","Moved with pity
 he stretched out his hand and touched him
 and said to him
 \u201cI will; be clean.\u201d ","and said to him
 \u201cSee that you say nothing to any one; but go
 show yourself to the priest
 and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded
 for a proof to the people.\u201d ","And when Jesus saw their faith
 he said to the paralytic
 \u201cMy son
 your sins are forgiven.\u201d ","And immediately Jesus
 perceiving in his spirit that they thus questioned within themselves
 said to them
 \u201cWhy do you question thus in your hearts? ","Which is easier
 to say to the paralytic
 \u2018Your sins are forgiven
\u2019 or to say
 \u2018Rise
 take up your pallet and walk\u2019? ","But that you may know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins\u201d\u2014he said to the paralytic\u2014","\u201cI say to you
 rise
 take up your pallet and go home.\u201d ","And as he passed on
 he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax office
 and he said to him
 \u201cFollow me.\u201d And he rose and followed him.","And when Jesus heard it
 he said to them
 \u201cThose who are well have no need of a physician
 but those who are sick; I came not to call the righteous
 but sinners.\u201d","And Jesus said to them
 \u201cCan the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them
 they cannot fast. ","The days will come
 when the bridegroom is taken away from them
 and then they will fast in that day. ","No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; if he does
 the patch tears away from it
 the new from the old
 and a worse tear is made. ","And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; if he does
 the wine will burst the skins
 and the wine is lost
 and so are the skins; but new wine is for fresh skins.\u201d","And the Pharisees said to him
 \u201cLook
 why are they doing what is not lawful on the sabbath?\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cHave you never read what David did
 when he was in need and was hungry
 he and those who were with him: ","And he said to them
 \u201cThe sabbath was made for man
 not man for the sabbath; ","so the Son of man is lord even of the sabbath.\u201d","And he said to the man who had the withered hand
 \u201cCome here.\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cIs it lawful on the sabbath to do good or to do harm
 to save life or to kill?\u201d But they were silent. ","And he looked around at them with anger
 grieved at their hardness of heart
 and said to the man
 \u201cStretch out your hand.\u201d He stretched it out
 and his hand was restored. ","And he called them to him
 and said to them in parables
 \u201cHow can Satan cast out Satan? ","If a kingdom is divided against itself
 that kingdom cannot stand. ","And if a house is divided against itself
 that house will not be able to stand. ","And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided
 he cannot stand
 but is coming to an end. ","But no one can enter a strong man\u2019s house and plunder his goods
 unless he first binds the strong man; then indeed he may plunder his house.","\u201cTruly
 I say to you
 all sins will be forgiven the sons of men
 and whatever blasphemies they utter; ","but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness
 but is guilty of an eternal sin\u201d\u2014 ","And a crowd was sitting about him; and they said to him
 \u201cYour mother and your brethren are outside
 asking for you.\u201d ","And he replied
 \u201cWho are my mother and my brethren?\u201d ","And looking around on those who sat about him
 he said
 \u201cHere are my mother and my brethren! ","Whoever does the will of God is my brother
 and sister
 and mother.\u201d","And he taught them many things in parables
 and in his teaching he said to them: ","\u201cListen! A sower went out to sow.","And as he sowed
 some seed fell along the path
 and the birds came and devoured it. ","Other seed fell on rocky ground
 where it had not much soil
 and immediately it sprang up
 since it had no depth of soil; ","and when the sun rose it was scorched
 and since it had no root it withered away. ","Other seed fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked it
 and it yielded no grain. ","And other seeds fell into good soil and brought forth grain
 growing up and increasing and yielding thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold.\u201d ","And he said
 \u201cHe who has ears to hear
 let him hear.\u201d","And he said to them
 \u201cTo you has been given the secret of the kingdom of God
 but for those outside everything is in parables; ","so that they may indeed see but not perceive
 and may indeed hear but not understand; lest they should turn again
 and be forgiven.\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cDo you not understand this parable? How then will you understand all the parables? ","The sower sows the word.","And these are the ones along the path
 where the word is sown; when they hear
 Satan immediately comes and takes away the word which is sown in them. ","And these in like manner are the ones sown upon rocky ground
 who
 when they hear the word
 immediately receive it with joy; ","and they have no root in themselves
 but endure for a while; then
 when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word
 immediately they fall away. ","And others are the ones sown among thorns; they are those who hear the word
 ","but the cares of the world
 and the delight in riches
 and the desire for other things
 enter in and choke the word
 and it proves unfruitful. ","But those that were sown upon the good soil are the ones who hear the word and accept it and bear fruit
 thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold.\u201d","And he said to them
 \u201cIs a lamp brought in to be put under a bushel
 or under a bed
 and not on a stand? ","For there is nothing hid
 except to be made manifest; nor is anything secret
 except to come to light. ","If any man has ears to hear
 let him hear.\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cTake heed what you hear; the measure you give will be the measure you get
 and still more will be given you. ","For to him who has will more be given; and from him who has not
 even what he has will be taken away.\u201d","And he said
 \u201cThe kingdom of God is as if a man should scatter seed upon the ground
 ","and should sleep and rise night and day
 and the seed should sprout and grow
 he knows not how. ","The earth produces of itself
 first the blade
 then the ear
 then the full grain in the ear. ","But when the grain is ripe
 at once he puts in the sickle
 because the harvest has come.\u201d","And he said
 \u201cWith what can we compare the kingdom of God
 or what parable shall we use for it? ","It is like a grain of mustard seed
 which
 when sown upon the ground
 is the smallest of all the seeds on earth; ","yet when it is sown it grows up and becomes the greatest of all shrubs
 and puts forth large branches
 so that the birds of the air can make nests in its shade.\u201d","On that day
 when evening had come
 he said to them
 \u201cLet us go across to the other side.\u201d ","And he awoke and rebuked the wind
 and said to the sea
 \u201cPeace! Be still!\u201d And the wind ceased
 and there was a great calm. ","He said to them
 \u201cWhy are you afraid? Have you no faith?\u201d ","For he had said to him
 \u201cCome out of the man
 you unclean spirit!\u201d ","And Jesus asked him
 \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d He replied
 \u201cMy name is Legion; for we are many.\u201d ","But he refused
 and said to him
 \u201cGo home to your friends
 and tell them how much the Lord has done for you
 and how he has had mercy on you.\u201d ","For she said
 \u201cIf I touch even his garments
 I shall be made well.\u201d ","And his disciples said to him
 \u201cYou see the crowd pressing around you
 and yet you say
 \u2018Who touched me?\u2019\u201d ","And he said to her
 \u201cDaughter
 your faith has made you well; go in peace
 and be healed of your disease.\u201d","But ignoring what they said
 Jesus said to the ruler of the synagogue
 \u201cDo not fear
 only believe.\u201d ","And when he had entered
 he said to them
 \u201cWhy do you make a tumult and weep? The child is not dead but sleeping.\u201d ","Taking her by the hand he said to her
 \u201cTal\u2032itha cu\u2032mi\u201d; which means
 \u201cLittle girl
 I say to you
 arise.\u201d ","And Jesus said to them
 \u201cA prophet is not without honor
 except in his own country
 and among his own kin
 and in his own house.\u201d ","And he called to him the twelve
 and began to send them out two by two
 and gave them authority over the unclean spirits. ","And he said to them
 \u201cWhere you enter a house
 stay there until you leave the place. ","And if any place will not receive you and they refuse to hear you
 when you leave
 shake off the dust that is on your feet for a testimony against them.\u201d ","But when Herod heard of it he said
 \u201cJohn
 whom I beheaded
 has been raised.\u201d ","For when Hero\u2032di-as\u2019 daughter came in and danced
 she pleased Herod and his guests; and the king said to the girl
 \u201cAsk me for whatever you wish
 and I will grant it.\u201d ","And she went out
 and said to her mother
 \u201cWhat shall I ask?\u201d And she said
 \u201cThe head of John the baptizer.\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cCome away by yourselves to a lonely place
 and rest a while.\u201d For many were coming and going
 and they had no leisure even to eat. ","But he answered them
 \u201cYou give them something to eat.\u201d And they said to him
 \u201cShall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread
 and give it to them to eat?\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cHow many loaves have you? Go and see.\u201d And when they had found out
 they said
 \u201cFive
 and two fish.\u201d ","for they all saw him
 and were terrified. But immediately he spoke to them and said
 \u201cTake heart
 it is I; have no fear.\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cWell did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites
 as it is written
 \u2018This people honors me with their lips
 but their heart is far from me;","in vain do they worship me
 teaching as doctrines the precepts of men.\u2019","You leave the commandment of God
 and hold fast the tradition of men.\u201d","And he said to them
 \u201cYou have a fine way of rejecting the commandment of God
 in order to keep your tradition! ","For Moses said
 \u2018Honor your father and your mother\u2019; and
 \u2018He who speaks evil of father or mother
 let him surely die\u2019; ","but you say
 \u2018If a man tells his father or his mother
 What you would have gained from me is Corban\u2019 (that is
 given to God)\u2014 ","then you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or mother
 ","thus making void the word of God through your tradition which you hand on. And many such things you do.\u201d","And he called the people to him again
 and said to them
 \u201cHear me
 all of you
 and understand: ","there is nothing outside a man which by going into him can defile him; but the things which come out of a man are what defile him.\u201d","And he said to them
 \u201cThen are you also without understanding? Do you not see that whatever goes into a man from outside cannot defile him
 ","since it enters
 not his heart but his stomach
 and so passes on?\u201d (Thus he declared all foods clean.) ","And he said
 \u201cWhat comes out of a man is what defiles a man. ","For from within
 out of the heart of man
 come evil thoughts
 fornication
 theft
 murder
 adultery
 ","coveting
 wickedness
 deceit
 licentiousness
 envy
 slander
 pride
 foolishness. ","All these evil things come from within
 and they defile a man.\u201d","And he said to her
 \u201cLet the children first be fed
 for it is not right to take the children\u2019s bread and throw it to the dogs.\u201d ","And he said to her
 \u201cFor this saying you may go your way; the demon has left your daughter.\u201d ","and looking up to heaven
 he sighed
 and said to him
 \u201cEph\u2032phatha
\u201d that is
 \u201cBe opened.\u201d ","In those days
 when again a great crowd had gathered
 and they had nothing to eat
 he called his disciples to him
 and said to them
 ","\u201cI have compassion on the crowd
 because they have been with me now three days
 and have nothing to eat; ","and if I send them away hungry to their homes
 they will faint on the way; and some of them have come a long way.\u201d ","And he asked them
 \u201cHow many loaves have you?\u201d They said
 \u201cSeven.\u201d ","And he sighed deeply in his spirit
 and said
 \u201cWhy does this generation seek a sign? Truly
 I say to you
 no sign shall be given to this generation.\u201d ","And he cautioned them
 saying
 \u201cTake heed
 beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.\u201d ","And being aware of it
 Jesus said to them
 \u201cWhy do you discuss the fact that you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive or understand? Are your hearts hardened? ","Having eyes do you not see
 and having ears do you not hear? And do you not remember? ","When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand
 how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?\u201d They said to him
 \u201cTwelve.\u201d ","\u201cAnd the seven for the four thousand
 how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?\u201d And they said to him
 \u201cSeven.\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cDo you not yet understand?\u201d","And he took the blind man by the hand
 and led him out of the village; and when he had spit on his eyes and laid his hands upon him
 he asked him
 \u201cDo you see anything?\u201d ","And he sent him away to his home
 saying
 \u201cDo not even enter the village.\u201d","And Jesus went on with his disciples
 to the villages of Caesare\u2032a Philippi; and on the way he asked his disciples
 \u201cWho do men say that I am?\u201d ","And he asked them
 \u201cBut who do you say that I am?\u201d Peter answered him
 \u201cYou are the Christ.\u201d ","But turning and seeing his disciples
 he rebuked Peter
 and said
 \u201cGet behind me
 Satan! For you are not on the side of God
 but of men.\u201d","And he called to him the multitude with his disciples
 and said to them
 \u201cIf any man would come after me
 let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. ","For whoever would save his life will lose it; and whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospel\u2019s will save it.","For what does it profit a man
 to gain the whole world and forfeit his life? ","For what can a man give in return for his life?","For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation
 of him will the Son of man also be ashamed
 when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cTruly
 I say to you
 there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God come with power.\u201d","And Peter said to Jesus
 \u201cMaster
 it is well that we are here; let us make three booths
 one for you and one for Moses and one for Eli\u2032jah.\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cEli\u2032jah does come first to restore all things; and how is it written of the Son of man
 that he should suffer many things and be treated with contempt? ","But I tell you that Eli\u2032jah has come
 and they did to him whatever they pleased
 as it is written of him.\u201d","And he asked them
 \u201cWhat are you discussing with them?\u201d ","And he answered them
 \u201cO faithless generation
 how long am I to be with you? How long am I to bear with you? Bring him to me.\u201d ","And Jesus asked his father
 \u201cHow long has he had this?\u201d And he said
 \u201cFrom childhood. ","And Jesus said to him
 \u201cIf you can! All things are possible to him who believes.\u201d ","And when Jesus saw that a crowd came running together
 he rebuked the unclean spirit
 saying to it
 \u201cYou dumb and deaf spirit
 I command you
 come out of him
 and never enter him again.\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cThis kind cannot be driven out by anything but prayer and fasting.\u201d","for he was teaching his disciples
 saying to them
 \u201cThe Son of man will be delivered into the hands of men
 and they will kill him; and when he is killed
 after three days he will rise.\u201d ","And they came to Caper\u2032na-um; and when he was in the house he asked them
 \u201cWhat were you discussing on the way?\u201d ","And he sat down and called the twelve; and he said to them
 \u201cIf any one would be first
 he must be last of all and servant of all.\u201d ","And he took a child
 and put him in the midst of them; and taking him in his arms
 he said to them
 ","But Jesus said
 \u201cDo not forbid him; for no one who does a mighty work in my name will be able soon after to speak evil of me. ","For he that is not against us is for us.","For truly
 I say to you
 whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you bear the name of Christ
 will by no means lose his reward.","\u201cWhoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin
 it would be better for him if a great millstone were hung round his neck and he were thrown into the sea. ","And if your hand causes you to sin
 cut it off; it is better for you to enter life maimed than with two hands to go to hell
 to the unquenchable fire. ","And if your foot causes you to sin
 cut it off; it is better for you to enter life lame than with two feet to be thrown into hell. ","And if your eye causes you to sin
 pluck it out; it is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into hell
 ","where their worm does not die
 and the fire is not quenched. ","For every one will be salted with fire.","Salt is good; but if the salt has lost its saltness
 how will you season it? Have salt in yourselves
 and be at peace with one another.\u201d","He answered them
 \u201cWhat did Moses command you?\u201d ","But Jesus said to them
 \u201cFor your hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment. ","But from the beginning of creation
 \u2018God made them male and female.\u2019 ","\u2018For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife
 ","and the two shall become one.\u2019 So they are no longer two but one.","What therefore God has joined together
 let not man put asunder.\u201d","And he said to them
 \u201cWhoever divorces his wife and marries another
 commits adultery against her; ","and if she divorces her husband and marries another
 she commits adultery.\u201d","But when Jesus saw it he was indignant
 and said to them
 \u201cLet the children come to me
 do not hinder them; for to such belongs the kingdom of God. ","Truly
 I say to you
 whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it.\u201d ","And Jesus said to him
 \u201cWhy do you call me good? No one is good but God alone. ","You know the commandments: \u2018Do not kill
 Do not commit adultery
 Do not steal
 Do not bear false witness
 Do not defraud
 Honor your father and mother.\u2019\u201d ","And he said to him
 \u201cTeacher
 all these I have observed from my youth.\u201d ","And Jesus looking upon him loved him
 and said to him
 \u201cYou lack one thing; go
 sell what you have
 and give to the poor
 and you will have treasure in heaven; and come
 follow me.\u201d ","And Jesus looked around and said to his disciples
 \u201cHow hard it will be for those who have riches to enter the kingdom of God!\u201d ","And the disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said to them again
 \u201cChildren
 how hard it is for those who trust in riches to enter the kingdom of God! ","It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.\u201d","And they were exceedingly astonished
 and said to him
 \u201cThen who can be saved?\u201d ","Jesus looked at them and said
 \u201cWith men it is impossible
 but not with God; for all things are possible with God.\u201d ","Jesus said
 \u201cTruly
 I say to you
 there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or lands
 for my sake and for the gospel
 ","who will not receive a hundredfold now in this time
 houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands
 with persecutions
 and in the age to come eternal life. ","But many that are first will be last
 and the last first.\u201d","saying
 \u201cBehold
 we are going up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes
 and they will condemn him to death
 and deliver him to the Gentiles; ","and they will mock him
 and spit upon him
 and scourge him
 and kill him; and after three days he will rise.\u201d","And James and John
 the sons of Zeb\u2032edee
 came forward to him
 and said to him
 \u201cTeacher
 we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you.\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cWhat do you want me to do for you?\u201d ","But Jesus said to them
 \u201cYou do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink
 or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?\u201d ","And they said to him
 \u201cWe are able.\u201d And Jesus said to them
 \u201cThe cup that I drink you will drink; and with the baptism with which I am baptized
 you will be baptized; ","but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant
 but it is for those for whom it has been prepared.\u201d ","And Jesus called them to him and said to them
 \u201cYou know that those who are supposed to rule over the Gentiles lord it over them
 and their great men exercise authority over them. ","But it shall not be so among you; but whoever would be great among you must be your servant
 ","and whoever would be first among you must be slave of all.","For the Son of man also came not to be served but to serve
 and to give his life as a ransom for many.\u201d","And Jesus stopped and said
 \u201cCall him.\u201d And they called the blind man
 saying to him
 \u201cTake heart; rise
 he is calling you.\u201d ","And Jesus said to him
 \u201cWhat do you want me to do for you?\u201d And the blind man said to him
 \u201cMaster
 let me receive my sight.\u201d ","And Jesus said to him
 \u201cGo your way; your faith has made you well.\u201d And immediately he received his sight and followed him on the way.","and said to them
 \u201cGo into the village opposite you
 and immediately as you enter it you will find a colt tied
 on which no one has ever sat; untie it and bring it. ","If any one says to you
 \u2018Why are you doing this?\u2019 say
 \u2018The Lord has need of it and will send it back here immediately.\u2019\u201d ","And he said to it
 \u201cMay no one ever eat fruit from you again.\u201d And his disciples heard it.","And he taught
 and said to them
 \u201cIs it not written
 \u2018My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations\u2019? But you have made it a den of robbers.\u201d ","And Jesus answered them
 \u201cHave faith in God. ","Truly
 I say to you
 whoever says to this mountain
 \u2018Be taken up and cast into the sea
\u2019 and does not doubt in his heart
 but believes that what he says will come to pass

 whatever you ask in prayer
 believe that you receive it
 and you will. ","And whenever you stand praying
 forgive
 if you have anything against any one; so that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cI will ask you a question; answer me
 and I will tell you by what authority I do these things. ","Was the baptism of John from heaven or from men? Answer me.\u201d","So they answered Jesus
 \u201cWe do not know.\u201d And Jesus said to them
 \u201cNeither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.\u201d","And he began to speak to them in parables. \u201cA man planted a vineyard
 and set a hedge around it
 and dug a pit for the wine press
 and built a tower
 and let it out to tenants
 and went into another country. ","When the time came
 he sent a servant to the tenants
 to get from them some of the fruit of the vineyard. ","And they took him and beat him
 and sent him away empty-handed. ","Again he sent to them another servant
 and they wounded him in the head
 and treated him shamefully. ","And he sent another
 and him they killed; and so with many others
 some they beat and some they killed. ","He had still one other
 a beloved son; finally he sent him to them
 saying
 \u2018They will respect my son.\u2019 ","But those tenants said to one another
 \u2018This is the heir; come
 let us kill him
 and the inheritance will be ours.\u2019 ","And they took him and killed him
 and cast him out of the vineyard. ","What will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the tenants
 and give the vineyard to others. ","Have you not read this scripture: \u2018The very stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner;","this was the Lord\u2019s doing
 and it is marvelous in our eyes\u2019?\u201d","And they sent to him some of the Pharisees and some of the Hero\u2032di-ans
 to entrap him in his talk. ","Should we pay them
 or should we not?\u201d But knowing their hypocrisy
 he said to them
 \u201cWhy put me to the test? Bring me a coin
 and let me look at it.\u201d ","And they brought one. And he said to them
 \u201cWhose likeness and inscription is this?\u201d They said to him
 \u201cCaesar\u2019s.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cRender to Caesar the things that are Caesar\u2019s
 and to God the things that are God\u2019s.\u201d And they were amazed at him.","Jesus said to them
 \u201cIs not this why you are wrong
 that you know neither the scriptures nor the power of God? ","For when they rise from the dead
 they neither marry nor are given in marriage
 but are like angels in heaven. ","And as for the dead being raised
 have you not read in the book of Moses
 in the passage about the bush
 how God said to him
 \u2018I am the God of Abraham
 and the God of Isaac
 and the God of Jacob\u2019? ","He is not God of the dead
 but of the living; you are quite wrong.\u201d","And one of the scribes came up and heard them disputing with one another
 and seeing that he answered them well
 asked him
 \u201cWhich commandment is the first of all?\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cThe first is
 \u2018Hear
 O Israel: The Lord our God
 the Lord is one; ","and you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart
 and with all your soul
 and with all your mind
 and with all your strength.\u2019 ","The second is this
 \u2018You shall love your neighbor as yourself.\u2019 There is no other commandment greater than these.\u201d ","And when Jesus saw that he answered wisely
 he said to him
 \u201cYou are not far from the kingdom of God.\u201d And after that no one dared to ask him any question.","And as Jesus taught in the temple
 he said
 \u201cHow can the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David? ","David himself
 inspired by the Holy Spirit
 declared
 \u2018The Lord said to my Lord
 Sit at my right hand
 till I put thy enemies under thy feet.\u2019","David himself calls him Lord; so how is he his son?\u201d And the great throng heard him gladly.","And in his teaching he said
 \u201cBeware of the scribes
 who like to go about in long robes
 and to have salutations in the market places ","and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at feasts
 ","who devour widows\u2019 houses and for a pretense make long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation.\u201d","And he called his disciples to him
 and said to them
 \u201cTruly
 I say to you
 this poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the treasury. ","For they all contributed out of their abundance; but she out of her poverty has put in everything she had
 her whole living.\u201d","And as he came out of the temple
 one of his disciples said to him
 \u201cLook
 Teacher
 what wonderful stones and what wonderful buildings!\u201d ","And Jesus said to him
 \u201cDo you see these great buildings? There will not be left here one stone upon another
 that will not be thrown down.\u201d","And Jesus began to say to them
 \u201cTake heed that no one leads you astray. ","Many will come in my name
 saying
 \u2018I am he!\u2019 and they will lead many astray. ","And when you hear of wars and rumors of wars
 do not be alarmed; this must take place
 but the end is not yet. ","For nation will rise against nation
 and kingdom against kingdom; there will be earthquakes in various places
 there will be famines; this is but the beginning of the sufferings.","\u201cBut take heed to yourselves; for they will deliver you up to councils; and you will be beaten in synagogues; and you will stand before governors and kings for my sake
 to bear testimony before them. ","And the gospel must first be preached to all nations.","And when they bring you to trial and deliver you up
 do not be anxious beforehand what you are to say; but say whatever is given you in that hour
 for it is not you who speak
 but the Holy Spirit. ","And brother will deliver up brother to death
 and the father his child
 and children will rise against parents and have them put to death; ","and you will be hated by all for my name\u2019s sake. But he who endures to the end will be saved.","\u201cBut when you see the desolating sacrilege set up where it ought not to be (let the reader understand)
 then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains; ","let him who is on the housetop not go down
 nor enter his house
 to take anything away; ","and let him who is in the field not turn back to take his mantle.","And alas for those who are with child and for those who give suck in those days!","Pray that it may not happen in winter.","For in those days there will be such tribulation as has not been from the beginning of the creation which God created until now
 and never will be. ","And if the Lord had not shortened the days
 no human being would be saved; but for the sake of the elect
 whom he chose
 he shortened the days. ","And then if any one says to you
 \u2018Look
 here is the Christ!\u2019 or \u2018Look
 there he is!\u2019 do not believe it. ","False Christs and false prophets will arise and show signs and wonders
 to lead astray
 if possible
 the elect. ","But take heed; I have told you all things beforehand.","\u201cBut in those days
 after that tribulation
 the sun will be darkened
 and the moon will not give its light
 ","and the stars will be falling from heaven
 and the powers in the heavens will be shaken. ","And then they will see the Son of man coming in clouds with great power and glory.","And then he will send out the angels
 and gather his elect from the four winds
 from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven.","\u201cFrom the fig tree learn its lesson: as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts forth its leaves
 you know that summer is near. ","So also
 when you see these things taking place
 you know that he is near
 at the very gates. ","Truly
 I say to you
 this generation will not pass away before all these things take place. ","Heaven and earth will pass away
 but my words will not pass away.","\u201cBut of that day or that hour no one knows
 not even the angels in heaven
 nor the Son
 but only the Father. ","Take heed
 watch and pray; for you do not know when the time will come. ","It is like a man going on a journey
 when he leaves home and puts his servants in charge
 each with his work
 and commands the doorkeeper to be on the watch. ","Watch therefore\u2014for you do not know when the master of the house will come
 in the evening
 or at midnight
 or at cockcrow
 or in the morning\u2014 ","lest he come suddenly and find you asleep.","And what I say to you I say to all: Watch.\u201d","But there were some who said to themselves indignantly
 \u201cWhy was the ointment thus wasted? ","But Jesus said
 \u201cLet her alone; why do you trouble her? She has done a beautiful thing to me. ","For you always have the poor with you
 and whenever you will
 you can do good to them; but you will not always have me. ","She has done what she could; she has anointed my body beforehand for burying.","And truly
 I say to you
 wherever the gospel is preached in the whole world
 what she has done will be told in memory of her.\u201d","And he sent two of his disciples
 and said to them
 \u201cGo into the city

 \u2018The Teacher says
 Where is my guest room
 where I am to eat the passover with my disciples?\u2019 ","And he will show you a large upper room furnished and ready; there prepare for us.\u201d","And as they were at table eating
 Jesus said
 \u201cTruly
 I say to you
 one of you will betray me
 one who is eating with me.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cIt is one of the twelve
 one who is dipping bread in the same dish with me. ","For the Son of man goes as it is written of him
 but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.\u201d","And as they were eating
 he took bread
 and blessed
 and broke it
 and gave it to them
 and said
 \u201cTake; this is my body.\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cThis is my blood of the covenant

 I say to you
 I shall not drink again of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.\u201d","And Jesus said to them
 \u201cYou will all fall away; for it is written
 \u2018I will strike the shepherd
 and the sheep will be scattered.\u2019 ","But after I am raised up
 I will go before you to Galilee.\u201d ","And Jesus said to him
 \u201cTruly
 I say to you
 this very night
 before the cock crows twice
 you will deny me three times.\u201d ","And they went to a place which was called Gethsem\u2032ane; and he said to his disciples
 \u201cSit here
 while I pray.\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cMy soul is very sorrowful
 even to death; remain here
 and watch.\u201d ","And he said
 \u201cAbba
 Father
 all things are possible to thee; remove this cup from me; yet not what I will

 \u201cAre you still sleeping and taking your rest? It is enough; the hour has come; the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. ","Rise
 let us be going; see
 my betrayer is at hand.\u201d","And Jesus said to them
 \u201cHave you come out as against a robber
 with swords and clubs to capture me? ","Day after day I was with you in the temple teaching
 and you did not seize me. But let the scriptures be fulfilled.\u201d ","And Jesus said
 \u201cI am; and you will see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of Power

 and to cover his face
 and to strike him
 saying to him
 \u201cProphesy!\u201d And the guards received him with blows.","And immediately the cock crowed a second time. And Peter remembered how Jesus had said to him
 \u201cBefore the cock crows twice
 you will deny me three times.\u201d And he broke down and wept.","And Pilate asked him
 \u201cAre you the King of the Jews?\u201d And he answered him
 \u201cYou have said so.\u201d ","And he answered them
 \u201cDo you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?\u201d ","And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice

 \u201cMy God
 my God

 who stood facing him
 saw that he thus breathed his last
 he said
 \u201cTruly this man was the Son of God!\u201d","And Pilate wondered if he were already dead; and summoning the centurion
 he asked him whether he was already dead. ","And they were saying to one another
 \u201cWho will roll away the stone for us from the door of the tomb?\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cDo not be amazed; you seek Jesus of Nazareth

 \u201cGo into all the world and preach the gospel to the whole creation. ","He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned.","And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues;","they will pick up serpents

 \u201cFollow Me
 and I will make you become fishers of men.\u201d","Yeshua rebuked him

 \u201cQuiet! Come out of him!\u201d","And when they found Him

 \u201cEverybody\u2019s looking for You.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cLet\u2019s go somewhere else

 Yeshua stretched out His hand and touched him. He said
 \u201cI am willing. Be cleansed.\u201d","He said to him
 \u201cSee that you say nothing to anyone

 for your cleansing
 offer what Moses commanded
 as a testimony to them.\u201d","Yeshua
 seeing their faith
 said to the paralyzed man
 \u201cSon
 your sins are forgiven.\u201d","Immediately Yeshua
 knowing in His spirit that they were raising questions this way within themselves
 said to them
 \u201cWhy are you questioning these things in your hearts?","Which is easier
 to say to the paralyzed man
 \u2018Your sins are forgiven
\u2019 or to say
 \u2018Get up
 and take your mat and walk\u2019?","But so you may know that the Son of Man has authority to pardon sins on earth.\u00a0.\u00a0..\u201d He tells the paralyzed man
","\u201cI tell you

 He saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector\u2019s booth. He said to him
 \u201cFollow Me.\u201d And he got up and followed Him.","And when He heard this
 Yeshua said to them
 \u201cThose who are healthy have no need for a doctor
 but those who are sick do. I did not come to call the righteous
 but the sinful.\u201d","And Yeshua said to them
 \u201cThe guests of the bridegroom cannot fast while the bridegroom is with them
 can they? As long as they have the bridegroom with them
 they cannot fast.","But the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them
 and then they will fast in that day.","\u201cNo one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. Otherwise the patch pulls away from the old
 and a worse tear happens.","And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise
 the wine will burst the skins; and the wine is lost
 also the skins. But one puts new wine into fresh wineskins.\u201d","The Pharisees were saying to Him
 \u201cLook
 why are they doing what is not permitted on Shabbat?\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cHaven\u2019t you ever read what David did when he was in need
 and he and those with him became hungry?","Then He said to them
 \u201cShabbat was made for man
 and not man for Shabbat.","So the Son of Man is Lord even of Shabbat.\u201d","He said to the man with the withered hand
 \u201cStand up here in the center.\u201d","Then He said to them
 \u201cIs it permitted on Shabbat to do good or to do evil
 to save a life or to kill?\u201d But they kept silent.","After looking around at them with anger
 grieved by their hardness of heart
 He says to the man
 \u201cStretch out your hand.\u201d And he stretched it out
 and his hand was restored.","He called them and began speaking to them in parables: \u201cHow can satan drive out satan?","If a kingdom is divided against itself
 that kingdom cannot stand.","And if a house is divided against itself
 that house will not be able to stand.","And if satan has risen up against himself and is divided
 he cannot stand but his end has come.","\u201cBut no one can enter a strong man\u2019s house to ransack his property

 I tell you
 all things will be forgiven the sons of men

 but is guilty of an eternal sin!\u201d","A crowd was sitting around Him
 and they tell Him
 \u201cLook
 Your mother and Your brothers are outside looking for You.\u201d","Answering them
 He said
 \u201cWho are My mother and My brothers?\u201d","Looking at those sitting in a circle around Him
 He said
 \u201cHere are My mother and My brothers!","For whoever does the will of God
 he is My brother and sister and mother.\u201d","He began teaching them many things by parables
 and in His teaching
 He said to them:","\u201cListen! Behold
 a sower went out to spread some seed.","It happened that as he sowed
 some fell beside the road; and the birds came and ate it up.","\u201cOther seed fell on rocky ground
 where it didn\u2019t have much soil. It sprang up immediately
 because the soil wasn\u2019t deep.","But when the sun came up
 it was scorched; and because it had no root
 it withered away.","\u201cOther seed fell among the thorns; and the thorns grew and choked it
 and it yielded no crop.","\u201cAnd others fell into the good soil and were producing fruit
 springing up and increasing. They yielded a crop
 producing thirty
 sixty
 and a hundredfold.\u201d","And He said
 \u201cHe who has ears to hear
 let him hear.\u201d","And He told them
 \u201cTo you has been given the secret of the kingdom of God. But for those who are outside
 everything is in parables
 so that","\u2018Seeing
 they may se and not perceive
 and hearing
 they may hear and not understand
 so they may not turn back and be forgiven.\u2019\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cDon\u2019t you grasp this parable? Then how will you understand all the parables?","The sower sows the word.","These are the ones beside the road where the word is sown. Whenever they hear
 satan comes quickly and takes away the word that has been sown in them.","\u201cThese are the ones sown on rocky ground. When they hear the word
 immediately they receive it with joy.","And they have no root in themselves but last only a short while. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word
 immediately they fall away.","\u201cAnd others are the ones sown among the thorns. They have heard the word;","but the worries of the world
 the seduction of wealth
 and the desires for other things enter in and choke the word
 and it becomes unfruitful.","\u201cAnd those are the ones sown on the good soil. They hear the word and accept it and produce fruit
 thirty
 sixty
 and a hundredfold.\u201d","He also was saying to them
 \u201cIs a lamp put under a basket or a bed? No
 shouldn\u2019t it be placed on a lampstand?","For there is nothing hidden that will not be revealed
 nor anything kept secret except that it would come to light.","If anyone has ears to hear
 let him hear.\u201d","Then He continued
 \u201cPay attention to what you hear. With the measure you use
 it will be measured to you; and more will be added to you.","For whoever has
 to him more will be given. And whoever does not have
 even what he has will be taken away from him.\u201d","And He was saying
 \u201cThe kingdom of God is like when a man spreads seed on the soil","and falls asleep at night and gets up by day
 and the seed sprouts and grows. He himself doesn\u2019t know how.","Automatically
 the earth brings forth a crop\u2014first the blade
 then the head
 then the full grain in the head.","But when the grain is ready
 at once he sends in the sickle
 for the harvest has come.\u201d","Yeshua also said
 \u201cHow should we picture the kingdom of God? Or by what story shall we present it?","It is like a mustard seed when it\u2019s planted in the ground. Though the smallest of all seeds in the earth
","yet when planted it grows up and becomes the largest of all the herbs. It puts forth big branches
 so the birds of the air can nest in its shade.\u201d","Now on that same day in the evening
 He says to them
 \u201cLet\u2019s cross over to the other side.\u201d","So He woke up and rebuked the wind. And He said to the sea
 \u201cQuiet! Be still!\u201d Then the wind stopped
 and it became totally calm.","And He said to them
 \u201cWhy are you afraid? Even now you have no faith?\u201d","For Yeshua had said to him
 \u201cCome out of the man
 you unclean spirit!\u201d","Then Yeshua began questioning him
 \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d And he answered
 \u201cMy name is Legion
 for we are many.\u201d","Yeshua did not let him
 but He told him
 \u201cGo home to your friends and tell them how much Adonai has done for you
 how He showed you mercy.\u201d","For she kept saying
 \u201cIf I touch even His clothes
 I shall be healed.\u201d","His disciples responded
 \u201cYou see the crowd pressing upon You and you say
 \u2018Who touched Me?\u2019\u201d","And He said to her
 \u201cDaughter
 your faith has made you well. Go in shalom and be healed from your disease.\u201d","But ignoring what they said
 Yeshua tells the synagogue leader
 \u201cDo not be afraid; only believe.\u201d","After entering
 He said to them
 \u201cWhy make such a fuss and weep? The child didn\u2019t die
 but is sleeping.\u201d","Then
 taking hold of the child\u2019s hand
 He tells her
 \u201cTalitha koum
\u201d which means
 \u201cLittle girl
 I say to you
 get up.\u201d","Then Yeshua began saying to them
 \u201cA prophet is not without honor except in his hometown
 among his relatives
 and in his own house.\u201d","Yeshua summoned the Twelve
 and He began to send them out two by two. And He gave them authority over the unclean spirits.","He was also telling them
 \u201cWherever you enter a house
 stay there until you leave that place.","And whatever place will not receive you or listen to you
 as you leave from there
 shake the dust off the bottom of your feet as a witness against them.\u201d","But when Herod heard
 he said
 \u201cJohn
 the one I beheaded
 has been raised!\u201d","When the daughter of Herodias came in and danced
 she pleased Herod and those reclining with him. And the king said to the girl
 \u201cAsk me for whatever you want
 and I\u2019ll give it to you!\u201d","She left the room and said to her mother
 \u201cWhat should I ask for?\u201d Her mother said
 \u201cThe head of John the Immerser!\u201d","There were many coming and going
 and they had no time even to eat. So He said to them
 \u201cCome away by yourselves to an isolated place and rest awhile.\u201d","But He answered and said to them
 \u201cYou give them something to eat!\u201d And they said to Him
 \u201cShould we go and spend two hundred denarii on bread to give them something to eat?\u201d","Then He said to them
 \u201cHow many loaves do you have? Go and see.\u201d When they found out
 they said
 \u201cFive
 and two fish.\u201d","for they all saw Him and were terrified. But immediately
 He spoke to them. He said
 \u201cTake courage! I am. Do not be afraid.\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cRightly did Isaiah prophesy about you hypocrites
 as it is written
 \u2018This people honors Me with their lips but their heart is far from Me.","And in vain they worship Me
 teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.\u2019","Having left behind the commandment of God
 you hold on to the tradition of men.\u201d","He was also telling them
 \u201cYou set aside the commands of God
 in order that you may validate your own tradition.","For Moses said
 \u2018Honor your father and your mother
\u2019 and
 \u2018He who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.\u2019","But you say if anyone tells his father or mother
 \u2018Whatever you might have gained from me is korban (that is
 an offering to God)
\u2019","then you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or mother
","making void the word of God with your tradition that you\u2019ve handed down. And you do many such things.\u201d","Then Yeshua called the crowd again and began saying to them
 \u201cHear Me
 everyone
 and understand.","There is nothing outside the man that can make him unholy by going into him. Rather
 it is what comes out of the man that makes the man unholy.\u201d  (16)","And He said to them
 \u201cAre you then also lacking understanding? Don\u2019t you grasp that whatever goes into the man cannot make him unholy?","For it does not enter into the heart but into the stomach
 and then goes out into the sewer
 cleansing all foods.\u201d","And He continued
 \u201cIt is what comes out of the man that makes the man unholy.","For from within
 out of the heart of men
 come evil intentions
 sexual immorality
 theft
 murder
","adultery
 greed
 wickedness
 deceit
 lustfulness
 envy
 slander
 pride
 and foolishness.","All these evil things come from within and make the man unholy.\u201d","He was telling her
 \u201cFirst let the children get their fill
 for it\u2019s not right to take the children\u2019s bread and throw it to the dogs.\u201d","Then He said to her
 \u201cBecause of this word
 go your way! The demon has left your daughter.\u201d","Looking up to heaven
 He says to the man
 \u201cEphphatha

 there was another large crowd with nothing to eat

","\u201cI have compassion for the crowd
 because they\u2019ve stayed with Me for three days now and have nothing to eat.","If I send them home hungry they\u2019ll pass out on the way

\u201d they said.","Sighing deeply in His spirit
 Yeshua said
 \u201cWhy does this generation demand a sign? Amen
 I tell you
 no sign will be given to this generation.\u201d","Yeshua was warning them
 \u201cWatch out! Beware of the hametz of the Pharisees and the hametz of Herod.\u201d","And Yeshua
 aware of this
 said to them
 \u201cWhy do you discuss that you have no bread? You still don\u2019t get it? Don\u2019t you understand? Are your hearts hardened?","Having eyes
 don\u2019t you see? And having ears
 don\u2019t you hear? And don\u2019t you remember?","When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand
 how many baskets of leftovers did you pick up?\u201d \u201cTwelve
\u201d they say to Him.","\u201cWhen I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand
 how many baskets of leftovers did you pick up?\u201d \u201cSeven
\u201d they say to Him.","He said to them
 \u201cDo you still not understand?\u201d","Taking the blind man by the hand
 Yeshua brought him outside the village. After spitting on the man\u2019s eyes and laying His hands on him
 Yeshua asked the man
 \u201cDo you see anything?\u201d","Yeshua sent him straight home
 saying
 \u201cDon\u2019t even enter the village!\u201d","Now Yeshua and His disciples went out to the villages around Caesarea Philippi. On the way He asked His disciples
 \u201cWho do people say that I am?\u201d","Then He asked them
 \u201cBut who do you say that I am?\u201d Peter answered Him
 \u201cYou are the Messiah!\u201d","But turning around and looking at His disciples
 He rebuked Peter. He said
 \u201cGet behind Me
 satan! You are not setting your mind on the things of God
 but the things of men.\u201d","Then He called the crowd
 along with His disciples
 and said to them
 \u201cIf anyone wants to follow after Me
 he must deny himself
 take up his cross
 and keep following Me.","For whoever wants to save his life will lose it
 but whoever loses his life for My sake and the sake of the Good News will save it.","For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world
 yet forfeit his soul?","For what could a man give in exchange for his soul?","For whoever is ashamed of Me and My words in this unfaithful and sinful generation
 the Son of Man will also be ashamed of him when He comes in the glory of His Father with the holy angels!\u201d","Yeshua was telling them
 \u201cAmen
 I tell you
 there are some standing here who will never taste death until they see the kingdom of God come with power!\u201d","Peter responds to Yeshua
 \u201cRabbi
 it\u2019s good for us to be here. Let\u2019s make three sukkot\u2014one for You

 \u201cIndeed Elijah comes first; he restores all things. And how is it written that the Son of Man must suffer much and be treated with contempt?","I tell you that Elijah has come

 \u201cWhat are you arguing about with them?\u201d","And answering them
 He said
 \u201cOh faithless generation

 \u201cThis kind cannot come out except by prayer.\u201d","for He was teaching His disciples and telling them

 Yeshua says to His disciples

 you will find a colt tied up that no one has ever sat upon. Untie it and bring it.","If anyone says to you
 \u2018Why are you doing this?\u2019 say
 \u2018The Master needs it.\u2019 And right away he will send it back here.\u201d","And He said to it
 \u201cMay no one ever eat fruit from you again!\u201d And His disciples were listening.","And He began to teach them
 saying
 \u201cIs it not written
 \u2018My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations\u2019? But you have made it a \u2018den of thieves.\u2019\u201d","And Yeshua answered
 saying to them
 \u201cHave faith in God!","Amen
 I tell you
 if someone says to this mountain
 \u2018Be taken up and thrown into the sea
\u2019 and does not doubt in his heart but trusts that what he says is happening
 so shall it be for him.","For this reason I say to you
 whatever you pray and ask
 believe that you have received it
 and it will be yours.","Whenever you stand praying
 if you have anything against anyone
 forgive him
 so that your Father in heaven may also forgive you your transgressions.\u201d  (26)","Yeshua said to them
 \u201cI will put one question to you. Answer Me
 and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.","The immersion of John\u2014was it from heaven or from men? Answer Me!\u201d","So answering Yeshua
 they say
 \u201cWe don\u2019t know.\u201d And Yeshua tells them
 \u201cNeither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.\u201d","Yeshua began to speak to them in parables: \u201cA man planted a vineyard. He put a hedge around it
 dug a pit for the winepress
 and built a tower. He leased it to some tenant farmers and went on a journey.","And at the season
 he sent a servant to collect from the tenants part of the vineyard\u2019s fruit.","But grabbing him
 they beat him up and sent him away empty-handed.","And again the man sent another servant to them
 and they wounded his head and treated him shamefully.","He sent another
 and that one they killed; and so on with many others
 beating some and killing some.","He had yet one
 a well-loved son. He sent him to them last of all
 saying
 \u2018They will respect my son.\u2019","\u201cBut those tenants said to one another
 \u2018This is the heir! Come on
 let\u2019s kill him and the inheritance will be ours!\u2019","So grabbing the son
 they killed him and threw him out of the vineyard.","\u201cWhat then will the master of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the tenants and give the vineyard to others.","Haven\u2019t you read this Scripture? \u2018The stone which the builders rejected
 this has become the chief cornerstone.","This came from Adonai
 and it is marvelous in our eyes.\u2019\u201d","Then they send some of the Pharisees and Herodians to Yeshua in order to trap Him with a word.","Should we pay
 or shouldn\u2019t we?\u201d But Yeshua saw through their hypocrisy and said to them
 \u201cWhy are you testing Me? Bring Me a denarius so I may see it.\u201d","They brought one. And He said to them
 \u201cWhose image is this? And whose inscription?\u201d \u201cCaesar\u2019s
\u201d they said to Him.","Then Yeshua said to them
 \u201cGive to Caesar the things that are Caesar\u2019s
 and to God the things that are God\u2019s.\u201d And they were completely amazed at Him.","Yeshua said to them
 \u201cIsn\u2019t this the reason you\u2019ve gone astray
 because you don\u2019t understand the Scriptures or the power of God?","For when they rise up from the dead
 they neither marry nor are given in marriage
 but are like angels in heaven.","But concerning the dead being raised
 haven\u2019t you read in the book of Moses about the burning bush? How God said to him
 \u2018I am the God of Abraham
 and the God of Isaac
 and the God of Jacob\u2019?","He\u2019s not the God of the dead
 but of the living. You have gone far astray!\u201d","One of the Torah scholars came and heard them debating. Seeing that Yeshua had answered them well
 he asked Him
 \u201cWhich commandment is first of all?\u201d","Yeshua answered
 \u201cThe first is
 \u2018Shema Yisrael
 Adonai Eloheinu
 Adonai echad. Hear
 O Israel
 the Lord our God
 the Lord is One.","And you shall love Adonai your God with all your heart
 and with all your soul
 and with all your mind
 and with all your strength.\u2019","The second is this
 \u2018You shall love your neighbor as yourself.\u2019 There is no other commandment greater than these.\u201d","When Yeshua saw that he had answered wisely
 He said to him
 \u201cYou are not far from the kingdom of God.\u201d And no one dared any longer to question Him.","While Yeshua was teaching in the Temple
 He said
 \u201cHow is it that the Torah scholars say that the Messiah is Ben-David?","David himself
 through the Ruach ha-Kodesh
 said
 \u2018Adonai said to my Lord
 \u201cSit at My right hand
 until I put Your enemies under Your feet.\u201d\u2019","If David himself calls Him \u2018Lord
\u2019 in what way is He his son?\u201d And the large crowd was listening to Him with delight.","In His teaching He said
 \u201cWatch out for the Torah scholars
 who like to walk around in long robes. They like greetings in the marketplaces
","the best seats in the synagogues
 and places of honor at feasts.","They devour widows\u2019 houses and make long prayers as a show. These men will receive greater condemnation!\u201d","Calling His disciples over
 He said to them
 \u201cAmen
 I tell you
 this poor widow has put in more than all those contributing to the box!","For they all put in from their surplus; but she
 out of her poverty
 put in everything she had
 her whole living.\u201d","As Yeshua was going out of the Temple
 one of His disciples said to Him
 \u201cTeacher
 look! What stones and what buildings!\u201d","Yeshua said to him
 \u201cYou see these great buildings? Not one stone here will be left upon another. Every one will be torn down!\u201d","Yeshua began to tell them
 \u201cWatch out that no one leads you astray!","Many will come in My name
 saying
 \u2018I am He
\u2019 and they will lead many astray.","When you hear of wars and rumors of wars
 do not be alarmed
 for this must happen but it is not yet the end.","For nation will rise up against nation
 and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places
 and there will be famines. These things are only the beginning of birth pains.","\u201cWatch out for yourselves! They will hand you over to the courts
 and you will be beaten in the synagogues. You will stand before governors and kings because of Me
 as a witness to them.","The Good News must first be proclaimed to all the nations.","When they arrest you and hand you over
 do not worry beforehand about what to say. Say whatever is given to you in that hour
 for it is not you who speaks but the Ruach ha-Kodesh.","Brother will betray brother to death
 and a father his child. And children will rise up against parents and have them put to death.","And you will be hated by all because of My name
 but the one who endures to the end will be saved.\u201d","\u201cBut when you see \u2018the abomination of desolation\u2019 standing where it should not be (let the reader understand)
 then those in Judea must flee to the mountains.","The one on the roof must not go down
 nor enter to take anything out of his house.","And the one in the field must not turn back to get his cloak.","Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days!","Pray that it will not happen in winter.","\u201cFor in those days there will be trouble such as has never happened
 not since the beginning of the creation which God created until now
 and never will.","And unless Adonai had cut short those days
 no one would be saved. But for the sake of the elect
 whom He chose
 He cut short the days.","\u201cAnd then if anyone says to you
 \u2018Look
 here\u2019s the Messiah!\u2019 or
 \u2018Look
 there He is!\u2019 do not believe it.","For false messiahs and false prophets will rise up and show signs and wonders to lead astray
 if possible
 the chosen.","So be careful! See
 I have told you everything beforehand.\u201d","\u201cBut in those days
 after that trouble
 \u2018the sun will be darkened
 and the moon will not give its light
","and the stars will be falling from heaven
 and the powers in the heavens will be shaken.\u2019","And then they will see \u2018the Son of Man coming in clouds\u2019 with great power and glory.","Then He will send out the angels and will gather together His chosen from the four winds
 from the end of the earth
 to the end of heaven.\u201d","\u201cNow learn the parable from the fig tree. When its branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves

 when you see all these things happening
 know that it is near
 at the door.","Amen
 I tell you
 this generation will not pass away until all these things happen.","Heaven and earth will pass away
 but My words will never pass away.","But of that day or hour no one knows
 not even the angels in heaven nor the Son
 except the Father.","\u201cKeep on the lookout! Stay alert! For you do not know when the time is.","It is like a man away on a journey. After leaving his house and putting his servants in charge and giving each his task
 he also commanded the doorkeeper to watch.","Therefore stay alert
 for you do not know when the master of the house is coming
 whether in the evening
 at midnight

 or in the early morning.","So watch in case
 coming suddenly
 he finds you asleep.","What I say to you I say to all: \u2018Stay alert!\u2019\u201d","But some got angry and said among themselves
 \u201cWhy was this fragrant oil wasted?","But Yeshua said
 \u201cLeave her alone. Why do you cause trouble for her? She\u2019s done Me a mitzvah.","For you always have the poor with you

 I tell you

 furnished and ready. Make preparations for us there.\u201d","As they were reclining and eating
 Yeshua said
 \u201cAmen
 I tell you
 one of you who is eating with Me will betray Me.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cIt\u2019s one of the Twelve

 just as it is written about Him; but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born!\u201d","And while they were eating
 He took matzah; and after He offered the bracha

 which is poured out for many.","Amen
 I tell you
 I will never again drink of the fruit of the vine

 \u201cYou will all fall away

 \u2018I will strike the Shepherd
 and the sheep will be scattered.\u2019","But after I\u2019m raised up
 I will go before you to the Galilee.\u201d","And Yeshua said to him
 \u201cAmen
 I tell you
 today\u2014this very night\u2014before a rooster crows twice

 \u201cSit here while I pray.\u201d","And He tells them
 \u201cMy soul is deeply grieved
 even to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch.\u201d","And He was saying

 \u201cAre You the King of the Jews?\u201d Yeshua answers him

 and were troubled]. And at once [And anon] he spake with them
 and said to them
 Trust ye
 I am; do not ye dread. ","And he answered
 and said to them
 Esaias prophesied well of you
 hypocrites
 as it is written
 This people worshippeth me with lips [This people honoureth me with lips]
 but their heart is far from me; ","and in vain they worship me
 teaching the doctrines and the behests of men. [in vain truly they worship me
 teaching the doctrines and commandments of men.] ","For ye leave the commandment of God
 and hold the traditions of men
 as [the] washing of water vessels
 and of cups; and many other things like these ye do. [Forsooth ye forsaking the commandment of God
 hold the traditions of men
 washings of cruets
 and cups; and many other things like to these ye do.] ","And he said to them
 Well ye have made the commandment of God void
 to keep your tradition. [And he said to them
 Well ye have made the commandment of God void
 that ye keep your tradition.] ","For Moses said
 Worship thy father and thy mother [Honour thou thy father and thy mother]; and he that curseth father or mother
 die he by death. ","But ye say
 If a man [shall] say to father or mother
 Corban
 that is
 Whatever gift is of me
 it shall profit to thee; ","and over [and further] ye suffer not him [to] do any thing to father or mother
 ","and ye break the word of God by your tradition
 that ye have given[a]; and ye do many [other] such things. ","And he again called the people
 and said to them
 Ye all hear me
 and understand. ","Nothing that is without a man
 that entereth into him
 may defoul him [Nothing without man is entering into him
 that may defoul him]; but those things that come forth of a man
 those it be that defoul a man. ","And he said to them [And he saith to them]
 [So] Ye be unwise also. Understand ye not
 that all thing withoutforth that entereth into a man
 may not defoul him? ","for it hath not entered into his heart
 but into the womb
 and beneath it goeth out
 purging all meats. ","But he said
 The things that go out of a man
 those defoul a man. ","For from within
 of the heart of men come forth evil thoughts
 adulteries
 fornications
 manslayings
 ","thefts
 avarices [covetousness
 or over-hard keeping of goods]
 wickednesses
 guile
 unchastity
 [an] evil eye
 blasphemies [blasphemy]
 pride
 folly. ","All these evils come forth from within
 and defoul a man
 ","And he said to her
 Suffer thou
 that the children be fulfilled first [Suffer thou
 that the sons be filled first]; for it is not good to take the bread of children
 and give [it] to hounds. ","And Jesus said to her
 Go thou
 for this word the fiend went out of thy daughter.[b] ","And he beheld into heaven
 and sorrowed within
 and said [And he beholding into heaven
 sorrowed within
 and saith to him]
 Ephphatha
 that is
 Be thou opened. ","In those days
 when much people [when much company of people] was with Jesus
 and had not what they should eat
 when his disciples were called together
 he said to them [he saith to them]
 ","I have ruth on the people
 for lo! now the third day they abide me
 and they have not what to eat; [I have ruth on the company of people
 for lo! now by three days they sustain
 or abide
 me
 and have not what they shall eat;] ","and if I let them go [and if I leave them] fasting into their houses
 they shall fail in the way; for some of them came from far. ","And he asked them
 How many loaves have ye? Which said
 Seven. ","And he sorrowing within in spirit
 said
 What seeketh this generation a token? Truly I say to you
 a token shall not be given to this generation.[b]","And he commanded them
 and said [saying]
 See ye
 and beware of the sourdough of the Pharisees
 and of the sourdough of Herod. ","And when this thing was known
 Jesus said to them
 What think ye
 for ye have not loaves [Jesus saith to them
 What think ye
 for ye have not bread]? Yet ye know not
 neither understand; yet ye have your heart blinded. ","Ye having eyes
 see not
 and ye having ears
 hear not; neither ye have mind
 ","when I brake five loaves among five thousand
 and how many baskets [how many coffins] full of broken meat took ye up? They say to him
 Twelve. ","When also seven loaves among four thousand of men
 how many baskets [full] of broken meat took ye up? And they say to him
 Seven.[c] ","And he said to them
 How understand ye not yet? ","And when he had taken the blind man's hand
 he led him out of the street
 and he spat into his eyes
 and set [put] his hands on him; and he asked him [he asked him]
 if he saw any thing. ","And he sent him into his house
 and said [saying]
 Go into thine house; and if thou goest into the street
 say to no man. ","And Jesus entered [in] and his disciples into the castles of Caesarea of Philippi. And in the way he asked his disciples
 and said to them [saying to them]
 Whom say men that I am? ","Then he saith to them
 But whom say ye that I am? Peter answered
 and said to him [Peter answering
 saith to him]
 Thou art Christ. ","And he turned
 and saw his disciples
 and menaced Peter
 and said [saying]
 Go after me
 [thou] Satan; for thou savourest not those things [for thou understandest not those things] that be of God
 but those things that be of men. ","And when the people was called together
 with his disciples
 he said to them
 If any man will come after me
 deny he himself
 and take his cross
 and follow he me [deny he himself
 and take his cross
 and follow me]. ","For he that will make safe his life
 shall lose it; and he that loseth his life for me
 and for the gospel
 shall make it safe. [Soothly who so will make his soul
 that is
 his life
 safe
 he shall lose it; forsooth he that shall lose his soul
 that is
 his life
 for me and the gospel
 shall make it safe.] ","For what profiteth it to a man[e]
 if he win all the world
 and do impairing to his [own] soul? ","or what (ex)changing shall a man give for his soul?","But who that acknowledgeth me [Forsooth who that shall acknowledge me] and my words in this generation adulterous and sinful
 also man's Son shall acknowledge him
 when he shall come in the glory of his Father
 with his angels. ","And he said to them
 Truly I say to you
 that there be some men standing here
 which shall not taste death[a]
 till they see the realm of God coming in virtue.","And Peter answered
 and said to Jesus
 Master it is good us to be here [it good us for to be here]; and make we here three tabernacles
 one to thee
 one to Moses

 and said to them
 When Elias cometh
 he shall first restore all things [When Elias shall come first
 he shall restore all things]; and as it is written of man's Son [and how it is written of man's Son]
 that he suffer many things
 and be despised. ","And I say to you [But I say to you]
 that [also] Elias is come
 and they did to him whatever things they would
 as it is written of him. ","And he asked them
 What dispute ye among you [What seek ye among you]? ","And he answered to them
 and said
 A! thou generation out of belief[c]
 how long shall I be among you
 how long shall I suffer you? Bring ye him to me. ","And he asked his father
 How long is it
 since this hath befallen to him [How much time is it
 since this thing befelled to him]? And he said
 From childhood; ","And Jesus said to him
 If thou mayest believe
 all things be possible to a man that believeth. ","And when Jesus had seen the people running together
 he menaced the unclean spirit
 and said to him [saying to him]
 Thou deaf and dumb spirit
 I command thee
 go out from him
 and enter no more into him. ","And he said to them
 This kind in nothing may go out [This kind may not go out in any thing]
 but in prayer and fasting. ","And he taught his disciples
 and said to them
 For man's Son shall be betrayed into the hands of men
 and they shall slay him

 he asked them
 What treated ye in the way? ","And he sat
 and called the twelve

 If any man will be the first among you
 he shall be the last of all

 or servant
 of all]. ","And he took a child
 and set him in the middle of them [in the midst of them]; and when he had embraced him

 ","And Jesus said
 Do not ye forbid him; for there is no man that doeth a work of power in my name [that doeth virtue in my name]

 he shall not lose his meed. ","And whoever shall cause to stumble one of these little that believe in me

 and said to them
 What commanded Moses to you? ","And Jesus answered
 and said to them
 For the hardness of your heart Moses wrote to you this commandment[b]. ","But from the beginning of creature God made them male and female;","and said
 For this thing a man shall leave his father and mother
 and shall draw to his wife [and shall cleave to his wife]

 but one flesh. [and they shall be two in one flesh. And so now they be not two
 but one flesh.] ","Therefore that thing that God hath joined together

 Whoever shall leave his wife

 Suffer ye little children to come to me
 and forbid ye them not

 whoever receiveth not the kingdom of God as a little child [whoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child]

 What sayest thou
 that I am good? There is no man good
 but God himself.[d] ","Thou knowest the commandments
 do thou none adultery
 slay not
 steal not

 and said to him
 Master
 I have kept all these things from my youth. ","And Jesus beheld him
 and loved him [Soothly Jesus beholding him loved him]
 and said to him
 One thing faileth to thee; go thou
 and sell all things that thou hast [sell whatever things thou hast]
 and give to poor men

 [and] follow thou me. ","And Jesus beheld about
 and said to his disciples [And Jesus beholding about
 saith to his disciples]
 How hard they that have riches shall enter into the kingdom of God. ","And the disciples were astonished in his words. And Jesus again answered
 and said to them
 Ye little children
 how hard it is for men that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God[e]. ","It is lighter a camel to pass through a needle's eye
 than a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. [It is easier that a camel pass through a needle's eye
 than that a rich man enter into the realm of God.]","And they wondered more
 and said among themselves [saying at themselves]
 And who may be saved? ","And Jesus beheld them
 and said [And Jesus beholding them
 saith to them]
 With men it is impossible
 but not with God; for all things be possible with God. ","Jesus answered
 and said
 Truly I say to you
 there is no man that leaveth house
 or brethren

 the first the last
 and the last the first. ","For lo! we ascend to Jerusalem

 and they shall take him [and they shall betake him] to heathen men. ","And they shall scorn him
 and [they shall] bespit him
 and [they shall] beat him; and they shall slay him

 Zebedee's sons
 came to him
 and said [saying]
 Master
 we will

 thou do to us. ","And he said to them
 What will ye that I do to you? ","And Jesus said to them
 Ye know not what ye ask; be ye able to drink the cup
 which I shall drink[f]
 or be washed with the baptism
 in which I am baptized? ","And they said to him
 We be able. And Jesus said to them
 [Truly] Ye shall drink the cup that I drink
 and ye shall be washed with the baptism
 in which I am baptized; ","but to sit at my right half or left half is not mine to give to you
 but to whom it is made ready. ","But Jesus called them
 and said to them
 Ye know
 that they that seem to have princehood of folks
 be lords of them [Soothly Jesus calling them
 saith to them
 Ye know
 that they that seem
 or be seen
 to have princehood on folks
 lordship

 of them]
 and the princes of them have power of them. ","But it is not so among you
 but whoever will be made [the] greater
 shall be your minister; ","and whoever will be the first among you
 shall be servant of all. ","For why man's Son came not
 that it should be ministered to him
 but that he should minister
 and give his life again-buying for many [and give his life redemption
 or again-buying
 for many]. ","And Jesus stood
 and commanded him to be called; and they called the blind man
 and said to him [and they call the blind man
 saying to him]
 Be thou of better heart
 rise up

 and said to him
 What wilt thou
 that I shall do to thee? The blind man said to him
 Master
 that I see. ","Jesus said to him
 Go thou
 thy faith hath made thee safe. And at once [And anon] he saw
 and followed him in the way.","and saith to them
 Go ye into the castle that is against you; and at once as ye enter there ye shall find a colt tied
 on which no man hath sat yet[b]; untie ye
 and bring him. ","And if any man say any thing to you
 What do ye? say ye
 that he is needful to the Lord
 and at once he shall let him go hither [and anon he shall leave him hither]. ","And Jesus answered and said to it
 Now never eat any man fruit of thee more [Now no more without end any man eat fruit of thee]. And his disciples heard; ","And he taught them
 and said
 Whether it is not written
 That mine house shall be called the house of praying to all folks[h]? but ye have made it a den of thieves. ","And Jesus answered and said to them
 Have ye the faith of God; ","truly I say to you
 that whoever saith to this hill
 Be thou taken
 and [be thou] cast into the sea; and doubt not in his heart
 but believeth
 that whatever he say [but believeth
 for whatever thing he saith]

 it shall be done to him. ","Therefore I say to you
 all things whatever things ye praying shall ask
 believe ye that ye shall take
 and they shall come to you. ","And when ye shall stand to pray
 forgive ye
 if ye have any thing against any man

 forgive to you your sins. ","Jesus answered and said to them
 And I shall ask [of] you one word
 and answer ye to me
 and I shall say to you in what power I do these things. ","Whether was the baptism of John of heaven
 or of men? answer ye to me. ","And they answered
 and said to Jesus
 We know not. And Jesus answered
 and said to them [And Jesus answering saith to them]
 Neither I say to you
 in what power I do these things.","And Jesus began to speak to them in parables. A man planted a vineyard
 and set an hedge about it
 and delved a lake
 and builded a tower [and built a tower]
 and hired it to earth-tillers
 and went forth in pilgrimage. ","And he sent to the earth-tillers in time a servant
 to receive of the earth-tillers of the fruit of the vineyard.[a] ","And they took him
 and beat him
 and let him go void [and left him void]. ","And again he sent to them another servant
 and they wounded him in the head
 and tormented him [and punished him with chidings
 or reprovings].","And again he sent another
 and they slew him
 and others more
 beating some
 and slaying others. [And again he sent another
 and they killed him
 and others more
 and they beat some
 soothly they killed others.] ","But yet he had a most dear-worthy son
 and he sent him last to them
 and said [Therefore yet he having one son most dear-worthy
 and to them he sent him the last
 saying]
 Peradventure they shall dread [with reverence] my son. ","But the earth-tillers said together [said to themselves]
 This is the heir; come ye
 slay we him
 and the heritage shall be ours. ","And they took him
 and killed him
 and casted [cast] him out without the vineyard. ","Then what shall the lord of the vineyard do [What therefore shall the lord of the vinery do]? He shall come
 and destroy [and lose] the earth-tillers
 and give the vineyard to others. ","Whether ye have not read this scripture
 The stone which the builders have despised
 this is made into the head of the corner? ","This thing is done of the Lord
 and it is wonderful in our eyes. ","And they sent to him [And they send to him] some of the Pharisees and of the Herodians
 to take him in word. ","Which witting their privy falseness
 said to them
 What tempt ye me [What tempt ye me
 hypocrites]? bring ye to me a penny
 that I [may] see. ","And they brought to him. And he said to them [And he saith to them]
 Whose is this image
 and the writing above? And they say to him
 The emperor's [They say to him
 Caesar's]. ","And Jesus answered and said to them
 Then yield ye to the emperor those things that be the emperor's; and to God those things that be of God. And they wondered of him. [Forsooth Jesus answering said to them
 Therefore yield ye to Caesar those things that be of Caesar

 those things that be of God. And they wondered on him.] ","And Jesus answered
 and said to them
 Whether ye err not therefore
 that ye know not [the] scriptures
 neither the virtue of God?[c]","For when they shall rise again from death
 neither they shall wed
 nor shall be wedded
 but they shall be as angels of God in heavens.[d] ","And of dead men
 that they rise again
 have ye not read in the book of Moses
 on [upon] the bush

 I am God of Abraham

 but [God] of living men; therefore ye err much. ","And one of the scribes
 that had heard them disputing together
 came nigh
 and saw that Jesus had well-answered them
 and asked him[e]
 which was the first commandment of all. ","And Jesus answered to him
 That the first commandment of all is
 Hear thou
 Israel
 thy Lord God is one God;[f] ","and thou shalt love thy Lord God of all thine heart
 and of all thy soul
 and of all thy mind
 and of all thy might [and thou shalt love the Lord thy God of all thine heart
 and of all thy soul
 and of all thy mind
 and of all thy virtue
 or strength]. This is the first commandment. ","And the second is like to this
 Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these. ","And Jesus seeing that he had answered wisely
 said to him
 Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And then no man durst ask him more any thing [And now no man durst ask him more]. ","And Jesus answered and said
 teaching in the temple
 How say [the] scribes
 that Christ is the son of David? ","For David himself said in the Holy Ghost
 the Lord said to my Lord
 Sit [thou] on my right half
 till I put thine enemies the stool of thy feet. [Forsooth David himself said in the Holy Ghost
 The Lord said to my Lord
 Sit thou on my right half
 till I put thine enemies a stool of thy feet.] ","Then if David himself calleth him Lord
 how then is he his son [Therefore David himself sayeth him Lord
 and whereof is he his son]? And much people gladly heard him. ","And he said to them in his teaching
 Be ye ware of scribes
 that will wander in stoles [that will go in stoles]
 and be saluted in [the] market
 ","and sit in synagogues in the first chairs [and sit in the first chairs in synagogues]
 and in the first sitting places in suppers; ","which devour the houses of widows under [the] colour of long prayer; they shall take the longer doom [these shall take longer doom
 either damnation]. ","And he called together his disciples
 and said to them [and saith to them]
 Truly I say to you
 that this poor widow cast more than all
 that cast into the treasury. ","For all they cast of that thing that they had plenty of; but this of her poverty cast all things that she had
 all her livelode [but this of her mis-ease sent all things that she had
 all her lifelode].","And when he went out of the temple
 one of his disciples said to him
 Master
 behold[a]
 what manner stones
 and what manner buildings. ","And Jesus answered
 and said to him
 Seest thou all these great buildings? there shall not be left a stone on a stone
 which shall not be destroyed.[b] ","And Jesus answered
 and began to say to them
 Look ye
 that no man deceive you; [And Jesus answering began to say to them
 See ye
 that no man deceive you;] ","for many shall come in my name
 saying
 That I am; and they shall deceive many. ","And when ye [shall] hear battles and opinions of battles
 dread ye not; for it behooveth these things to be done
 but not yet at once [anon] is the end [for it behooveth that these things be done
 but the end is not yet]. ","For folk shall rise on [upon] folk
 and realm on [upon] realm
 and earth-movings and hunger shall be by places [and earth-moving shall be by places and hunger]; these things shall be beginnings of sorrows. ","But see ye yourselves
 for they shall take you in councils
 and ye shall be beaten in synagogues; and ye shall stand before kings and doomsmen for me
 in witnessing to them. ","And it behooveth
 that the gospel be first preached among all folk. ","And when they [shall] take you
 and lead you forth
 do not ye before think what ye shall speak
 but speak ye that thing that shall be given to you in that hour; for ye be not the speakers [soothly ye be not speaking]
 but the Holy Ghost. ","For the brother shall betake the brother into death [Forsooth the brother shall betray the brother into death]
 and the father the son
 and sons shall rise together against fathers and mothers
 and [shall] punish them by death. ","And ye shall be in hate to all men for my name; but he that lasteth into the end
 shall be safe.[c] ","But when ye shall see the abomination of discomfort
 standing where it oweth not; he that readeth
 understand; then they that be in Judaea
 flee to the mountains. ","And he that is above in the roof
 come not down into the house
 neither enter he
 to take any thing of his house; ","and he that shall be in the field
 turn not again behind to take his cloak. [and he that shall be in the field
 turn he not again behind for to take his cloth.]","But woe to them that be with child
 and nourishing [and nursing] in those days. ","Therefore pray ye
 that those things be not done in winter. [Therefore pray ye
 that your flying be not done in winter

 which manner were not from the beginning of creature
 which God hath made [which God made]
 till now
 neither shall be. ","And but the Lord had abridged those days
 all flesh had not be safe; but for the chosen which he chose [whom he chose]
 the Lord hath made short the days. ","And then if any man [shall] say to you
 Lo! here is Christ
 lo! there
 believe ye not. ","For false Christs and false prophets shall rise
 and shall give tokens and wonders
 to deceive

 after that tribulation
 the sun shall be made dark
 and the moon shall not give her light
 ","and the stars of heaven shall fall down

 shall be moved. ","And then they shall see man's Son coming in the clouds of heaven
 with great virtue and glory. ","And then he shall send his angels
 and shall gather his chosen from the four winds
 from the highest thing of earth till to the highest thing of heaven [from the lowest thing of earth unto the highest thing of heaven]. ","But of the fig tree learn ye the parable [Forsooth of the fig tree learn ye a parable]. When now his branch is tender

 that it is nigh in the doors. ","Truly I say to you
 that this generation shall not pass away

 wake ye

 in the eventide [in the even]

 I say to all
 Wake ye.","But there were some that bare it heavily within themselves

 Whereto is this loss of ointment made? ","But Jesus said
 Suffer ye her; what be ye heavy to her? she hath wrought a good work in [into] me. ","For evermore ye shall have poor men with you

 and saith to them
 Go ye into the city

 and ate [And them sitting at the meat
 and eating]

 Jesus took bread
 and blessed
 and brake [it]

 Take ye; this is my body [Take; this is my body]. ","And he said to them
 This is my blood of the new testament
 which shall be shed [out] for many. ","Truly I say to you
 for now I shall not drink of this fruit of the vine
 [till] into that day when I shall drink it new in the realm of God. ","And Jesus said to them
 All ye shall be caused to stumble in me in this night [And Jesus saith to them
 All ye shall be offended in me in this night]; for it is written
 I shall smite the shepherd

 I shall go before you into Galilee. ","And Jesus said to him
 Truly I say to thee
 that to day before that the cock in this night crow twice

 bear over from me this cup; but not that I will
 but that thou wilt
 be done.[h] ","And he came
 and found them sleeping. And he said to Peter [And he saith to Peter]
 Simon
 sleepest thou? mightest thou not wake with me one hour? ","Wake ye
 and pray ye
 that ye enter not into temptation; for the spirit is ready
 but the flesh is frail [forsooth the spirit is ready
 but the flesh is sick]. ","And he came the third time
 and said to them [and saith to them]
 Sleep ye now
 and rest ye; it sufficeth. The hour is come; lo! man's Son shall be betrayed into the hands of sinful men [lo! man's son shall be betrayed into the hands of sinners]. ","Rise ye
 go we; lo! he that shall betray me is nigh. ","And Jesus answered
 and said to them
 As to a thief ye have gone out with swords and staves
 to take me? ","Day by day I was among you
 and taught in the temple [Day by day I was at you
 teaching in the temple]
 and ye held not me; but that the scriptures be fulfilled. ","And Jesus said to him
 I am; and ye shall see man's Son sitting on the right half of the virtue of God
 and coming in the clouds of heaven. ","And some began to bespit him
 and to cover his face
 and to smite him with buffets
 and to say to him
 Declare thou [And some began to spit on him
 and to hide his face
 and smite him with buffets
 and say to him
 Prophesy thou]. And the ministers beat him with strokes. ","And at once [And anon] again the cock crew. And Peter bethought on the word that Jesus had said to him
 Before the cock crow twice
 thrice thou shalt deny me [Before that the cock crow twice
 thou shalt deny me thrice]. And he began to weep.","And Pilate asked him
 Art thou king of Jews? And Jesus answered
 and said to him
 Thou sayest [And he answering saith to him
 Thou sayest]. ","And Pilate answered to them
 and said
 Will ye that I let go to you the king of Jews?[b]","And in the ninth hour Jesus cried with a great voice
 and said [saying]
 Eloi
 Eloi
 lama sabachthani
 that is to say [the which is interpreted]
 My God
 my God
 why hast thou forsaken me? ","But the centurion that stood over against saw
 that he so crying had died
 and he said
 Verily
 this man was God's Son [and said
 Verily
 this man was the Son of God]. ","But Pilate wondered
 if he were now dead [Forsooth Pilate wondered
 if he had now died]. And when the centurion was called
 he asked him
 if he were [now] dead; ","And they said together
 Who shall move away to us the stone from the door of the sepulchre? [And they said together
 Who shall turn away to us the stone from the door of the sepulchre?] ","Which saith to them
 Do not ye dread; ye seek Jesus of Nazareth crucified; he is risen
 he is not here; lo! the place where they laid him. ","And he said to them
 Go ye into all the world
 and preach the gospel to each creature. ","Who that believeth
 and is baptized
 shall be safe; but he that believeth not
 shall be condemned.[c] ","And these tokens shall follow them [Forsooth these signs shall follow them]
 that believe. In my name they shall cast out fiends; they shall speak with new tongues; ","they shall do away serpents; and if they drink any venom
 it shall not harm them. They shall set their hands on sick men
 and they shall wax whole.[d] "
