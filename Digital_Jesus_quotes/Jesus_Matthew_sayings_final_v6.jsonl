"And Jesus answering said unto him
 Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him. ","But he answered and said
 It is written
 Man shall not live by bread alone
 but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.","Jesus said unto him
 It is written again
 Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.","Then saith Jesus unto him
 Get thee hence
 Satan: for it is written
 Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God
 and him only shalt thou serve. ","From that time Jesus began to preach
 and to say
 Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.","And he saith unto them
 Follow me
 and I will make you fishers of men. ","Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.","Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.","Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.","Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.","Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.","Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.","Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.","Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness\u2019 sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.","Blessed are ye
 when men shall revile you
 and persecute you
 and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely
 for my sake. ","Rejoice
 and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.","Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour
 wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing
 but to be cast out
 and to be trodden under foot of men. ","Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.","Neither do men light a candle
 and put it under a bushel
 but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. ","Let your light so shine before men
 that they may see your good works
 and glorify your Father which is in heaven.","Think not that I am come to destroy the law
 or the prophets: I am not come to destroy
 but to fulfil. ","For verily I say unto you
 Till heaven and earth pass
 one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law
 till all be fulfilled. ","Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments
 and shall teach men so
 he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them
 the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. ","For I say unto you
 That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees
 ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.","Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time
 Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment: ","but I say unto you
 That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother
 Raca
 shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say
 Thou fool
 shall be in danger of hell fire. ","Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar
 and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee; ","leave there thy gift before the altar
 and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother
 and then come and offer thy gift. ","Agree with thine adversary quickly
 whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge
 and the judge deliver thee to the officer
 and thou be cast into prison. ","Verily I say unto thee
 Thou shalt by no means come out thence
 till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.","Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time
 Thou shalt not commit adultery: ","but I say unto you
 That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart. ","And if thy right eye offend thee
 pluck it out
 and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish
 and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell. ","And if thy right hand offend thee
 cut it off
 and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish
 and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell. ","It hath been said
 Whosoever shall put away his wife
 let him give her a writing of divorcement: ","but I say unto you
 That whosoever shall put away his wife
 saving for the cause of fornication
 causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery.","Again
 ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time
 Thou shalt not forswear thyself
 but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths: ","but I say unto you
 Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God\u2019s throne: ","nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.","Neither shalt thou swear by thy head
 because thou canst not make one hair white or black. ","But let your communication be
 Yea
 yea; Nay
 nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.","Ye have heard that it hath been said
 An eye for an eye
 and a tooth for a tooth: ","but I say unto you
 That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek
 turn to him the other also. ","And if any man will sue thee at the law
 and take away thy coat
 let him have thy cloke also. ","And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile
 go with him twain. ","Give to him that asketh thee
 and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.","Ye have heard that it hath been said
 Thou shalt love thy neighbour
 and hate thine enemy. ","But I say unto you
 Love your enemies
 bless them that curse you
 do good to them that hate you
 and pray for them which despitefully use you
 and persecute you; ","that ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good
 and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust. ","For if ye love them which love you
 what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same? ","And if ye salute your brethren only
 what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so? ","Be ye therefore perfect
 even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.","Take heed that ye do not your alms before men
 to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven. ","Therefore when thou doest thine alms
 do not sound a trumpet before thee
 as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets
 that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you
 They have their reward. ","But when thou doest alms
 let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth: ","that thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.","And when thou prayest
 thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets
 that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you
 They have their reward. ","But thou
 when thou prayest
 enter into thy closet
 and when thou hast shut thy door
 pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly. ","But when ye pray
 use not vain repetitions
 as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. ","Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of
 before ye ask him.","After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven
 Hallowed be thy name. ","Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth
 as it is in heaven. ","Give us this day our daily bread.","And forgive us our debts
 as we forgive our debtors. ","And lead us not into temptation
 but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom
 and the power
 and the glory
 for ever. Amen. ","For if ye forgive men their trespasses
 your heavenly Father will also forgive you: ","but if ye forgive not men their trespasses
 neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.","Moreover when ye fast
 be not
 as the hypocrites
 of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces
 that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you
 They have their reward. ","But thou
 when thou fastest
 anoint thine head
 and wash thy face; ","that thou appear not unto men to fast
 but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father
 which seeth in secret
 shall reward thee openly.","Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth
 where moth and rust doth corrupt
 and where thieves break through and steal: ","but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven
 where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt
 and where thieves do not break through nor steal: ","for where your treasure is
 there will your heart be also. ","The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single
 thy whole body shall be full of light. ","But if thine eye be evil
 thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness
 how great is that darkness!","No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one
 and love the other; or else he will hold to the one
 and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. ","Therefore I say unto you
 Take no thought for your life
 what ye shall eat
 or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body
 what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat
 and the body than raiment? ","Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not
 neither do they reap
 nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they? ","Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?","And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field
 how they grow; they toil not
 neither do they spin: ","and yet I say unto you
 That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. ","Wherefore
 if God so clothe the grass of the field
 which to day is
 and to morrow is cast into the oven
 shall he not much more clothe you
 O ye of little faith? ","Therefore take no thought
 saying
 What shall we eat? or
 What shall we drink? or
 Wherewithal shall we be clothed? ","(For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.","But seek ye first the kingdom of God
 and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you. ","Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.","Judge not
 that ye be not judged. ","For with what judgment ye judge
 ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete
 it shall be measured to you again. ","And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother\u2019s eye
 but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye? ","Or how wilt thou say to thy brother
 Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and
 behold
 a beam is in thine own eye? ","Thou hypocrite
 first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother\u2019s eye.","Give not that which is holy unto the dogs
 neither cast ye your pearls before swine
 lest they trample them under their feet
 and turn again and rend you.","Ask
 and it shall be given you; seek
 and ye shall find; knock
 and it shall be opened unto you: ","for every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.","Or what man is there of you
 whom if his son ask bread
 will he give him a stone? ","Or if he ask a fish
 will he give him a serpent? ","If ye then
 being evil
 know how to give good gifts unto your children
 how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him? ","Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you
 do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.","Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate
 and broad is the way
 that leadeth to destruction
 and many there be which go in thereat: ","because strait is the gate
 and narrow is the way
 which leadeth unto life
 and few there be that find it.","Beware of false prophets
 which come to you in sheep\u2019s clothing
 but inwardly they are ravening wolves. ","Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns
 or figs of thistles? ","Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.","A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit
 neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. ","Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down
 and cast into the fire. ","Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.","Not every one that saith unto me
 Lord
 Lord
 shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. ","Many will say to me in that day
 Lord
 Lord
 have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? ","And then will I profess unto them
 I never knew you: depart from me
 ye that work iniquity.","Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine
 and doeth them
 I will liken him unto a wise man
 which built his house upon a rock: ","and the rain descended
 and the floods came
 and the winds blew
 and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock. ","And every one that heareth these sayings of mine
 and doeth them not
 shall be likened unto a foolish man
 which built his house upon the sand: ","and the rain descended
 and the floods came
 and the winds blew
 and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.","And Jesus put forth his hand
 and touched him
 saying
 I will; be thou clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed. ","And Jesus saith unto him
 See thou tell no man; but go thy way
 shew thyself to the priest
 and offer the gift that Moses commanded
 for a testimony unto them.","And Jesus saith unto him
 I will come and heal him. ","When Jesus heard it
 he marvelled
 and said to them that followed
 Verily I say unto you
 I have not found so great faith
 no
 not in Israel. ","And I say unto you
 That many shall come from the east and west
 and shall sit down with Abraham
 and Isaac
 and Jacob
 in the kingdom of heaven. ","But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.","And Jesus said unto the centurion
 Go thy way; and as thou hast believed
 so be it done unto thee. And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour.","And Jesus saith unto him
 The foxes have holes
 and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head. ","But Jesus said unto him
 Follow me; and let the dead bury their dead.","And he saith unto them
 Why are ye fearful
 O ye of little faith? Then he arose
 and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm. ","And he said unto them
 Go. And when they were come out
 they went into the herd of swine: and
 behold
 the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea
 and perished in the waters. ","And
 behold
 they brought to him a man sick of the palsy
 lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy; Son
 be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee. ","And Jesus knowing their thoughts said
 Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts? ","For whether is easier
 to say
 Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say
 Arise
 and walk? ","But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins
 (then saith he to the sick of the palsy
) Arise
 take up thy bed
 and go unto thine house. ","And as Jesus passed forth from thence
 he saw a man
 named Matthew
 sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto him
 Follow me. And he arose
 and followed him.","But when Jesus heard that
 he said unto them
 They that be whole need not a physician
 but they that are sick. ","But go ye and learn what that meaneth
 I will have mercy
 and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous
 but sinners to repentance.","And Jesus said unto them
 Can the children of the bridechamber mourn
 as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come
 when the bridegroom shall be taken from them
 and then shall they fast. ","No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment
 for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment
 and the rent is made worse. ","Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles break
 and the wine runneth out
 and the bottles perish: but they put new wine into new bottles
 and both are preserved.","But Jesus turned him about
 and when he saw her
 he said
 Daughter
 be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour.","he said unto them
 Give place: for the maid is not dead
 but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn. ","And when he was come into the house
 the blind men came to him: and Jesus saith unto them
 Believe ye that I am able to do this? They said unto him
 Yea
 Lord. ","And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly charged them
 saying
 See that no man know it. ","Then saith he unto his disciples
 The harvest truly is plenteous
 but the labourers are few; ","pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest
 that he will send forth labourers into his harvest.","These twelve Jesus sent forth
 and commanded them
 saying
 Go not into the way of the Gentiles
 and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not: ","but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.","And as ye go
 preach
 saying
 The kingdom of heaven is at hand. ","Heal the sick
 cleanse the lepers
 raise the dead
 cast out devils: freely ye have received
 freely give. ","Provide neither gold
 nor silver
 nor brass in your purses
 ","nor scrip for your journey
 neither two coats
 neither shoes
 nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat. ","And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter
 enquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence. ","And when ye come into an house
 salute it. ","And if the house be worthy
 let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy
 let your peace return to you. ","And whosoever shall not receive you
 nor hear your words
 when ye depart out of that house or city
 shake off the dust of your feet. ","Verily I say unto you
 It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment
 than for that city.","Behold
 I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents
 and harmless as doves. ","But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils
 and they will scourge you in their synagogues; ","and ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake
 for a testimony against them and the Gentiles. ","But when they deliver you up
 take no thought how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak. ","For it is not ye that speak
 but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you. ","And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death
 and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against their parents
 and cause them to be put to death. ","And ye shall be hated of all men for my name\u2019s sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be saved.","But when they persecute you in this city
 flee ye into another: for verily I say unto you
 Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel
 till the Son of man be come. ","The disciple is not above his master
 nor the servant above his lord. ","It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master
 and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub
 how much more shall they call them of his household? ","Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered
 that shall not be revealed; and hid
 that shall not be known. ","What I tell you in darkness
 that speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear
 that preach ye upon the housetops. ","And fear not them which kill the body
 but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.","Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.","But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.","Fear ye not therefore
 ye are of more value than many sparrows.","Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men
 him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven. ","But whosoever shall deny me before men
 him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven.","Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace
 but a sword. ","For I am come to set a man at variance against his father
 and the daughter against her mother
 and the daughter in law against her mother in law. ","And a man\u2019s foes shall be they of his own household.","He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.","And he that taketh not his cross
 and followeth after me
 is not worthy of me. ","He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.","He that receiveth you receiveth me
 and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me. ","He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet\u2019s reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man\u2019s reward.","And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple
 verily I say unto you
 he shall in no wise lose his reward.","Jesus answered and said unto them
 Go and shew John again those things which ye do hear and see: ","the blind receive their sight
 and the lame walk
 the lepers are cleansed
 and the deaf hear
 the dead are raised up
 and the poor have the gospel preached to them. ","And blessed is he
 whosoever shall not be offended in me.","And as they departed
 Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John
 What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind? ","But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? behold
 they that wear soft clothing are in kings\u2019 houses. ","But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea
 I say unto you
 and more than a prophet. ","For this is he
 of whom it is written
 Behold
 I send my messenger before thy face
 which shall prepare thy way before thee. ","Verily I say unto you
 Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. ","And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence
 and the violent take it by force. ","For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.","And if ye will receive it
 this is Elias
 which was for to come. ","He that hath ears to hear
 let him hear.","But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like unto children sitting in the markets
 and calling unto their fellows
 ","and saying
 We have piped unto you
 and ye have not danced; we have mourned unto you
 and ye have not lamented. ","For John came neither eating nor drinking
 and they say
 He hath a devil. ","The Son of man came eating and drinking
 and they say
 Behold a man gluttonous
 and a winebibber
 a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified of her children.","Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done
 because they repented not: ","Woe unto thee
 Chorazin! woe unto thee
 Bethsaida! for if the mighty works
 which were done in you
 had been done in Tyre and Sidon
 they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. ","But I say unto you
 It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment
 than for you. ","And thou
 Capernaum
 which art exalted unto heaven
 shalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works
 which have been done in thee
 had been done in Sodom
 it would have remained until this day. ","But I say unto you
 That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment
 than for thee.","At that time Jesus answered and said
 I thank thee
 O Father
 Lord of heaven and earth
 because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent
 and hast revealed them unto babes. ","Even so
 Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight. ","All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Son
 but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father
 save the Son
 and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.","Come unto me
 all ye that labour and are heavy laden
 and I will give you rest. ","Take my yoke upon you
 and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. ","For my yoke is easy
 and my burden is light.","But he said unto them
 Have ye not read what David did
 when he was an hungred
 and they that were with him; ","how he entered into the house of God
 and did eat the shewbread
 which was not lawful for him to eat
 neither for them which were with him
 but only for the priests? ","Or have ye not read in the law
 how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath
 and are blameless? ","But I say unto you
 That in this place is one greater than the temple. ","But if ye had known what this meaneth
 I will have mercy
 and not sacrifice
 ye would not have condemned the guiltless. ","For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day.","And he said unto them
 What man shall there be among you
 that shall have one sheep
 and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day
 will he not lay hold on it
 and lift it out? ","How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days.","Then saith he to the man
 Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole
 like as the other.","And Jesus knew their thoughts
 and said unto them
 Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand: ","and if Satan cast out Satan
 he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand? ","And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils
 by whom do your children cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges. ","But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God
 then the kingdom of God is come unto you. ","Or else how can one enter into a strong man\u2019s house
 and spoil his goods
 except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house. ","He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.","Wherefore I say unto you
 All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men. ","And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man
 it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost
 it shall not be forgiven him
 neither in this world
 neither in the world to come. ","Either make the tree good
 and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt
 and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by his fruit. ","O generation of vipers
 how can ye
 being evil
 speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. ","A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.","But I say unto you
 That every idle word that men shall speak
 they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment. ","For by thy words thou shalt be justified
 and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.","But he answered and said unto them
 An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it
 but the sign of the prophet Jonas: ","for as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale\u2019s belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.","The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation
 and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and
 behold
 a greater than Jonas is here. ","The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation
 and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and
 behold
 a greater than Solomon is here.","When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man
 he walketh through dry places
 seeking rest
 and findeth none. ","Then he saith
 I will return into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come
 he findeth it empty
 swept
 and garnished. ","Then goeth he
 and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself
 and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation.","While he yet talked to the people
 behold
 his mother and his brethren stood without
 desiring to speak with him. ","But he answered and said unto him that told him
 Who is my mother? and who are my brethren? ","And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples
 and said
 Behold my mother and my brethren! ","For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven
 the same is my brother
 and sister
 and mother.","And he spake many things unto them in parables
 saying
 Behold
 a sower went forth to sow; ","and when he sowed
 some seeds fell by the way side
 and the fowls came and devoured them up: ","some fell upon stony places
 where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up
 because they had no deepness of earth: ","and when the sun was up
 they were scorched; and because they had no root
 they withered away. ","And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up
 and choked them: ","but other fell into good ground
 and brought forth fruit
 some an hundredfold
 some sixtyfold
 some thirtyfold. ","Who hath ears to hear
 let him hear.","He answered and said unto them
 Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven
 but to them it is not given. ","For whosoever hath
 to him shall be given
 and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not
 from him shall be taken away even that he hath. ","Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not
 neither do they understand. ","And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias
 which saith
 By hearing ye shall hear
 and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see
 and shall not perceive: ","for this people\u2019s heart is waxed gross
 and their ears are dull of hearing
 and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with their eyes
 and hear with their ears
 and should understand with their heart
 and should be converted
 and I should heal them. ","But blessed are your eyes
 for they see: and your ears
 for they hear. ","For verily I say unto you
 That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see
 and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear
 and have not heard them.","Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.","When any one heareth the word of the kingdom
 and understandeth it not
 then cometh the wicked one
 and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side. ","But he that received the seed into stony places
 the same is he that heareth the word
 and anon with joy receiveth it; ","yet hath he not root in himself
 but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word
 by and by he is offended. ","He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world
 and the deceitfulness of riches
 choke the word
 and he becometh unfruitful. ","But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word
 and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit
 and bringeth forth
 some an hundredfold
 some sixty
 some thirty.","Another parable put he forth unto them
 saying
 The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field: ","but while men slept
 his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat
 and went his way. ","But when the blade was sprung up
 and brought forth fruit
 then appeared the tares also. ","So the servants of the householder came and said unto him
 Sir
 didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares? ","He said unto them
 An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him
 Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? ","But he said
 Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares
 ye root up also the wheat with them. ","Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers
 Gather ye together first the tares
 and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.","Another parable put he forth unto them
 saying
 The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed
 which a man took
 and sowed in his field: ","which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown
 it is the greatest among herbs
 and becometh a tree
 so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.","Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven
 which a woman took
 and hid in three measures of meal
 till the whole was leavened.","He answered and said unto them
 He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man; ","the field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;","the enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.","As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.","The Son of man shall send forth his angels
 and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend
 and them which do iniquity; ","and shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.","Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear
 let him hear.","Again
 the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found
 he hideth
 and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath
 and buyeth that field.","Again
 the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man
 seeking goodly pearls: ","who
 when he had found one pearl of great price
 went and sold all that he had
 and bought it.","Again
 the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net
 that was cast into the sea
 and gathered of every kind: ","which
 when it was full
 they drew to shore
 and sat down
 and gathered the good into vessels
 but cast the bad away. ","So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth
 and sever the wicked from among the just
 ","and shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.","Jesus saith unto them
 Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him
 Yea
 Lord. ","Then said he unto them
 Therefore every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder
 which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old.","And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them
 A prophet is not without honour
 save in his own country
 and in his own house. ","But Jesus said unto them
 They need not depart; give ye them to eat. ","He said
 Bring them hither to me. ","But straightway Jesus spake unto them
 saying
 Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid. ","And he said
 Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship
 he walked on the water
 to go to Jesus. ","And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand
 and caught him
 and said unto him
 O thou of little faith
 wherefore didst thou doubt? ","But he answered and said unto them
 Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition? ","For God commanded
 saying
 Honour thy father and mother: and
 He that curseth father or mother
 let him die the death. ","But ye say
 Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother
 It is a gift
 by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; ","and honour not his father or his mother
 he shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition. ","Ye hypocrites
 well did Esaias prophesy of you
 saying
 ","This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth
 and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me. ","But in vain they do worship me
 teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.","And he called the multitude
 and said unto them
 Hear
 and understand: ","not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth
 this defileth a man.","But he answered and said
 Every plant
 which my heavenly Father hath not planted
 shall be rooted up. ","Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind
 both shall fall into the ditch.","And Jesus said
 Are ye also yet without understanding? ","Do not ye yet understand
 that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly
 and is cast out into the draught? ","But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.","For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts
 murders
 adulteries
 fornications
 thefts
 false witness
 blasphemies: ","these are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.","But he answered and said
 I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel. ","But he answered and said
 It is not meet to take the children\u2019s bread
 and to cast it to dogs. ","Then Jesus answered and said unto her
 O woman
 great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.","Then Jesus called his disciples unto him
 and said
 I have compassion on the multitude
 because they continue with me now three days
 and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting
 lest they faint in the way. ","And Jesus saith unto them
 How many loaves have ye? And they said
 Seven
 and a few little fishes. ","He answered and said unto them
 When it is evening
 ye say
 It will be fair weather: for the sky is red. ","And in the morning
 It will be foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowring. O ye hypocrites
 ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times? ","A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it
 but the sign of the prophet Jonas. And he left them
 and departed.","Then Jesus said unto them
 Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees. ","Which when Jesus perceived
 he said unto them
 O ye of little faith
 why reason ye among yourselves
 because ye have brought no bread? ","Do ye not yet understand
 neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand
 and how many baskets ye took up? ","Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand
 and how many baskets ye took up? ","How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you concerning bread
 that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees? ","When Jesus came into the coasts of C\u00e6sarea Philippi
 he asked his disciples
 saying
 Whom do men say that I the Son of man am? ","He saith unto them
 But whom say ye that I am? ","And Jesus answered and said unto him
 Blessed art thou
 Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee
 but my Father which is in heaven. ","And I say also unto thee
 That thou art Peter
 and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. ","And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.","But he turned
 and said unto Peter
 Get thee behind me
 Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of God
 but those that be of men.","Then said Jesus unto his disciples
 If any man will come after me
 let him deny himself
 and take up his cross
 and follow me. ","For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.","For what is a man profited
 if he shall gain the whole world
 and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? ","For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works.","Verily I say unto you
 There be some standing here
 which shall not taste of death
 till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.","And Jesus came and touched them
 and said
 Arise
 and be not afraid. ","And as they came down from the mountain
 Jesus charged them
 saying
 Tell the vision to no man
 until the Son of man be risen again from the dead. ","And Jesus answered and said unto them
 Elias truly shall first come
 and restore all things. ","But I say unto you
 That Elias is come already
 and they knew him not
 but have done unto him whatsoever they listed. Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them. ","Then Jesus answered and said
 O faithless and perverse generation
 how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him hither to me. ","And Jesus said unto them
 Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you
 If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed
 ye shall say unto this mountain
 Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you. ","And while they abode in Galilee
 Jesus said unto them
 The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men: ","and they shall kill him
 and the third day he shall be raised again. And they were exceeding sorry.","He saith
 Yes. And when he was come into the house
 Jesus prevented him
 saying
 What thinkest thou
 Simon? of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own children
 or of strangers? ","Peter saith unto him
 Of strangers. Jesus saith unto him
 Then are the children free. ","Notwithstanding
 lest we should offend them
 go thou to the sea
 and cast an hook
 and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth
 thou shalt find a piece of money: that take
 and give unto them for me and thee.","and said
 Verily I say unto you
 Except ye be converted
 and become as little children
 ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. ","Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child
 the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven. ","And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me.","But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me
 it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck
 and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.","Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!","Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee
 cut them off
 and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed
 rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire. ","And if thine eye offend thee
 pluck it out
 and cast it from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye
 rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire. ","Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you
 That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven. ","How think ye? if a man have an hundred sheep
 and one of them be gone astray
 doth he not leave the ninety and nine
 and goeth into the mountains
 and seeketh that which is gone astray? ","And if so be that he find it
 verily I say unto you
 he rejoiceth more of that sheep
 than of the ninety and nine which went not astray. ","Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven
 that one of these little ones should perish.","Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee
 go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee
 thou hast gained thy brother. ","But if he will not hear thee
 then take with thee one or two more
 that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established. ","And if he shall neglect to hear them
 tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church
 let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican. ","Verily I say unto you
 Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. ","Again I say unto you
 That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask
 it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven. ","For where two or three are gathered together in my name
 there am I in the midst of them.","Jesus saith unto him
 I say not unto thee
 Until seven times: but
 Until seventy times seven. ","Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king
 which would take account of his servants. ","And when he had begun to reckon
 one was brought unto him
 which owed him ten thousand talents. ","But forasmuch as he had not to pay
 his lord commanded him to be sold
 and his wife
 and children
 and all that he had
 and payment to be made. ","The servant therefore fell down
 and worshipped him
 saying
 Lord
 have patience with me
 and I will pay thee all. ","Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion
 and loosed him
 and forgave him the debt. ","But the same servant went out
 and found one of his fellowservants
 which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him
 and took him by the throat
 saying
 Pay me that thou owest. ","And his fellowservant fell down at his feet
 and besought him
 saying
 Have patience with me
 and I will pay thee all. ","And he would not: but went and cast him into prison
 till he should pay the debt. ","So when his fellowservants saw what was done
 they were very sorry
 and came and told unto their lord all that was done. ","Then his lord
 after that he had called him
 said unto him
 O thou wicked servant
 I forgave thee all that debt
 because thou desiredst me: ","shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant
 even as I had pity on thee? ","And his lord was wroth
 and delivered him to the tormentors
 till he should pay all that was due unto him. ","So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you
 if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.","And he answered and said unto them
 Have ye not read
 that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female
 ","and said
 For this cause shall a man leave father and mother
 and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh? ","Wherefore they are no more twain
 but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together
 let not man put asunder. ","He saith unto them
 Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so. ","And I say unto you
 Whosoever shall put away his wife
 except it be for fornication
 and shall marry another
 committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.","But he said unto them
 All men cannot receive this saying
 save they to whom it is given. ","For there are some eunuchs
 which were so born from their mother\u2019s womb: and there are some eunuchs
 which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs
 which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven\u2019s sake. He that is able to receive it
 let him receive it.","But Jesus said
 Suffer little children
 and forbid them not
 to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven. ","And he said unto him
 Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one
 that is
 God: but if thou wilt enter into life
 keep the commandments. ","He saith unto him
 Which? Jesus said
 Thou shalt do no murder
 Thou shalt not commit adultery
 Thou shalt not steal
 Thou shalt not bear false witness
 ","Honour thy father and thy mother: and
 Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. ","Jesus said unto him
 If thou wilt be perfect
 go and sell that thou hast
 and give to the poor
 and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me. ","Then said Jesus unto his disciples
 Verily I say unto you
 That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven. ","And again I say unto you
 It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle
 than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. ","But Jesus beheld them
 and said unto them
 With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.","And Jesus said unto them
 Verily I say unto you
 That ye which have followed me
 in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory
 ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones
 judging the twelve tribes of Israel. ","And every one that hath forsaken houses
 or brethren
 or sisters
 or father
 or mother
 or wife
 or children
 or lands
 for my name\u2019s sake
 shall receive an hundredfold
 and shall inherit everlasting life. ","But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.","For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder
 which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard. ","And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day
 he sent them into his vineyard. ","And he went out about the third hour
 and saw others standing idle in the marketplace
 ","and said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard
 and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way. ","Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour
 and did likewise. ","And about the eleventh hour he went out
 and found others standing idle
 and saith unto them
 Why stand ye here all the day idle? ","They say unto him
 Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them
 Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right
 that shall ye receive. ","So when even was come
 the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward
 Call the labourers
 and give them their hire
 beginning from the last unto the first. ","And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour
 they received every man a penny. ","But when the first came
 they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny. ","And when they had received it
 they murmured against the goodman of the house
 ","saying
 These last have wrought but one hour
 and thou hast made them equal unto us
 which have borne the burden and heat of the day. ","But he answered one of them
 and said
 Friend
 I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny? ","Take that thine is
 and go thy way: I will give unto this last
 even as unto thee. ","Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil
 because I am good? ","So the last shall be first
 and the first last: for many be called
 but few chosen.","Behold
 we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes
 and they shall condemn him to death
 ","and shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock
 and to scourge
 and to crucify him: and the third day he shall rise again.","And he said unto her
 What wilt thou? She saith unto him
 Grant that these my two sons may sit
 the one on thy right hand
 and the other on the left
 in thy kingdom. ","But Jesus answered and said
 Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of
 and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say unto him
 We are able. ","But Jesus called them unto him
 and said
 Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them
 and they that are great exercise authority upon them. ","But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great among you
 let him be your minister; ","and whosoever will be chief among you
 let him be your servant: ","even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto
 but to minister
 and to give his life a ransom for many.","And Jesus stood still
 and called them
 and said
 What will ye that I shall do unto you? ","saying unto them
 Go into the village over against you
 and straightway ye shall find an ass tied
 and a colt with her: loose them
 and bring them unto me. ","And if any man say ought unto you
 ye shall say
 The Lord hath need of them; and straightway he will send them. ","and said unto them
 It is written
 My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.","and said unto him
 Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus saith unto them
 Yea; have ye never read
 Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise? ","And when he saw a fig tree in the way
 he came to it
 and found nothing thereon
 but leaves only
 and said unto it
 Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever. And presently the fig tree withered away. ","Jesus answered and said unto them
 Verily I say unto you
 If ye have faith
 and doubt not
 ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree
 but also if ye shall say unto this mountain
 Be thou removed
 and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done. ","And all things
 whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer
 believing
 ye shall receive.","And Jesus answered and said unto them
 I also will ask you one thing
 which if ye tell me
 I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do these things. ","The baptism of John
 whence was it? from heaven
 or of men? And they reasoned with themselves
 saying
 If we shall say
 From heaven; he will say unto us
 Why did ye not then believe him? ","And they answered Jesus
 and said
 We cannot tell. And he said unto them
 Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.","But what think ye? A certain man had two sons; and he came to the first
 and said
 Son
 go work to day in my vineyard. ","He answered and said
 I will not: but afterward he repented
 and went. ","And he came to the second
 and said likewise. And he answered and said
 I go
 sir: and went not. ","Whether of them twain did the will of his father? They say unto him
 The first. Jesus saith unto them
 Verily I say unto you
 That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you. ","For John came unto you in the way of righteousness
 and ye believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye
 when ye had seen it
 repented not afterward
 that ye might believe him.","Hear another parable: There was a certain householder
 which planted a vineyard
 and hedged it round about
 and digged a winepress in it
 and built a tower
 and let it out to husbandmen
 and went into a far country: ","and when the time of the fruit drew near
 he sent his servants to the husbandmen
 that they might receive the fruits of it. ","And the husbandmen took his servants
 and beat one
 and killed another
 and stoned another. ","Again
 he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them likewise. ","But last of all he sent unto them his son
 saying
 They will reverence my son. ","But when the husbandmen saw the son
 they said among themselves
 This is the heir; come
 let us kill him
 and let us seize on his inheritance. ","And they caught him
 and cast him out of the vineyard
 and slew him. ","When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh
 what will he do unto those husbandmen? ","They say unto him
 He will miserably destroy those wicked men
 and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen
 which shall render him the fruits in their seasons. ","Jesus saith unto them
 Did ye never read in the scriptures
 The stone which the builders rejected
 the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord\u2019s doing
 and it is marvellous in our eyes? ","Therefore say I unto you
 The kingdom of God shall be taken from you
 and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof. ","And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall
 it will grind him to powder. ","The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king
 which made a marriage for his son
 ","and sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding: and they would not come.","Again
 he sent forth other servants
 saying
 Tell them which are bidden
 Behold
 I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings are killed
 and all things are ready: come unto the marriage. ","But they made light of it
 and went their ways
 one to his farm
 another to his merchandise: ","and the remnant took his servants
 and entreated them spitefully
 and slew them. ","But when the king heard thereof
 he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies
 and destroyed those murderers
 and burned up their city. ","Then saith he to his servants
 The wedding is ready
 but they which were bidden were not worthy. ","Go ye therefore into the highways
 and as many as ye shall find
 bid to the marriage. ","So those servants went out into the highways
 and gathered together all as many as they found
 both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests. ","And when the king came in to see the guests
 he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment: ","and he saith unto him
 Friend
 how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless. ","Then said the king to the servants
 Bind him hand and foot
 and take him away
 and cast him into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. ","For many are called
 but few are chosen.","But Jesus perceived their wickedness
 and said
 Why tempt ye me
 ye hypocrites? ","Shew me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny.","And he saith unto them
 Whose is this image and superscription? ","They say unto him
 C\u00e6sar\u2019s. Then saith he unto them
 Render therefore unto C\u00e6sar the things which are C\u00e6sar\u2019s; and unto God the things that are God\u2019s. ","Jesus answered and said unto them
 Ye do err
 not knowing the scriptures
 nor the power of God. ","For in the resurrection they neither marry
 nor are given in marriage
 but are as the angels of God in heaven. ","But as touching the resurrection of the dead
 have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God
 saying
 ","I am the God of Abraham
 and the God of Isaac
 and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead
 but of the living. ","Jesus said unto him
 Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart
 and with all thy soul
 and with all thy mind. ","This is the first and great commandment.","And the second is like unto it
 Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. ","On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.","saying
 What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say unto him
 The Son of David. ","He saith unto them
 How then doth David in spirit call him Lord
 saying
 ","The Lord said unto my Lord
 Sit thou on my right hand
 till I make thine enemies thy footstool? ","If David then call him Lord
 how is he his son? ","saying
 The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses\u2019 seat: ","all therefore whatsoever they bid you observe
 that observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say
 and do not. ","For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne
 and lay them on men\u2019s shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers. ","But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries
 and enlarge the borders of their garments
 ","and love the uppermost rooms at feasts
 and the chief seats in the synagogues
 ","and greetings in the markets
 and to be called of men
 Rabbi
 Rabbi. ","But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master
 even Christ; and all ye are brethren. ","And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father
 which is in heaven. ","Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master
 even Christ. ","But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.","And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted.","But woe unto you
 scribes and Pharisees
 hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves
 neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in. ","Woe unto you
 scribes and Pharisees
 hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte
 and when he is made
 ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.","Woe unto you
 ye blind guides
 which say
 Whosoever shall swear by the temple
 it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple
 he is a debtor! ","Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater
 the gold
 or the temple that sanctifieth the gold? ","And
 Whosoever shall swear by the altar
 it is nothing; but whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it
 he is guilty. ","Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater
 the gift
 or the altar that sanctifieth the gift? ","Whoso therefore shall swear by the altar
 sweareth by it
 and by all things thereon. ","And whoso shall swear by the temple
 sweareth by it
 and by him that dwelleth therein. ","And he that shall swear by heaven
 sweareth by the throne of God
 and by him that sitteth thereon.","Woe unto you
 scribes and Pharisees
 hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin
 and have omitted the weightier matters of the law
 judgment
 mercy
 and faith: these ought ye to have done
 and not to leave the other undone. ","Ye blind guides
 which strain at a gnat
 and swallow a camel. ","Woe unto you
 scribes and Pharisees
 hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter
 but within they are full of extortion and excess. ","Thou blind Pharisee
 cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter
 that the outside of them may be clean also. ","Woe unto you
 scribes and Pharisees
 hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres
 which indeed appear beautiful outward
 but are within full of dead men\u2019s bones
 and of all uncleanness. ","Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men
 but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.","Woe unto you
 scribes and Pharisees
 hypocrites! because ye build the tombs of the prophets
 and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous
 ","and say
 If we had been in the days of our fathers
 we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets. ","Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves
 that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets. ","Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers.","Ye serpents
 ye generation of vipers
 how can ye escape the damnation of hell?","Wherefore
 behold
 I send unto you prophets
 and wise men
 and scribes: and some of them ye shall kill and crucify; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues
 and persecute them from city to city: ","that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth
 from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias
 whom ye slew between the temple and the altar. ","Verily I say unto you
 All these things shall come upon this generation. ","O Jerusalem
 Jerusalem
 thou that killest the prophets
 and stonest them which are sent unto thee
 how often would I have gathered thy children together
 even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings
 and ye would not! ","Behold
 your house is left unto you desolate. ","For I say unto you
 Ye shall not see me henceforth
 till ye shall say
 Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.","And Jesus said unto them
 See ye not all these things? verily I say unto you
 There shall not be left here one stone upon another
 that shall not be thrown down.","And Jesus answered and said unto them
 Take heed that no man deceive you. ","For many shall come in my name
 saying
 I am Christ; and shall deceive many. ","And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass
 but the end is not yet. ","For nation shall rise against nation
 and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines
 and pestilences
 and earthquakes
 in divers places. ","All these are the beginning of sorrows.","Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted
 and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name\u2019s sake. ","And then shall many be offended
 and shall betray one another
 and shall hate one another. ","And many false prophets shall rise
 and shall deceive many. ","And because iniquity shall abound
 the love of many shall wax cold. ","But he that shall endure unto the end
 the same shall be saved. ","And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.","When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation
 spoken of by Daniel the prophet
 stand in the holy place
 (whoso readeth
 let him understand:) ","then let them which be in Jud\u00e6a flee into the mountains:","let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house:","neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes.","And woe unto them that are with child
 and to them that give suck in those days! ","But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter
 neither on the sabbath day: ","for then shall be great tribulation
 such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time
 no
 nor ever shall be. ","And except those days should be shortened
 there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect\u2019s sake those days shall be shortened.","Then if any man shall say unto you
 Lo
 here is Christ
 or there; believe it not. ","For there shall arise false Christs
 and false prophets
 and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that
 if it were possible
 they shall deceive the very elect. ","Behold
 I have told you before. ","Wherefore if they shall say unto you
 Behold
 he is in the desert; go not forth: behold
 he is in the secret chambers; believe it not. ","For as the lightning cometh out of the east
 and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. ","For wheresoever the carcase is
 there will the eagles be gathered together.","Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened
 and the moon shall not give her light
 and the stars shall fall from heaven
 and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken: ","and then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn
 and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. ","And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet
 and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds
 from one end of heaven to the other.","Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender
 and putteth forth leaves
 ye know that summer is nigh: ","so likewise ye
 when ye shall see all these things
 know that it is near
 even at the doors. ","Verily I say unto you
 This generation shall not pass
 till all these things be fulfilled. ","Heaven and earth shall pass away
 but my words shall not pass away.","But of that day and hour knoweth no man
 no
 not the angels of heaven
 but my Father only. ","But as the days of Noe were
 so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. ","For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking
 marrying and giving in marriage
 until the day that Noe entered into the ark
 ","and knew not until the flood came
 and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. ","Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken
 and the other left. ","Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken
 and the other left. ","Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.","But know this
 that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come
 he would have watched
 and would not have suffered his house to be broken up. ","Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.","Who then is a faithful and wise servant
 whom his lord hath made ruler over his household
 to give them meat in due season? ","Blessed is that servant
 whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing. ","Verily I say unto you
 That he shall make him ruler over all his goods. ","But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart
 My lord delayeth his coming; ","and shall begin to smite his fellowservants
 and to eat and drink with the drunken; ","the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him
 and in an hour that he is not aware of
 ","and shall cut him asunder
 and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.","Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins
 which took their lamps
 and went forth to meet the bridegroom. ","And five of them were wise
 and five were foolish. ","They that were foolish took their lamps
 and took no oil with them: ","but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.","While the bridegroom tarried
 they all slumbered and slept. ","And at midnight there was a cry made
 Behold
 the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him. ","Then all those virgins arose
 and trimmed their lamps. ","And the foolish said unto the wise
 Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out. ","But the wise answered
 saying
 Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell
 and buy for yourselves. ","And while they went to buy
 the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut. ","Afterward came also the other virgins
 saying
 Lord
 Lord
 open to us. ","But he answered and said
 Verily I say unto you
 I know you not. ","Watch therefore
 for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.","For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country
 who called his own servants
 and delivered unto them his goods. ","And unto one he gave five talents
 to another two
 and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey. ","Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same
 and made them other five talents. ","And likewise he that had received two
 he also gained other two. ","But he that had received one went and digged in the earth
 and hid his lord\u2019s money. ","After a long time the lord of those servants cometh
 and reckoneth with them. ","And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents
 saying
 Lord
 thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold
 I have gained beside them five talents more. ","His lord said unto him
 Well done
 thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things
 I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. ","He also that had received two talents came and said
 Lord
 thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold
 I have gained two other talents beside them. ","His lord said unto him
 Well done
 good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things
 I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. ","Then he which had received the one talent came and said
 Lord
 I knew thee that thou art an hard man
 reaping where thou hast not sown
 and gathering where thou hast not strawed: ","and I was afraid
 and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo
 there thou hast that is thine. ","His lord answered and said unto him
 Thou wicked and slothful servant
 thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not
 and gather where I have not strawed: ","thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers
 and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury. ","Take therefore the talent from him
 and give it unto him which hath ten talents. ","For unto every one that hath shall be given
 and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath. ","And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.","When the Son of man shall come in his glory
 and all the holy angels with him
 then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: ","and before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another
 as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats: ","and he shall set the sheep on his right hand
 but the goats on the left. ","Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand
 Come
 ye blessed of my Father
 inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: ","for I was an hungred
 and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty
 and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger
 and ye took me in: ","naked
 and ye clothed me: I was sick
 and ye visited me: I was in prison
 and ye came unto me. ","Then shall the righteous answer him
 saying
 Lord
 when saw we thee an hungred
 and fed thee? or thirsty
 and gave thee drink? ","When saw we thee a stranger
 and took thee in? or naked
 and clothed thee? ","Or when saw we thee sick
 or in prison
 and came unto thee? ","And the King shall answer and say unto them
 Verily I say unto you
 Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren
 ye have done it unto me. ","Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand
 Depart from me
 ye cursed
 into everlasting fire
 prepared for the devil and his angels: ","for I was an hungred
 and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty
 and ye gave me no drink: ","I was a stranger
 and ye took me not in: naked
 and ye clothed me not: sick
 and in prison
 and ye visited me not. ","Then shall they also answer him
 saying
 Lord
 when saw we thee an hungred
 or athirst
 or a stranger
 or naked
 or sick
 or in prison
 and did not minister unto thee? ","Then shall he answer them
 saying
 Verily I say unto you
 Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these
 ye did it not to me. ","And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.","Ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover
 and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified. ","When Jesus understood it
 he said unto them
 Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me. ","For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.","For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body
 she did it for my burial. ","Verily I say unto you
 Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world
 there shall also this
 that this woman hath done
 be told for a memorial of her.","And he said
 Go into the city to such a man
 and say unto him
 The Master saith
 My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples. ","And as they did eat
 he said
 Verily I say unto you
 that one of you shall betray me. ","And he answered and said
 He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish
 the same shall betray me. ","The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.","Then Judas
 which betrayed him
 answered and said
 Master
 is it I? He said unto him
 Thou hast said.","And as they were eating
 Jesus took bread
 and blessed it
 and brake it
 and gave it to the disciples
 and said
 Take
 eat; this is my body. ","And he took the cup
 and gave thanks
 and gave it to them
 saying
 Drink ye all of it; ","for this is my blood of the new testament
 which is shed for many for the remission of sins. ","But I say unto you
 I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine
 until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father\u2019s kingdom.","Then saith Jesus unto them
 All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written
 I will smite the shepherd
 and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad. ","But after I am risen again
 I will go before you into Galilee. ","Jesus said unto him
 Verily I say unto thee
 That this night
 before the cock crow
 thou shalt deny me thrice. ","Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane
 and saith unto the disciples
 Sit ye here
 while I go and pray yonder. ","Then saith he unto them
 My soul is exceeding sorrowful
 even unto death: tarry ye here
 and watch with me. ","And he went a little further
 and fell on his face
 and prayed
 saying
 O my Father
 if it be possible
 let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will
 but as thou wilt.","And he cometh unto the disciples
 and findeth them asleep
 and saith unto Peter
 What
 could ye not watch with me one hour? ","Watch and pray
 that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing
 but the flesh is weak.","He went away again the second time
 and prayed
 saying
 O my Father
 if this cup may not pass away from me
 except I drink it
 thy will be done. ","Then cometh he to his disciples
 and saith unto them
 Sleep on now
 and take your rest: behold
 the hour is at hand
 and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. ","Rise
 let us be going: behold
 he is at hand that doth betray me.","And Jesus said unto him
 Friend
 wherefore art thou come? Then came they
 and laid hands on Jesus
 and took him.","Then said Jesus unto him
 Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword. ","Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father
 and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels? ","But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled
 that thus it must be?","In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes
 Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple
 and ye laid no hold on me. ","But all this was done
 that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him
 and fled.","Jesus saith unto him
 Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you
 Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power
 and coming in the clouds of heaven. ","And Peter remembered the word of Jesus
 which said unto him
 Before the cock crow
 thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out
 and wept bitterly.","And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him
 saying
 Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him
 Thou sayest. ","And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice
 saying
 Eli
 Eli
 lama sabachthani? that is to say
 My God
 my God
 why hast thou forsaken me? ","And as they went to tell his disciples
 behold
 Jesus met them
 saying
 All hail. And they came and held him by the feet
 and worshipped him. ","Then said Jesus unto them
 Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee
 and there shall they see me.","And Jesus came and spake unto them
 saying
 All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. ","Go ye therefore
 and teach all nations
 baptizing them in the name of the Father
 and of the Son
 and of the Holy Ghost: ","teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and
 lo
 I am with you alway
 even unto the end of the world. Amen.","But Jesus replied to him
 \u201cPermit it just now; for this is the fitting way for us to fulfill all righteousness.\u201d Then John permitted [it and baptized] Him. ","But Jesus replied
 \u201cIt is written and forever remains written
 \u2018Man shall not live by bread alone
 but by every word that comes out of the mouth of God.\u2019\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cOn the other hand
 it is written and forever remains written
 \u2018You shall not test the Lord your God.\u2019\u201d","Then Jesus said to him
 \u201cGo away
 Satan! For it is written and forever remains written
 \u2018You shall worship the Lord your God
 and serve Him only.\u2019\u201d ","From that time Jesus began to preach and say
 \u201cRepent [change your inner self\u2014your old way of thinking
 regret past sins
 live your life in a way that proves repentance; seek God\u2019s purpose for your life]
 for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cFollow Me [as My disciples
 accepting Me as your Master and Teacher and walking the same path of life that I walk]
 and I will make you fishers of men.\u201d ","\u201cBlessed [spiritually prosperous
 happy
 to be admired] are the poor in spirit [those devoid of spiritual arrogance
 those who regard themselves as insignificant]
 for theirs is the kingdom of heaven [both now and forever].","\u201cBlessed [forgiven
 refreshed by God\u2019s grace] are those who mourn [over their sins and repent]
 for they will be comforted [when the burden of sin is lifted].","\u201cBlessed [inwardly peaceful
 spiritually secure
 worthy of respect] are the gentle [the kind-hearted
 the sweet-spirited
 the self-controlled]
 for they will inherit the earth.","\u201cBlessed [joyful
 nourished by God\u2019s goodness] are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness [those who actively seek right standing with God]
 for they will be  satisfied.","\u201cBlessed [content
 sheltered by God\u2019s promises] are the merciful
 for they will receive mercy.","\u201cBlessed [anticipating God\u2019s presence
 spiritually mature] are the pure in heart [those with integrity
 moral courage
 and godly character]
 for they will see God.","\u201cBlessed [spiritually calm with life-joy in God\u2019s favor] are the makers and maintainers of peace
 for they will [express His character and] be called the sons of God.","\u201cBlessed [comforted by inner peace and God\u2019s love] are those who are persecuted for doing that which is morally right
 for theirs is the kingdom of heaven [both now and forever].","\u201cBlessed [morally courageous and spiritually alive with life-joy in God\u2019s goodness] are you when people insult you and persecute you
 and falsely say all kinds of evil things against you because of [your association with] Me. ","Be glad and exceedingly joyful
 for your reward in heaven is great [absolutely inexhaustible]; for in this same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.","\u201cYou are the salt of the earth; but if the salt has lost its taste (purpose)
 how can it be made salty? It is no longer good for anything
 but to be thrown out and walked on by people [when the walkways are wet and slippery].","\u201cYou are the light of [Christ to] the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden;","nor does anyone light a lamp and put it under a basket
 but on a lampstand
 and it gives light to all who are in the house. ","Let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see your good deeds and moral excellence
 and [recognize and honor and] glorify your Father who is in heaven.","\u201cDo not think that I came to do away with or undo the Law [of Moses] or the [writings of the] Prophets; I did not come to destroy but to fulfill.","For I assure you and most solemnly say to you
 until heaven and earth pass away
 not the smallest letter or stroke [of the pen] will pass from the Law until all things [which it foreshadows] are accomplished. ","So whoever breaks one of the least  of these commandments
 and teaches others to do the same
 will be called least  in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever practices and teaches them
 he will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.","\u201cFor I say to you that unless your righteousness (uprightness
 moral essence) is more than that of the scribes and Pharisees
 you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.","\u201cYou have heard that it was said to the men of old
 \u2018You shall not murder
\u2019 and \u2018Whoever murders shall be guilty before the court.\u2019 ","But I say to you that everyone who continues to be angry with his brother or harbors malice against him shall be guilty before the court; and whoever speaks [contemptuously and insultingly] to his brother
 \u2018Raca (You empty-headed idiot)!\u2019 shall be guilty before the supreme court (Sanhedrin); and whoever says
 \u2018You fool!\u2019 shall be in danger of the fiery hell. ","So if you are presenting your offering at the altar
 and while there you remember that your brother has something [such as a grievance or legitimate complaint] against you
 ","leave your offering there at the altar and go. First make peace with your brother
 and then come and present your offering. ","Come to terms quickly [at the earliest opportunity] with your opponent at law while you are with him on the way [to court]
 so that your opponent does not hand you over to the judge
 and the judge to the guard
 and you are thrown into prison. ","I assure you and most solemnly say to you
 you will not come out of there until you have paid the last cent.","\u201cYou have heard that it was said
 \u2018You shall not commit adultery\u2019; ","but I say to you that everyone who [so much as] looks at a woman with lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.","If your right eye makes you stumble and leads you to sin
 tear it out and throw it away [that is
 remove yourself from the source of temptation]; for it is better for you to lose one of the parts of your body
 than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. ","If your right hand makes you stumble and leads you to sin
 cut it off and throw it away [that is
 remove yourself from the source of temptation]; for it is better for you to lose one of the parts of your body than for your whole body to go into hell.","\u201cIt has also been said
 \u2018Whoever divorces his wife is to give her a certificate of divorce\u2019; ","but I say to you that whoever divorces his wife
 except on grounds of sexual immorality
 causes her to commit adultery; and whoever marries a woman who has been divorced commits adultery.","\u201cAgain
 you have heard that it was said to the men of old
 \u2018You shall not make false vows
 but you shall fulfill your vows to the Lord [as a religious duty].\u2019 ","But I say to you
 do not make an oath at all
 either by heaven
 for it is the throne of God; ","or by the earth
 for it is the footstool of His feet; or by Jerusalem
 for it is the city of the Great King. ","Nor shall you make an oath by your head
 for you are not able to make a single hair white or black. ","But let your statement be
 \u2018Yes
 yes\u2019 or \u2018No
 no\u2019 [a firm yes or no]; anything more than that comes from the evil one.","\u201cYou have heard that it was said
 \u2018An eye for an eye
 and a tooth for a tooth [punishment that fits the offense].\u2019 ","But I say to you
 do not resist an evil person [who insults you or violates your rights]; but whoever slaps you on the right cheek
 turn the other toward him also [simply ignore insignificant insults or trivial losses and do not bother to retaliate\u2014maintain your dignity
 your self-respect
 your poise]. ","If anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt
 let him have your coat also [for the Lord repays the offender]. ","And whoever forces you to go one mile
 go with him two. ","Give to him who asks of you
 and do not turn away from him who wants to borrow from you.","\u201cYou have heard that it was said
 \u2018You shall love your neighbor (fellow man) and hate your enemy.\u2019 ","But I say to you
 love [that is
 unselfishly seek the best or higher good for] your enemies and pray for those who persecute you
 ","so that you may [show yourselves to] be the children of your Father who is in heaven; for He makes His sun rise on those who are evil and on those who are good
 and makes the rain fall on the righteous [those who are morally upright] and the unrighteous [the unrepentant
 those who oppose Him]. ","For if you love  those who love you
 what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do that? ","And if you greet only your brothers [wishing them God\u2019s blessing and peace]
 what more [than others] are you doing? Do not even the Gentiles [who do not know the Lord] do that? ","You
 therefore
 will be perfect [growing into spiritual maturity both in mind and character
 actively integrating godly values into your daily life]
 as your heavenly Father is perfect.","\u201cBe  careful not to do your good deeds publicly
 to be seen by men; otherwise you will have no reward [prepared and awaiting you] with your Father who is in heaven.","\u201cSo whenever you give to the poor and do acts of kindness
 do not blow a trumpet before you [to advertise it]
 as the hypocrites do [like actors acting out a role] in the synagogues and in the streets
 so that they may be honored and recognized and praised by men. I assure you and most solemnly say to you
 they  have their reward in full. ","But when you give to the poor and do acts of kindness
 do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing [give in complete secrecy]
 ","so that your charitable acts will be done in secret; and your Father who sees [what is done] in secret will reward you.","\u201cAlso
 when you pray
 do not be like the hypocrites; for they love to pray  standing in the synagogues and on the corners of the streets so that they may be seen by men. I assure you and most solemnly say to you
 they  have their reward in full. ","But when you pray
 go into your most private room
 close the door and pray to your Father who is in secret
 and your Father who sees [what is done] in secret will reward you.","\u201cAnd when you pray
 do not use meaningless repetition as the Gentiles do
 for they think they will be heard because of their many words. ","So do not be like them [praying as they do]; for your Father knows what you need before you ask Him.","\u201cPray
 then
 in this way: \u2018Our Father
 who is in heaven
 Hallowed be Your name."," \u2018Your kingdom come
 Your will be done On earth as it is in heaven.","\u2018Give us this day our daily bread."," \u2018And forgive us our debts
 as we have forgiven our debtors [letting go of both the wrong and the resentment]."," \u2018And do not lead us into temptation
 but deliver us from evil. [For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.]\u2019","For if you forgive others their trespasses [their reckless and willful sins]
 your heavenly Father will also forgive you. ","But if you do not forgive others [nurturing your hurt and anger with the result that it interferes with your relationship with God]
 then your Father will not forgive your trespasses.","\u201cAnd whenever you are fasting
 do not look gloomy like the hypocrites
 for they put on a sad and dismal face [like actors
 discoloring their faces with ashes or dirt] so that their fasting may be seen by men. I assure you and most solemnly say to you
 they  have their reward in full. ","But when you fast
 put oil on your head [as you normally would to groom your hair] and wash your face ","so that your fasting will not be noticed by people
 but by your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees [what is done] in secret will reward you.","\u201cDo not store up for yourselves  treasures on earth
 where moth and rust destroy
 and where thieves break in and steal. ","But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven
 where neither moth nor rust destroys
 and where thieves do not break in and steal; ","for where your treasure is
 there your heart [your wishes
 your desires; that on which your life centers] will be also.","\u201cThe eye is the lamp of the body; so if your eye is clear [spiritually perceptive]
 your whole body will be full of light [benefiting from God\u2019s precepts]. ","But if your eye is bad [spiritually blind]
 your whole body will be full of darkness [devoid of God\u2019s precepts]. So if the  light inside you [your inner self
 your heart
 your conscience] is darkness
 how great and terrible is that darkness!","\u201cNo one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other
 or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon [money
 possessions
 fame
 status
 or whatever is valued more than the Lord].","\u201cTherefore I tell you
 stop being worried or anxious (perpetually uneasy
 distracted) about your life
 as to what you will eat or what you will drink; nor about your body
 as to what you will wear. Is life not more than food
 and the body more than clothing? ","Look at the birds of the air; they neither sow  nor reap [the harvest] nor gather [the crops] into barns
 and yet your heavenly Father keeps feeding them. Are you not worth much more than they? ","And who of you by worrying can add one hour to [the length of] his life?","And why are you worried about clothes? See how the lilies and wildflowers of the field grow; they do not labor nor do they spin [wool to make clothing]
 ","yet I say to you that not even Solomon in all his glory and splendor dressed himself like one of these.","But if God so clothes the grass of the field
 which is alive and green today and tomorrow is [cut and] thrown [as fuel] into the furnace
 will He not much more clothe you? You of little faith! ","Therefore do not worry or be anxious (perpetually uneasy
 distracted)
 saying
 \u2018What are we going to eat?\u2019 or \u2018What are we going to drink?\u2019 or \u2018What are we going to wear?\u2019 ","For the  Gentiles eagerly seek all these things; [but do not worry
] for your heavenly Father knows that you need them. ","But first and most importantly seek (aim at
 strive after) His kingdom and His righteousness [His way of doing and being right\u2014the attitude and character of God]
 and all these things will be given to you also.","\u201cSo do not worry about tomorrow; for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.","\u201cDo not judge and criticize and condemn [others unfairly with an attitude of self-righteous superiority as though assuming the office of a judge]
 so that you will not be judged . ","For just as you  judge others [when you are sinful and unrepentant]
 so will you be judged; and in accordance with your standard of measure [used to pass out judgment]
 judgment will be measured to you. ","Why do you look at the  speck that is in your brother\u2019s eye
 but do not notice and acknowledge the  log that is in your own eye? ","Or how can you say to your brother
 \u2018Let me get the speck out of your eye
\u2019 when there is a log in your own eye? ","You hypocrite (play-actor
 pretender)
 first get the log out of your own eye
 and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother\u2019s eye.","\u201cDo not give that which is holy to dogs
 and do not throw your pearls before pigs
 for they will trample them under their feet
 and turn and tear you to pieces.","\u201cAsk and keep on asking and it will be given to you; seek and keep on seeking and you will find; knock and keep on knocking and the door will be opened to you.","For everyone who keeps on asking receives
 and he who keeps on seeking finds
 and to him who keeps on knocking
 it will be opened. ","Or what man is there among you who
 if his son asks for bread
 will  give him a stone? ","Or if he asks for a fish

 evil (sinful by nature) as you are
 know how to give good and advantageous gifts to your children
 how much more will your Father who is in heaven [perfect as He is] give what is good and advantageous to those who keep on asking Him.","\u201cSo then
 in everything treat others the same way you want them to treat you
 for this is [the essence of] the Law and the [writings of the] Prophets.","\u201cEnter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad and easy to travel is the path that leads the way to destruction and eternal loss
 and there are many who enter through it. ","But small is the gate and narrow and difficult to travel is the path that leads the way to  life
 and there are few who find it.","\u201cBeware of the false prophets
  who come to you dressed as sheep [appearing gentle and innocent]
 but inwardly are ravenous wolves. ","By their fruit you will recognize them [that is
 by their contrived doctrine and self-focus]. Do people pick grapes from thorn bushes or figs from thistles? ","Even so
 every healthy tree bears good fruit
 but the unhealthy tree bears bad fruit. ","A good tree cannot bear bad fruit
 nor can a bad tree bear good fruit. ","Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.","Therefore
 by their fruit you will recognize them [as false prophets].","\u201cNot everyone who says to Me
 \u2018Lord
 Lord
\u2019 will enter the kingdom of heaven
 but only he who does the will of My Father who is in heaven. ","Many will say to Me on that day [when I judge them]
 \u2018Lord
 Lord
 have we not prophesied in Your name
 and driven out demons in Your name
 and done many miracles in Your name?\u2019 ","And then I will declare to them publicly
 \u2018I never knew you; depart from Me [you are banished from My presence]
 you who act wickedly [disregarding My commands].\u2019","\u201cSo everyone who hears these words of Mine and acts on them
 will be like a wise man [a far-sighted
 practical
 and sensible man] who built his house on the rock. ","And the rain fell
 and the floods and torrents came
 and the winds blew and slammed against that house; yet it did not fall
 because it had been founded on the rock. ","And everyone who hears these words of Mine and does not do them
 will be like a foolish (stupid) man who built his house on the sand. ","And the rain fell
 and the floods and torrents came
 and the winds blew and slammed against that house; and it fell\u2014and great and complete was its fall.\u201d","Jesus reached out His hand and touched him
 saying
 \u201cI am willing; be cleansed.\u201d Immediately his leprosy was cleansed. ","And Jesus said to him
 \u201cSee that you tell no one [about this]; but go
 show yourself to the priest [for inspection] and present the offering that Moses commanded
 as a testimony (evidence) to them [of your healing].\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cI will come and heal him.\u201d ","When Jesus heard this
 He was amazed and said to those who were following Him
 \u201cI tell you truthfully
 I have not found such great faith [as this] with anyone in Israel. ","I say to you that many  will come from east and west
 and will sit down [to feast at the table
 and enjoy God\u2019s promises] with Abraham
 Isaac
 and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven [because they accepted Me as Savior]
 ","while the sons and heirs of the kingdom [the descendants of Abraham who will not recognize Me as Messiah] will be thrown out into the outer darkness; in that place [which is farthest removed from the kingdom] there will be weeping [in sorrow and pain] and grinding of teeth [in distress and anger].\u201d","Then Jesus said to the centurion
 \u201cGo; it will be done for you as you have believed.\u201d And the servant was restored to health at that very hour.","Jesus replied to him
 \u201cFoxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests

 \u201cFollow Me [believing in Me as Master and Teacher]
 and allow the  dead to bury their own dead.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cWhy are you afraid
 you men of little faith?\u201d Then He got up and rebuked the winds and the sea
 and there was [at once] a great and wonderful calm [a perfect peacefulness]. ","And He said to them
 \u201cGo!\u201d So they came out [of the men] and went into the pigs
 and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea and died in the water. ","They brought to Him a man who was paralyzed
 lying on a stretcher. Seeing their  faith [springing from confidence in Him]
 Jesus said to the paralytic
 \u201cDo not be afraid
 son; your sins are forgiven [the penalty is paid
 the guilt removed
 and you are declared to be in right standing with God].\u201d ","But Jesus
 knowing their thoughts
 said
 \u201cWhy do you think evil in your hearts? ","For which is easier
 to say
 \u2018Your sins are forgiven and the penalty paid
\u2019 or to say
 \u2018Get up and walk\u2019? [Both are possible for God; both are impossible for man.] ","But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority and the power on earth to forgive sins\u201d\u2014then He said to the paralytic
 \u201cGet up
 pick up your stretcher and go home.\u201d ","As Jesus went on from there
 He saw a man named Matthew (Levi) sitting in the tax collector\u2019s booth; and He said to him
 \u201cFollow Me [as My disciple
 accepting Me as your Master and Teacher and walking the same path of life that I walk].\u201d And Matthew got up and followed Him.","But when Jesus heard this
 He said
 \u201cThose who are healthy have no need for a physician
 but  those who are sick. ","Go and learn what this  means: \u2018I desire compassion [for those in distress]
 and not  sacrifice
\u2019 for I did not come to call [to repentance] the [self-proclaimed] righteous [who see no need to change]
 but sinners [those who recognize their sin and actively seek forgiveness].\u201d","And Jesus replied to them
 \u201cCan the guests of the bridegroom mourn while the bridegroom is with them? The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them
 and then they will fast. ","But no one puts a piece of unshrunk (new) cloth on an old garment; for the patch pulls away from the garment
 and a worse tear results. ","Nor is new wine put into old wineskins [that have lost their elasticity]; otherwise the wineskins burst
 and the  wine spills and the wineskins are ruined. But new wine is put into fresh wineskins
 so both are preserved.\u201d","But Jesus turning and seeing her said
 \u201cTake courage

 \u201cGo away; for the girl is not dead
 but is sleeping.\u201d And they laughed and jeered at Him. ","When He went into the house
 the blind men came up to Him

 abiding trust] that I am able to do this?\u201d They said to Him
 \u201cYes
 Lord.\u201d ","And their eyes were opened. And Jesus sternly warned them: \u201cSee that no one knows this!\u201d","Then He said to His disciples
 \u201cThe harvest is  plentiful

 \u2018The kingdom of heaven is at hand.\u2019 ","Heal the sick

 ask who in it is worthy [who welcomes you and your message]

 \u2018Peace be to this house\u2019]. ","If [the family living in] the house is worthy [welcoming you and your message]

 how much more [will they speak evil of] the members of his household.","\u201cSo do not be afraid of them
 for nothing is hidden that will not be revealed [at the judgment]

 that one I will also confess and acknowledge before My Father who is in heaven. ","But the one who denies and rejects Me before men
 that one I will also deny and reject before My Father who is in heaven.","\u201cDo not think that I have come to bring peace on the earth; I have not come to bring peace

 he will not lose his reward.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cGo and report to John what you hear and see: ","the blind receive  sight and the lame walk

 favored by God] is he who does not take offense at Me [accepting Me as the Messiah and trusting confidently in My message of salvation].\u201d","As these men were going away
 Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: \u201cWhat did you go out in the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind [which is commonplace]? ","What did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing [entirely unsuited for the harsh desert]? Those who wear soft clothing are in the palaces of kings!","But what did you  go out to see? A prophet? Yes
 I tell you

 \u2018Behold
 I send My messenger ahead of You
 Who will prepare Your way before You.\u2019","I assure you and most solemnly say to you
 among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater [in privilege] than he. ","From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violent assault
 and violent men seize it by force [as a precious prize]. ","For all the prophets and the Law prophesied up until John.","And if you are willing to accept it
 John himself is [the fulfillment of] Elijah [as the messenger] who was to come [before the kingdom]. ","He who has ears to hear
 let him hear and heed My words.","\u201cBut to what shall I compare this generation? It is like little children sitting in the market places
 who call to the others
 ","and say \u2018We piped the flute for you [playing wedding]
 and you did not dance; we wailed sad dirges [playing funeral]
 and you did not mourn and cry aloud.\u2019 ","For John came neither eating nor drinking [with others]
 and they say
 \u2018He has a demon!\u2019 ","The Son of Man came eating and drinking [with others]
 and they say
 \u2018Look! A glutton and a drunkard
 a friend of tax collectors and sinners [including non-observant Jews]!\u2019 Yet wisdom is justified and vindicated by her deeds [in the lives of those who respond to Me].\u201d","Then He began to denounce [the people in] the cities in which most of His miracles were done
 because they did not repent [and change their hearts and lives]. ","\u201cWoe (judgment is coming) to you
 Chorazin! Woe to you
 Bethsaida! For if the miracles done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon [cities of the Gentiles]
 they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes [their hearts would have been changed and they would have expressed sorrow for their sin and rebellion against God]. ","Nevertheless I say to you
 it will be more tolerable for [the pagan cities of] Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you. ","And you
 Capernaum
 are you to be exalted to heaven [for your apathy and unresponsiveness]? You will descend to Hades (the realm of the dead); for if the miracles done in you had been done in Sodom
 it would have remained until this day. ","But I say to you
 it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom on the day of judgment
 than for you.\u201d","At that time Jesus said
 \u201cI praise You
 Father
 Lord of heaven and earth [I openly and joyfully acknowledge Your great wisdom]
 that You have hidden these things [these spiritual truths] from the wise and intelligent and revealed them to infants [to new believers
 to those seeking God\u2019s will and purpose]. ","Yes
 Father
 for this way was well-pleasing in Your sight. ","All things have been handed over to Me by My Father; and no one fully knows and accurately understands the Son except the Father; and no one fully knows and accurately understands the Father except the Son

 all who are weary and heavily burdened [by religious rituals that provide no peace]
 and I will give you rest [refreshing your souls with salvation]. ","Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me [following Me as My disciple]

 and you will find rest (renewal
 blessed quiet) for your souls. ","For My yoke is easy [to bear] and My burden is light.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cHave you not read [in the Scriptures] what David did when he was hungry
 he and those who accompanied him\u2014 ","how he went into the house of God
 and they ate the consecrated bread
 which was not lawful for him to eat nor for those with him
 but for the priests only? ","Or have you not read in the Law
 that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple break [the sanctity of] the Sabbath and yet are innocent? ","But I tell you that something greater than the temple is here.","And if you had only known what this statement means
 \u2018I desire compassion [for those in distress]
 and not  sacrifice
\u2019 you would not have condemned the innocent.","For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.\u201d","But He said to them
 \u201cWhat man is there among you who
 if he has only one sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath
 will not take hold of it and lift it out? ","How much more valuable then is a man than a sheep! So it is lawful and permissible to do good on the Sabbath.\u201d","Then He said to the man
 \u201cReach out your hand!\u201d The man reached out and it was restored
 as normal and healthy as the other. ","Knowing their thoughts Jesus said to them
 \u201cAny kingdom that is divided against itself is being laid waste; and no city or house divided against itself will [continue to] stand. ","If Satan casts out Satan [that is
 his demons]
 he has become divided against himself and disunited; how then will his kingdom stand? ","If I cast out the demons by [the help of] Beelzebul (Satan)
 by whom do your sons drive them out? For this reason they will be your judges. ","But if it is by the Spirit of God that I cast out the demons
 then the kingdom of God has come upon you [before you expected it]. ","Or how can anyone go into a strong man\u2019s house and steal his property unless he first overpowers and ties up the strong man? Then he will ransack and rob his house.","He who is not with Me [once and for all on My side] is against Me; and he who does not  gather with Me scatters.","\u201cTherefore I say to you
 every sin and blasphemy [every evil
 abusive
 injurious speaking
 or indignity against sacred things] will be forgiven people
 but blasphemy against the  Spirit will not be forgiven. ","Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit [by attributing the miracles done by Me to Satan] will not be forgiven
 either in this age or in the age to come.","\u201cEither make the tree good and its fruit good
 or make the tree bad and its fruit bad; for the tree is recognized and judged by its fruit. ","You brood of vipers
 how can you speak good things when you are evil? For the mouth speaks out of that which fills the heart. ","The good man
 from his  good treasure
 brings out good things; and the evil man
 from his  evil treasure
 brings out evil things. ","But I tell you
 on the day of judgment people will have to give an accounting for every careless or useless word they speak. ","For by your words [reflecting your spiritual condition] you will be justified and acquitted of the guilt of sin; and by your words [rejecting Me] you will be condemned and sentenced.\u201d","But He replied and said to them
 \u201cAn evil and adulterous generation [that is morally unfaithful to God] craves and demands a  sign; but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah; ","for just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the sea monster
 so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. ","The men of Nineveh will stand up [as witnesses] at the judgment against this generation
 and will condemn it because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and now
 something greater than Jonah is here. ","The Queen of the South (Sheba) will stand up [as a witness] at the judgment against this generation
 and will condemn it because she came from the ends of the earth to listen to the wisdom of Solomon; and now
 something greater than Solomon is here.","\u201cNow when the unclean spirit has gone out of a man
 it roams through waterless (dry
 arid) places in search of rest
 but it does not find it. ","Then it says
 \u2018I will return to my house from which I came.\u2019 And when it arrives
 it finds the place unoccupied
 swept
 and put in order. ","Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself
 and they go in and make their home there. And the last condition of that man becomes worse than the first. So will it also be with this wicked generation.\u201d","While He was still talking to the crowds
 it happened that His mother and brothers stood outside
 asking to speak to Him. ","But Jesus replied to the one who told Him
 \u201cWho is My mother and who are My brothers?\u201d ","And stretching out His hand toward His disciples [and all His other followers]
 He said
 \u201cHere are My mother and My brothers! ","For whoever does the will of My Father who is in heaven [by believing in Me
 and following Me] is My brother and sister and mother.\u201d","He told them many things in parables
 saying
 \u201cListen carefully: a sower went out to sow [seed in his field]; ","and as he sowed
 some seed fell beside the road [between the fields]
 and the birds came and ate it. ","Other seed fell on rocky ground
 where they did not have much soil; and at once they sprang up because they had no depth of soil. ","But when the sun rose
 they were scorched; and because they had no root
 they withered away. ","Other seed fell among thorns
 and thorns came up and choked them out. ","Other seed fell on good soil and yielded grain
 some a hundred times as much [as was sown]
 some sixty [times as much]
 and some thirty. ","He who has ears [to hear]
 let him hear and heed My words.\u201d","Jesus replied to them
 \u201cTo you it has been granted to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven
 but to them it has not been granted. ","For whoever has [spiritual wisdom because he is receptive to God\u2019s word]
 to him more will be given
 and he will be richly and abundantly supplied; but whoever does not have [spiritual wisdom because he has devalued God\u2019s word]
 even what he has will be taken away from him. ","This is the reason I speak to the crowds in parables: because while [having the power of] seeing they do not see
 and while [having the power of] hearing they do not hear
 nor do they understand and grasp [spiritual things]. ","In them the prophecy of Isaiah is being fulfilled
 which says
 \u2018You will hear and keep on hearing
 but never understand; And you will look and keep on looking
 but never comprehend;"," For this nation\u2019s heart has grown hard
 And with their ears they hardly hear
 And they have  closed their eyes
 Otherwise they would see with their eyes
 And hear with their ears
 And understand with their heart
 and turn [to Me] And I would heal them .\u2019","But blessed [spiritually aware
 and favored by God] are your eyes
 because they see; and your ears
 because they hear. ","I assure you and most solemnly say to you
 many prophets and righteous men [who were honorable and in right standing with God] longed to see what you see
 and did not see it
 and to hear what you hear
 and did not hear it.","\u201cListen then to the [meaning of the] parable of the sower:","When anyone hears the word of the kingdom [regarding salvation] and does not understand and grasp it
 the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is the one on whom seed was sown beside the road. ","The one on whom seed was sown on rocky ground
 this is the one who hears the word and at once welcomes it with joy; ","yet he has no  root in himself
 but is only temporary
 and when pressure or persecution comes because of the word
 immediately he stumbles and falls away [abandoning the One who is the source of salvation]. ","And the one on whom seed was sown among thorns
 this is the one who hears the word
 but the worries and distractions of the world and the deceitfulness [the superficial pleasures and delight] of riches choke the word
 and it yields no fruit. ","And the one on whom seed was sown on the good soil
 this is the one who hears the word and understands and grasps it; he indeed bears fruit and yields
 some a hundred times [as much as was sown]
 some sixty [times as much]
 and some thirty.\u201d","Jesus gave them another parable [to consider]
 saying
 \u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field. ","But while his men were sleeping
 his enemy came and sowed weeds [resembling wheat] among the wheat
 and went away. ","So when the plants sprouted and formed grain
 the weeds appeared also. ","The servants of the owner came to him and said
 \u2018Sir
 did you not sow good seed in your field? Then how does it have weeds in it?\u2019 ","He replied to them
 \u2018An enemy has done this.\u2019 The servants asked him
 \u2018Then do you want us to go and pull them out?\u2019 ","But he said
 \u2018No; because as you pull out the weeds
 you may uproot the wheat with them. ","Let them grow together until the harvest; and at harvest time I will tell the reapers
 \u201cFirst gather the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; but gather the wheat into my barn.\u201d\u2019\u201d","He gave them another parable [to consider]
 saying
 \u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed
 which a man took and sowed in his field; ","and of all the seeds [planted in the region] it is the smallest
 but when it has grown it is the largest of the garden herbs and becomes a tree
 so that the birds of the air find shelter in its branches.\u201d","He told them another parable
 \u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like leaven
 which a woman took and worked into three measures of flour until all of it was leavened.\u201d","He answered
 \u201cThe one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man
 ","and the field is the world; and [as for] the good seed
 these are the sons of the kingdom; and the weeds are the sons of the evil one; ","and the enemy who sowed them is the devil
 and the harvest is the end of the age; and the reapers are angels. ","So just as the weeds are gathered up and burned in the fire
 so will it be at the end of the age. ","The Son of Man will send out His angels
 and they will gather out of His kingdom all things that offend [those things by which people are led into sin]
 and all who practice evil [leading others into sin]
 ","and will throw them into the furnace of fire; in that place there will be weeping [over sorrow and pain] and grinding of teeth [over distress and anger].","Then the righteous [those who seek the will of God] will shine forth [radiating the new life] like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears [to hear]
 let him hear and heed My words.","\u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like a [very precious] treasure hidden in a field
 which a man found and hid again; then in his joy he goes and sells all he has and buys that field [securing the treasure for himself].","\u201cAgain
 the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls
 ","and upon finding a single pearl of great value
 he went and sold all that he had and bought it.","\u201cAgain
 the kingdom of heaven is like a dragnet which was lowered into the sea
 and gathered fish of every kind
 ","and when it was full
 they dragged it up on the beach; and they sat down and sorted out the good fish into baskets
 but the worthless ones they threw away. ","So it will be at the end of the age; the angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous","and throw the wicked into the furnace of fire; in that place there will be weeping [over sorrow and pain] and grinding of teeth [over distress and anger].","\u201cHave you understood all these things [in the lessons of the parables]?\u201d They said to Jesus
 \u201cYes.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cTherefore every scribe who has become a disciple of the kingdom of heaven is like the head of a household
 who brings out of his treasure things that are new and fresh and things that are old and familiar.\u201d","And they took offense at Him [refusing to believe in Him]. But Jesus said to them
 \u201cA prophet is not without honor except in his hometown and in his own household.\u201d ","But Jesus said to them
 \u201cThey do not need to go away; you give them something to eat!\u201d ","He said
 \u201cBring them here to Me.\u201d ","But immediately He spoke to them
 saying
 \u201cTake courage
 it is I! Do not be afraid!\u201d","He said
 \u201cCome!\u201d So Peter got out of the boat
 and walked on the water and came toward Jesus. ","Immediately Jesus extended His hand and caught him
 saying to him
 \u201cO you of little faith
 why did you doubt?\u201d ","He replied to them
 \u201cWhy also do you violate the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition [handed down by the elders]? ","For God said [through Moses]
 \u2018Honor your father and mother
\u2019 and
 \u2018He who speaks evil of or insults or treats improperly father or mother is to be put to death.\u2019 ","But you say
 \u2018If anyone says to his father or mother
 \u201cWhatever [money or resource that] I have that would help you is [already dedicated and] given to God
\u201d ","he is not to honor his father or his mother [by helping them with their need].\u2019 So by this you have invalidated the word of God [depriving it of force and authority and making it of no effect] for the sake of your tradition [handed down by the elders].","You hypocrites (play-actors
 pretenders)
 rightly did Isaiah prophesy of you when he said
"," \u2018This people honors Me with their lips
 But their heart is far away from Me."," \u2018But in vain do they worship Me
 For they teach as doctrines the precepts of men.\u2019\u201d","After Jesus called the crowd to Him
 He said
 \u201cListen and understand this: ","It is not what goes into the mouth of a man that defiles and dishonors him
 but what comes out of the mouth
 this defiles and dishonors him.\u201d","He answered
 \u201cEvery plant which My heavenly Father did not plant will be torn up by the roots. ","Leave them alone; they are blind guides [leading blind followers]. If a blind man leads a blind man
 both will fall into a pit.\u201d","And He said
 \u201cAre you still so dull [and unable to put things together]? ","Do you not understand that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the stomach
 and is eliminated? ","But whatever  comes out of the mouth comes from the heart
 and this is what defiles and dishonors the man. ","For out of the heart come evil thoughts and plans
 murders
 adulteries
 sexual immoralities
 thefts
 false testimonies
 slanders (verbal abuse
 irreverent speech
 blaspheming). ","These are the things which defile and dishonor the man; but eating with  unwashed hands does not defile the man.\u201d","He answered
 \u201cI was commissioned by God and sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\u201d ","And He replied
 \u201cIt is not good (appropriate
 fair) to take the children\u2019s bread and throw it to the pet dogs.\u201d ","Then Jesus answered her
 \u201cWoman
 your faith [your personal trust and confidence in My power] is great; it will be done for you as you wish.\u201d And her daughter was healed from that moment.","Then Jesus called His disciples to Him
 and said
 \u201cI feel compassion for the crowd
 because they have been with Me now three days and have nothing  to eat; and I do not want to send them away hungry
 because they might faint [from exhaustion] on the way .\u201d ","And Jesus asked them
 \u201cHow many loaves [of bread] do you have?\u201d They replied
 \u201cSeven
 and a few small fish.\u201d ","But He replied to them
 \u201cWhen it is evening
 you say
 \u2018It will be fair weather
 for the sky is red.\u2019 ","And in the morning
 \u2018It will be stormy today
 for the sky is red and has a threatening look.\u2019 You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky
 but cannot interpret the signs of the times? ","An evil and  unfaithful generation craves a  sign; but no sign will be given to it
 except the sign of [the prophet] Jonah.\u201d Then He left them and went away.","Jesus said to them
 \u201cWatch out and be on your guard against the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\u201d ","But Jesus
 aware of this
 said
 \u201cYou men of little faith
 why are you discussing among yourselves that you have no bread? ","Do you still not understand or remember the five loaves for the five thousand
 and how many baskets you picked up? ","Or the seven loaves for the four thousand
 and how many large baskets you picked up? ","How is it that you fail to understand that I was not talking to you about bread? But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\u201d","Now when Jesus went into the region of Caesarea Philippi
 He asked His disciples
 \u201cWho do people say that the Son of Man is?\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cBut who do you say that I am?\u201d ","Then Jesus answered him
 \u201cBlessed [happy
 spiritually secure
 favored by God] are you
 Simon son of Jonah
 because flesh and blood (mortal man) did not reveal this to you
 but My Father who is in heaven. ","And I say to you that you are Peter
 and on this rock I will build My church; and the gates of Hades (death) will not overpower it [by preventing the resurrection of the Christ]. ","I will give you the keys (authority) of the kingdom of heaven; and whatever you bind [forbid
 declare to be improper and unlawful] on earth will have  been bound in heaven
 and whatever you loose [permit
 declare lawful] on earth will have  been loosed in heaven.\u201d ","But Jesus turned and said to Peter
 \u201cGet behind Me
 Satan! You are a stumbling block to Me; for you are not setting your mind on things of God
 but on things of man.\u201d","Then Jesus said to His disciples
 \u201cIf anyone wishes to follow Me [as My disciple]
 he must deny himself [set aside selfish interests]
 and take up his cross [expressing a willingness to endure whatever may come] and follow Me [believing in Me
 conforming to My example in living and
 if need be
 suffering or perhaps dying because of faith in Me]. ","For whoever wishes to save his life [in this world] will  lose it [through death]
 but whoever loses his life [in this world] for My sake will find it [that is
 life with Me for all eternity]. ","For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world [wealth
 fame
 success]
 but forfeits his soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul? ","For the Son of Man is going to come in the glory and majesty of His Father with His angels
 and then He will repay each one in accordance with what he has done.","\u201cI assure you and most solemnly say to you
 there are some of those standing here who will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom.\u201d","But Jesus came and touched them and said
 \u201cGet up
 and do not be afraid.\u201d ","And as they were going down the mountain
 Jesus commanded them
 \u201cDo not tell anyone what you have seen until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead.\u201d ","He answered and said
 \u201cElijah is coming and will restore all things; ","but I say to you that Elijah has come already
 and they did not recognize him
 but did to him as they wished. The Son of Man is also going to suffer at their hands.\u201d ","And Jesus answered
 \u201cYou unbelieving and perverted generation
 how long shall I be with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring him here to Me.\u201d ","He answered
 \u201cBecause of your little faith [your lack of trust and confidence in the power of God]; for I assure you and most solemnly say to you
 if you have  faith the size of a mustard seed
 you will say to this mountain
 \u2018Move from here to there
\u2019 and [if it is God\u2019s will] it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you. ","When they were gathering together in Galilee
 Jesus said to them
 \u201cThe Son of Man is going to be betrayed and handed over to men [who are His enemies]; ","and they will kill Him
 and He will be raised [from death to life] on the third day.\u201d And they were deeply grieved and distressed.","Peter answered
 \u201cYes.\u201d And when he came home
 Jesus spoke to him first
 saying
 \u201cWhat do you think
 Simon? From whom do earthly rulers collect duties or taxes
 from their sons or from strangers?\u201d ","When Peter said
 \u201cFrom strangers
\u201d Jesus said to him
 \u201cThen the sons are exempt [from taxation]. ","However
 so that we do not offend them
 go to the sea and throw in a hook
 and take the first fish that comes up; and when you open its mouth
 you will find a shekel. Take it and give it to them [to pay the temple tax] for you and Me.\u201d","and said
 \u201cI assure you and most solemnly say to you
 unless you repent [that is
 change your inner self\u2014your old way of thinking
 live changed lives] and become like children [trusting
 humble
 and forgiving]
 you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. ","Therefore
 whoever humbles himself like this child is greatest in the kingdom of heaven. ","Whoever receives and welcomes one child like this in My name receives Me;","but whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to stumble and sin [by leading him away from My teaching]
 it would be better for him to have a heavy millstone [as large as one turned by a donkey] hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depth of the sea.","\u201cWoe (judgment is coming) to the world because of stumbling blocks and temptations to sin! It is inevitable that stumbling blocks come; but woe to the person on whose account or through whom the stumbling block comes!","\u201cIf your hand or your foot causes you to stumble and sin
 cut it off and throw it away from you [that is
 remove yourself from the source of temptation]; it is better for you to enter life crippled or lame
 than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into everlasting fire. ","If your eye causes you to stumble and sin
 pluck it out and throw it away from you [that is
 remove yourself from the source of temptation]; it is better for you to enter life with only one eye
 than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fiery hell.","\u201cSee that you do not despise or think less of one of these little ones
 for I say to you that their angels in heaven [are in the presence of and] continually look upon the face of My Father who is in heaven. ","\u201cWhat do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep
 and one of them gets lost
 will he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountain and go in search of the one that is lost? ","And if it turns out that he finds it
 I assure you and most solemnly say to you
 he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that did not get lost. ","So it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones be lost.","\u201cIf your brother sins
 go and show him his fault in private; if he listens and pays attention to you
 you have won back your brother. ","But if he does not listen
 take along with you one or two others
 so that every word may be confirmed by the testimony of two or three witnesses. ","If he pays no attention to them [refusing to listen and obey]
 tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church
 let him be to you as a Gentile (unbeliever) and a tax collector. ","I assure you and most solemnly say to you
 whatever you bind [forbid
 declare to be improper and unlawful] on earth shall have  been bound in heaven
 and whatever you loose [permit
 declare lawful] on earth shall have  been loosed in heaven.","\u201cAgain I say to you
 that if two believers on earth agree [that is
 are of one mind
 in harmony] about anything that they ask [within the will of God]
 it will be done for them by My Father in heaven. ","For where two or three are gathered in My name [meeting together as My followers]
 I am there among them.\u201d","Jesus answered him
 \u201cI say to you
 not up to seven times
 but seventy times seven.","\u201cTherefore the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wished to settle accounts with his slaves.","When he began the accounting
 one who owed him 10
000 talents was brought to him. ","But because he could not repay
 his master ordered him to be sold
 with his wife and his children and everything that he possessed
 and payment to be made. ","So the slave fell on his knees and begged him
 saying
 \u2018Have patience with me and I will repay you everything.\u2019 ","And his master\u2019s heart was moved with compassion and he released him and forgave him  the debt.","But that same slave went out and found one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii; and he seized him and began choking him
 saying
 \u2018Pay what you owe!\u2019 ","So his fellow slave fell on his knees and begged him earnestly
 \u2018Have patience with me and I will repay you.\u2019 ","But he was unwilling and he went and had him thrown in prison until he paid back the debt.","When his fellow slaves saw what had happened
 they were deeply grieved and they went and reported to their master [with clarity and in detail] everything that had taken place. ","Then his master called him and said to him
 \u2018You wicked and contemptible slave
 I forgave all that  debt of yours because you begged me. ","Should you not have had mercy on your fellow slave [who owed you little by comparison]
 as I had mercy on you?\u2019 ","And in wrath his master turned him over to the torturers (jailers) until he paid all that he owed.","My heavenly Father will also do the same to [every one of] you
 if each of you does not forgive his brother from your heart.\u201d","He replied
 \u201cHave you never read that He who created them from the beginning made them male and female
 ","and said
 \u2018For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be joined inseparably to his wife
 and the two shall become one flesh\u2019? ","So they are no longer two
 but one flesh. Therefore
 what God has joined together
 let no one separate.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cBecause your hearts were hard and stubborn Moses permitted you to divorce your wives; but from the beginning it has not been this way. ","I say to you
 whoever divorces his wife
 except for sexual immorality
 and marries another woman commits adultery.\u201d","But He said to them
 \u201cNot all men can accept this statement
 but only those to whom [the capacity to receive] it has been given. ","For there are eunuchs who have been born that way from their mother\u2019s womb [making them incapable of consummating a marriage]; and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men [for royal service]; and there are eunuchs who have made themselves so for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. He who is able to accept this
 let him accept it.\u201d","But He said
 \u201cLeave the children alone
 and do not forbid them from coming to Me; for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cWhy are you asking Me about what is  good? There is only One who is  good; but if you wish to enter into eternal life
 keep the commandments.\u201d ","He said to Jesus
 \u201cWhich commandments?\u201d And Jesus answered
 \u201cYou shall not commit murder; You shall not commit adultery; You shall not steal; You shall not give false testimony; ","Honor your father and mother; and love your neighbor as yourself\u201d [that is
 unselfishly seek the best or higher good for others]. ","Jesus answered him
 \u201cIf you wish to be perfect [that is
 have the spiritual maturity that accompanies godly character with no moral or ethical deficiencies]
 go and sell what you have and give [the money] to the poor
 and you will have treasure in heaven; and come
 follow Me [becoming My disciple
 believing and trusting in Me and walking the same path of life that I walk].\u201d ","Jesus said to His disciples
 \u201cI assure you and most solemnly say to you
 it is difficult for a rich man [who clings to possessions and status as security] to enter the kingdom of heaven. ","Again I tell you
 it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle
 than for a rich man [who places his faith in wealth and status] to enter the kingdom of God.\u201d ","But Jesus looked at them and said
 \u201cWith people [as far as it depends on them] it is impossible
 but with God all things are possible.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cI assure you and most solemnly say to you
 in the renewal [that is
 the Messianic restoration and regeneration of all things] when the Son of Man sits on His glorious throne
 you [who have followed Me
 becoming My disciples] will also sit on twelve thrones
 judging the twelve tribes of Israel. ","And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or farms for My name\u2019s sake will receive many times as much
 and will inherit eternal life. ","But many who are first [in this world] will be last [in the world to come]; and the last
 first.","\u201cFor the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of an estate who went out in the morning at dawn to hire workmen for his vineyard.","When he had agreed with the laborers for a denarius for the day
 he sent them into his vineyard. ","And he went out about the third hour (9:00 a.m.) and saw others standing idle in the market place;","and he said to them
 \u2018You also go into the vineyard
 and I will pay you whatever is right (an appropriate wage).\u2019 And they went. ","He went out about the sixth hour (noon) and the ninth hour (3:00 p.m.)
 and did the same thing. ","And about the eleventh hour (5:00 p.m.) he went out and found others standing around
 and he said to them
 \u2018Why have you been standing here idle all day?\u2019 ","They answered him
 \u2018Because no one hired us.\u2019 He told them
 \u2018You go into the vineyard also.\u2019","\u201cWhen evening came
 the owner of the vineyard said to his manager
 \u2018Call the workers and pay them their wages
 beginning with the last [to be hired] and ending with the first [to be hired].\u2019 ","Those who had been hired at the eleventh hour (5:00 p.m.) came and received a denarius each [a day\u2019s wage].","Now when the first [to be hired] came
 they thought they would get more; but each of them also received a denarius. ","When they received it
 they protested and grumbled at the owner of the estate
 ","saying
 \u2018These men who came last worked  one hour
 and yet you have made them equal [in wages] to us who have carried [most of] the burden and [worked in] the scorching heat of the day.\u2019 ","But the owner of the estate replied to one of them
 \u2018Friend
 I am doing you no injustice. Did you not agree with me for a denarius? ","Take what belongs to you and go
 but I choose to give to this last man  the same as I give to you. ","Am I not lawfully permitted to do what I choose with what is mine? Or is your eye envious because I am generous?\u2019","So those who are last [in this world] shall be first [in the world to come]
 and those who are first
 last.\u201d","\u201cListen carefully: we are going up to Jerusalem; and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and scribes (Sanhedrin
 Jewish High Court)
 and they will  condemn Him and sentence Him to death
 ","and will hand Him over to the Gentiles (Roman authorities) to be mocked and scourged and crucified
 and He will be raised [to life] on the third day.\u201d","And He said to her
 \u201cWhat do you wish?\u201d She answered Him
 \u201cCommand that in Your kingdom these two sons of mine may sit [in positions of honor and authority] one on Your right and one on Your left.\u201d ","But Jesus replied
 \u201cYou do not realize what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup [of suffering] that I am about to drink?\u201d They answered
 \u201cWe are able.\u201d ","But Jesus called them to Himself and said
 \u201cYou know that the rulers of the Gentiles have absolute power and lord it over them
 and their great men exercise authority over them [tyrannizing them]. ","It is not this way among you
 but whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your servant
 ","and whoever wishes to be first among you shall be your [willing and humble] slave;","just as the Son of Man did not come to be served
 but to serve
 and to give His life as a ransom for many [paying the price to set them free from the penalty of sin].\u201d","Jesus stopped and called them
 and asked
 \u201cWhat do you want Me to do for you?\u201d ","saying to them
 \u201cGo into the village opposite you
 and at once you will find a donkey tied
 and a colt with her; untie them and bring them to Me. ","If anyone says anything to you
 you should say
 \u2018The Lord needs them
\u2019 and without delay the owner will send them [with you].\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cIt is written [in Scripture]
 \u2018My house shall be called a house of prayer\u2019; but you are making it a robbers\u2019 den.\u201d","and they said to Him
 \u201cDo You hear what these children are saying?\u201d And Jesus replied to them
 \u201cYes; have you never read [in the Scripture]
 \u2018Out of the mouths of infants and nursing babies You have prepared and provided praise for Yourself\u2019?\u201d ","Seeing a lone fig tree at the roadside
 He went to it and found nothing but leaves on it; and He said to it
 \u201cNever again will fruit come from you.\u201d And at once the fig tree withered.","Jesus replied to them
 \u201cI assure you and most solemnly say to you

\u2019 it will happen [if God wills it]. ","And whatever you ask for in prayer
 believing
 you will receive.\u201d","Jesus replied to them

 \u2018From heaven
\u2019 He will say to us
 \u2018Then why did you not believe John?\u2019 ","So they answered Jesus
 \u201cWe do not know.\u201d And He said to them
 \u201cNeither will I tell you by what [kind of] authority I do these things.\u201d","\u201cWhat do you think? There was a man who had two sons

 did not even change your mind afterward and believe him [accepting what he proclaimed to you].","\u201cListen to another parable. There was a landowner who planted a vineyard and put a wall around it and dug a wine press in it
 and built a tower
 and rented it out to tenant farmers and went on a journey [to another country]. ","When the harvest time approached
 he sent his servants to the tenants to get his [share of the] fruit. ","But the tenants took his servants and beat one
 and killed another
 and stoned a third. ","Again he sent other servants
 more than the first time; and they treated them the same way. ","Finally he sent his own son to them

 they said to themselves
 \u2018This  is the heir; come on
 let us kill him and seize his inheritance.\u2019 ","So they took the son and threw him out of the vineyard

 there the vultures will flock together.","\u201cImmediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened

 until the  day when Noah entered the ark
 ","and they did not know or understand until the flood came and swept them all away; so will the coming of the Son of Man be [unexpected judgment].","At that time two men will be in the field; one will be taken [for judgment] and one will be left.","Two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken [for judgment] and one will be left.","\u201cSo be alert [give strict attention
 be cautious and active in faith]
 for you do not know which day [whether near or far] your Lord is coming. ","But understand this: If the head of the house had known what time of the night the thief was coming
 he would have been on the alert and would not have allowed his house to be broken into. ","Therefore
 you [who follow Me] must also be ready; because the Son of Man is coming at an hour when you do not expect Him.","\u201cWho then is the faithful and wise servant whom his master has put in charge of his household to give the others [in the house] their food and supplies at the proper time?","Blessed is that  servant when his master returns and finds him doing so.","I assure you and most solemnly say to you that he will put him in charge of all his possessions.","But if that servant is evil and says in his heart
 \u2018My master is taking his time [he will not return for a long while]
\u2019 ","and begins to beat his fellow servants and to eat and drink with drunkards;","the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour of which he is not aware

 who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom. ","Five of them were foolish [thoughtless
 silly
 and careless]
 and five were wise [far-sighted
 practical
 and sensible]. ","For when the foolish took their lamps
 they did not take any  oil with them
 ","but the wise took flasks of oil along with their lamps.","Now while the bridegroom was delayed
 they all began to nod off
 and they fell asleep. ","But at midnight there was a shout
 \u2018Look! The bridegroom [is coming]! Go out to meet him.\u2019 ","Then all those virgins got up and put their own lamps in order [trimmed the wicks and added oil and lit them].","But the foolish virgins said to the wise
 \u2018Give us some of your oil

 the bridegroom came

 be on the alert [be prepared and ready]

 and he called his servants together and entrusted them with his possessions. ","To one he gave five talents
 to another
 two

 one

 saying
 \u2018Master
 I knew you to be a harsh and demanding man
 reaping [the harvest] where you did not sow and gathering where you did not scatter seed. ","So I was afraid [to lose the talent]
 and I went and hid your talent in the ground. See
 you have what is your own.\u2019","\u201cBut his master answered him
 \u2018You wicked
 lazy servant
 you knew that I reap [the harvest] where I did not sow and gather where I did not scatter seed. ","Then you ought to have put my money with the bankers
 and at my return I would have received my money back with interest. ","So take the talent away from him
 and give it to the one who has the ten talents.\u2019","\u201cFor to everyone who has [and values his blessings and gifts from God
 and has used them wisely]
 more will be given
 and [he will be richly supplied so that] he will have an abundance; but from the one who does not have [because he has ignored or disregarded his blessings and gifts from God]
 even what he does have will be taken away. ","And throw out the worthless servant into the outer darkness; in that place [of grief and torment] there will be weeping [over sorrow and pain] and grinding of teeth [over distress and anger].","\u201cBut when the Son of Man comes in His glory and majesty and all the angels with Him
 then He will sit on the throne of His glory. ","All the nations will be gathered before Him [for judgment]; and He will separate them from one another
 as a shepherd separates his sheep from the goats; ","and He will put the sheep on His right [the place of honor]
 and the goats on His left [the place of rejection].","\u201cThen the King will say to those on His right
 \u2018Come

 appointed to eternal salvation]

 \u2018Leave Me

 You cursed fool! [You empty-headed idiot!] shall be liable to and unable to escape the hell (Gehenna) of fire.","So if when you are offering your gift at the altar you there remember that your brother has any [grievance] against you
","Leave your gift at the altar and go. First make peace with your brother
 and then come back and present your gift.","Come to terms quickly with your accuser while you are on the way traveling with him
 lest your accuser hand you over to the judge
 and the judge to the guard
 and you be put in prison.","Truly I say to you
 you will not be released until you have paid the last fraction of a penny.","You have heard that it was said
 You shall not commit adultery.","But I say to you that everyone who so much as looks at a woman with evil desire for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.","If your right eye serves as a trap to ensnare you or is an occasion for you to stumble and sin
 pluck it out and throw it away. It is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body be cast into hell (Gehenna).","And if your right hand serves as a trap to ensnare you or is an occasion for you to stumble and sin
 cut it off and cast it from you. It is better that you lose one of your members than that your entire body should be cast into hell (Gehenna).","It has also been said
 Whoever divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce.","But I tell you
 Whoever dismisses and repudiates and divorces his wife
 except on the grounds of unfaithfulness (sexual immorality)
 causes her to commit adultery
 and whoever marries a woman who has been divorced commits adultery.","Again
 you have heard that it was said to the men of old
 You shall not swear falsely
 but you shall perform your oaths to the Lord [as a religious duty].","But I tell you
 Do not bind yourselves by an oath at all: either by heaven
 for it is the throne of God;","Or by the earth
 for it is the footstool of His feet; or by Jerusalem
 for it is the city of the Great King.","And do not swear by your head
 for you are not able to make a single hair white or black.","Let your Yes be simply Yes
 and your No be simply No; anything more than that comes from the evil one.","You have heard that it was said
 An eye for an eye
 and a tooth for a tooth.","But I say to you
 Do not resist the evil man [who injures you]; but if anyone strikes you on the right jaw or cheek
 turn to him the other one too.","And if anyone wants to sue you and take your undershirt (tunic)
 let him have your coat also.","And if anyone forces you to go one mile
 go with him two [miles].","Give to him who keeps on begging from you
 and do not turn away from him who would borrow [at interest] from you.","You have heard that it was said
 You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy;","But I tell you
 Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you
","To show that you are the children of your Father Who is in heaven; for He makes His sun rise on the wicked and on the good
 and makes the rain fall upon the upright and the wrongdoers [alike].","For if you love those who love you
 what reward can you have? Do not even the tax collectors do that?","And if you greet only your brethren
 what more than others are you doing? Do not even the Gentiles (the heathen) do that?","You
 therefore
 must be perfect [growing into complete maturity of godliness in mind and character
 having reached the proper height of virtue and integrity]
 as your heavenly Father is perfect.","Take care not to do your good deeds publicly or before men
 in order to be seen by them; otherwise you will have no reward [reserved for and awaiting you] with and from your Father Who is in heaven.","Thus
 whenever you give to the poor
 do not blow a trumpet before you
 as the hypocrites in the synagogues and in the streets like to do
 that they may be recognized and honored and praised by men. Truly I tell you
 they have their reward in full already.","But when you give to charity
 do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing
","So that your deeds of charity may be in secret; and your Father Who sees in secret will reward you openly.","Also when you pray
 you must not be like the hypocrites
 for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the corners of the streets
 that they may be seen by people. Truly I tell you
 they have their reward in full already.","But when you pray
 go into your [most] private room
 and
 closing the door
 pray to your Father
 Who is in secret; and your Father
 Who sees in secret
 will reward you in the open.","And when you pray
 do not heap up phrases (multiply words
 repeating the same ones over and over) as the Gentiles do
 for they think they will be heard for their much speaking.","Do not be like them
 for your Father knows what you need before you ask Him.","Pray
 therefore
 like this: Our Father Who is in heaven
 hallowed (kept holy) be Your name.","Your kingdom come
 Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.","Give us this day our daily bread.","And forgive us our debts
 as we also have forgiven (left
 remitted
 and let go of the debts
 and have given up resentment against) our debtors.","And lead (bring) us not into temptation
 but deliver us from the evil one. For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.","For if you forgive people their trespasses [their reckless and willful sins
 leaving them
 letting them go
 and giving up resentment]
 your heavenly Father will also forgive you.","But if you do not forgive others their trespasses [their reckless and willful sins
 leaving them
 letting them go
 and giving up resentment]
 neither will your Father forgive you your trespasses.","And whenever you are fasting
 do not look gloomy and sour and dreary like the hypocrites
 for they put on a dismal countenance
 that their fasting may be apparent to and seen by men. Truly I say to you
 they have their reward in full already.","But when you fast
 perfume your head and wash your face
","So that your fasting may not be noticed by men but by your Father
 Who sees in secret; and your Father
 Who sees in secret
 will reward you in the open.","Do not gather and heap up and store up for yourselves treasures on earth
 where moth and rust and worm consume and destroy
 and where thieves break through and steal.","But gather and heap up and store for yourselves treasures in heaven
 where neither moth nor rust nor worm consume and destroy
 and where thieves do not break through and steal;","For where your treasure is
 there will your heart be also.","The eye is the lamp of the body. So if your eye is sound
 your entire body will be full of light.","But if your eye is unsound
 your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the very light in you [your conscience] is darkened
 how dense is that darkness!","No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other
 or he will stand by and be devoted to the one and despise and be against the other. You cannot serve God and mammon (deceitful riches
 money
 possessions
 or whatever is trusted in).","Therefore I tell you
 stop being perpetually uneasy (anxious and worried) about your life
 what you shall eat or what you shall drink; or about your body
 what you shall put on. Is not life greater [in quality] than food
 and the body [far above and more excellent] than clothing?","Look at the birds of the air; they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns
 and yet your heavenly Father keeps feeding them. Are you not worth much more than they?","And who of you by worrying and being anxious can add one unit of measure (cubit) to his stature or to the span of his life?","And why should you be anxious about clothes? Consider the lilies of the field and learn thoroughly how they grow; they neither toil nor spin.","Yet I tell you
 even Solomon in all his magnificence (excellence
 dignity
 and grace) was not arrayed like one of these.","But if God so clothes the grass of the field
 which today is alive and green and tomorrow is tossed into the furnace
 will He not much more surely clothe you
 O you of little faith?","Therefore do not worry and be anxious
 saying
 What are we going to have to eat? or
 What are we going to have to drink? or
 What are we going to have to wear?","For the Gentiles (heathen) wish for and crave and diligently seek all these things
 and your heavenly Father knows well that you need them all.","But seek (aim at and strive after) first of all His kingdom and His righteousness (His way of doing and being right)
 and then all these things taken together will be given you besides.","So do not worry or be anxious about tomorrow
 for tomorrow will have worries and anxieties of its own. Sufficient for each day is its own trouble.","Do not judge and criticize and condemn others
 so that you may not be judged and criticized and condemned yourselves.","For just as you judge and criticize and condemn others
 you will be judged and criticized and condemned
 and in accordance with the measure you [use to] deal out to others
 it will be dealt out again to you.","Why do you stare from without at the very small particle that is in your brother\u2019s eye but do not become aware of and consider the beam of timber that is in your own eye?","Or how can you say to your brother
 Let me get the tiny particle out of your eye
 when there is the beam of timber in your own eye?","You hypocrite
 first get the beam of timber out of your own eye
 and then you will see clearly to take the tiny particle out of your brother\u2019s eye.","Do not give that which is holy (the sacred thing) to the dogs
 and do not throw your pearls before hogs
 lest they trample upon them with their feet and turn and tear you in pieces.","Keep on asking and it will be given you;  keep on seeking and you will find; keep on knocking [reverently] and [the door] will be opened to you.","For everyone who keeps on asking receives; and he who keeps on seeking finds; and to him who keeps on knocking
 [the door] will be opened.","Or what man is there of you
 if his son asks him for a loaf of bread
 will hand him a stone?","Or if he asks for a fish
 will hand him a serpent?","If you then
 evil as you are
 know how to give good and advantageous gifts to your children
 how much more will your Father Who is in heaven [perfect as He is] give good and advantageous things to those who keep on asking Him!","So then
 whatever you desire that others would do to and for you
 even so do also to and for them
 for this is (sums up) the Law and the Prophets.","Enter through the narrow gate; for wide is the gate and spacious and broad is the way that leads away to destruction
 and many are those who are entering through it.","But the gate is narrow (contracted by pressure) and the way is straitened and compressed that leads away to life
 and few are those who find it.","Beware of false prophets
 who come to you dressed as sheep
 but inside they are devouring wolves.","You will fully recognize them by their fruits. Do people pick grapes from thorns
 or figs from thistles?","Even so
 every healthy (sound) tree bears good fruit [worthy of admiration]
 but the sickly (decaying
 worthless) tree bears bad (worthless) fruit.","A good (healthy) tree cannot bear bad (worthless) fruit
 nor can a bad (diseased) tree bear excellent fruit [worthy of admiration].","Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire.","Therefore
 you will fully know them by their fruits.","Not everyone who says to Me
 Lord
 Lord
 will enter the kingdom of heaven
 but he who does the will of My Father Who is in heaven.","Many will say to Me on that day
 Lord
 Lord
 have we not prophesied in Your name and driven out demons in Your name and done many mighty works in Your name?","And then I will say to them openly (publicly)
 I never knew you; depart from Me
 you who act wickedly [disregarding My commands].","So everyone who hears these words of Mine and acts upon them [obeying them] will be like a sensible (prudent
 practical
 wise) man who built his house upon the rock.","And the rain fell and the floods came and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall
 because it had been founded on the rock.","And everyone who hears these words of Mine and does not do them will be like a stupid (foolish) man who built his house upon the sand.","And the rain fell and the floods came and the winds blew and beat against that house
 and it fell\u2014and great and complete was the fall of it.","And He reached out His hand and touched him
 saying
 I am willing; be cleansed by being cured. And instantly his leprosy was cured and cleansed.","And Jesus said to him
 See that you tell nothing about this to anyone; but go
 show yourself to the priest and present the offering that Moses commanded
 for a testimony [to your healing] and as an evidence to the people.","And Jesus said to him
 I will come and restore him.","When Jesus heard him
 He marveled and said to those who followed Him [who adhered steadfastly to Him
 conforming to His example in living and
 if need be
 in dying also]
 I tell you truly
 I have not found so much faith as this with anyone
 even in Israel.","I tell you
 many will come from east and west
 and will sit at table with Abraham
 Isaac
 and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven
","While the sons and heirs of the kingdom will be driven out into the darkness outside
 where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.","Then to the centurion Jesus said
 Go; it shall be done for you as you have believed. And the servant boy was restored to health at that very moment.","And Jesus replied to him
 Foxes have holes and the birds of the air have lodging places
 but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head.","But Jesus said to him
 Follow Me
 and leave the dead [in sin] to bury their own dead.","And He said to them
 Why are you timid and afraid
 O you of little faith? Then He got up and rebuked the winds and the sea
 and there was a great and wonderful calm (a perfect peaceableness).","And He said to them
 Begone! So they came out and went into the hogs
 and behold
 the whole drove rushed down the steep bank into the sea and died in the water.","And behold
 they brought to Him a man paralyzed and prostrated by illness
 lying on a sleeping pad; and when Jesus saw their faith
 He said to the paralyzed man
 Take courage
 son; your sins are forgiven and the penalty remitted.","But Jesus
 knowing (seeing) their thoughts
 said
 Why do you think evil and harbor malice in your hearts?","For which is easier: to say
 Your sins are forgiven and the penalty remitted
 or to say
 Get up and walk?","But in order that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins and remit the penalty
 He then said to the paralyzed man
 Get up! Pick up your sleeping pad and go to your own house.","As Jesus passed on from there
 He saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector\u2019s office; and He said to him
 Be My disciple [side with My party and follow Me]. And he rose and followed Him.","But when Jesus heard it
 He replied
 Those who are strong and well (healthy) have no need of a physician
 but those who are weak and sick.","Go and learn what this means: I desire mercy [that is
 readiness to help those in trouble] and not sacrifice and sacrificial victims. For I came not to call and invite [to repentance] the righteous (those who are upright and in right standing with God)
 but sinners (the erring ones and all those not free from sin).","And Jesus replied to them
 Can the wedding guests mourn while the bridegroom is still with them? The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them
 and then they will fast.","And no one puts a piece of cloth that has not been shrunk on an old garment
 for such a patch tears away from the garment and a worse rent (tear) is made.","Neither is new wine put in old wineskins; for if it is
 the skins burst and are torn in pieces
 and the wine is spilled and the skins are ruined. But new wine is put into fresh wineskins
 and so both are preserved.","Jesus turned around and
 seeing her
 He said
 Take courage
 daughter! Your faith has made you well. And at once the woman was restored to health.","He said
 Go away; for the girl is not dead but sleeping. And they laughed and jeered at Him.","When He reached the house and went in
 the blind men came to Him
 and Jesus said to them
 Do you believe that I am able to do this? They said to Him
 Yes
 Lord.","And their eyes were opened. And Jesus earnestly and sternly charged them
 See that you let no one know about this.","Then He said to His disciples
 The harvest is indeed plentiful
 but the laborers are few.","So pray to the Lord of the harvest to force out and thrust laborers into His harvest.","Jesus sent out these twelve
 charging them
 Go nowhere among the Gentiles and do not go into any town of the Samaritans;","But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.","And as you go
 preach
 saying
 The kingdom of heaven is at hand!","Cure the sick
 raise the dead
 cleanse the lepers
 drive out demons. Freely (without pay) you have received
 freely (without charge) give.","Take no gold nor silver nor [even] copper money in your purses (belts);","And do not take a provision bag or a wallet for a collection bag for your journey
 nor two undergarments
 nor sandals
 nor a staff; for the workman deserves his support (his living
 his food).","And into whatever town or village you go
 inquire who in it is deserving
 and stay there [at his house] until you leave [that vicinity].","As you go into the house
 give your greetings and wish it well.","Then if indeed that house is deserving
 let come upon it your peace [that is
 freedom from all the distresses that are experienced as the result of sin]. But if it is not deserving
 let your peace return to you.","And whoever will not receive and accept and welcome you nor listen to your message
 as you leave that house or town
 shake the dust [of it] from your feet.","Truly I tell you
 it shall be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah than for that town.","Behold
 I am sending you out like sheep in the midst of wolves; be wary and wise as serpents
 and be innocent (harmless
 guileless
 and without falsity) as doves.","Be on guard against men [whose way or nature is to act in opposition to God]; for they will deliver you up to councils and flog you in their synagogues
","And you will be brought before governors and kings for My sake
 as a witness to bear testimony before them and to the Gentiles (the nations).","But when they deliver you up
 do not be anxious about how or what you are to speak; for what you are to say will be given you in that very hour and moment
","For it is not you who are speaking
 but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.","Brother will deliver up brother to death
 and the father his child; and children will take a stand against their parents and will have them put to death.","And you will be hated by all for My name\u2019s sake
 but he who perseveres and endures to the end will be saved [from spiritual disease and death in the world to come].","When they persecute you in one town [that is
 pursue you in a manner that would injure you and cause you to suffer because of your belief]
 flee to another town; for truly I tell you
 you will not have gone through all the towns of Israel before  the Son of Man comes.","A disciple is not above his teacher
 nor is a servant or slave above his master.","It is sufficient for the disciple to be like his teacher
 and the servant or slave like his master. If they have called the Master of the house Beelzebub [master of the dwelling]
 how much more will they speak evil of those of His household.","So have no fear of them; for nothing is concealed that will not be revealed
 or kept secret that will not become known.","What I say to you in the dark
 tell in the light; and what you hear whispered in the ear
 proclaim upon the housetops.","And do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; but rather be afraid of Him who can destroy both soul and body in hell (Gehenna).","Are not two little sparrows sold for a penny? And yet not one of them will fall to the ground without your Father\u2019s leave (consent) and notice.","But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered.","Fear not
 then; you are of more value than many sparrows.","Therefore
 everyone who acknowledges Me before men and confesses Me [out of a state of oneness with Me]
 I will also acknowledge him before My Father Who is in heaven and confess [that I am abiding in] him.","But whoever denies and disowns Me before men
 I also will deny and disown him before My Father Who is in heaven.","Do not think that I have come to bring peace upon the earth; I have not come to bring peace
 but a sword.","For I have come to part asunder a man from his father
 and a daughter from her mother
 and a newly married wife from her mother-in-law\u2014","And a man\u2019s foes will be they of his own household.","He who loves [and takes more pleasure in] father or mother more than [in] Me is not worthy of Me; and he who loves [and takes more pleasure in] son or daughter more than [in] Me is not worthy of Me;","And he who does not take up his cross and follow Me [cleave steadfastly to Me
 conforming wholly to My example in living and
 if need be
 in dying also] is not worthy of Me.","Whoever finds his [lower] life will lose it [the higher life]
 and whoever loses his [lower] life on My account will find it [the higher life].","He who receives and welcomes and accepts you receives and welcomes and accepts Me
 and he who receives and welcomes and accepts Me receives and welcomes and accepts Him Who sent Me.","He who receives and welcomes and accepts a prophet because he is a prophet shall receive a prophet\u2019s reward
 and he who receives and welcomes and accepts a righteous man because he is a righteous man shall receive a righteous man\u2019s reward.","And whoever gives to one of these little ones [in rank or influence] even a cup of cold water because he is My disciple
 surely I declare to you
 he shall not lose his reward.","And Jesus replied to them
 Go and report to John what you hear and see:","The blind receive their sight and the lame walk
 lepers are cleansed (by healing) and the deaf hear
 the dead are raised up and the poor have good news (the Gospel) preached to them.","And blessed (happy
 fortunate
 and to be envied) is he who takes no offense at Me and finds no cause for stumbling in or through Me and is not hindered from seeing the Truth.","Then as these men went their way
 Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: What did you go out in the wilderness (desert) to see? A reed swayed by the wind?","What did you go out to see then? A man clothed in soft garments? Behold
 those who wear soft clothing are in the houses of kings.","But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes
 I tell you
 and one [out of the common
 more eminent
 more remarkable
 and] superior to a prophet.","This is the one of whom it is written
 Behold
 I send My messenger ahead of You
 who shall make ready Your way before You.","Truly I tell you
 among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.","And from the days of John the Baptist until the present time
 the kingdom of heaven has endured violent assault
 and violent men seize it by force [as a precious prize\u2014a share in the heavenly kingdom is sought with most ardent zeal and intense exertion].","For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied up until John.","And if you are willing to receive and accept it
 John himself is Elijah who was to come [before the kingdom].","He who has ears to hear
 let him be listening and let him consider and perceive and comprehend by hearing.","But to what shall I liken this generation? It is like little children sitting in the marketplaces who call to their playmates
","We piped to you [playing wedding]
 and you did not dance; we wailed dirges [playing funeral]
 and you did not mourn and beat your breasts and weep aloud.","For John came neither eating nor drinking [with others]
 and they say
 He has a demon!","The Son of Man came eating and drinking [with others]
 and they say
 Behold
 a glutton and a wine drinker
 a friend of tax collectors and [especially wicked] sinners! Yet wisdom is justified and vindicated by what she does (her deeds) and by her children.","Then He began to censure and reproach the cities in which most of His mighty works had been performed
 because they did not repent [and their hearts were not changed].","Woe to you
 Chorazin! Woe to you
 Bethsaida! For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon
 they would long ago have repented in sackcloth and ashes [and their hearts would have been changed].","I tell you [further]
 it shall be more endurable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.","And you
 Capernaum
 are you to be lifted up to heaven? You shall be brought down to Hades [the region of the dead]! For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Sodom
 it would have continued until today.","But I tell you
 it shall be more endurable for the land of Sodom on the day of judgment than for you.","At that time Jesus began to say
 I thank You
 Father
 Lord of heaven and earth [and I acknowledge openly and joyfully to Your honor]
 that You have hidden these things from the wise and clever and learned
 and revealed them to babies [to the childish
 untaught
 and unskilled].","Yes
 Father
 [I praise You that] such was Your gracious will and good pleasure.","All things have been entrusted and delivered to Me by My Father; and no one fully knows and accurately understands the Son except the Father
 and no one fully knows and accurately understands the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son deliberately wills to make Him known.","Come to Me
 all you who labor and are heavy-laden and overburdened
 and I will cause you to rest. [I will ease and relieve and refresh your souls.]","Take My yoke upon you and learn of Me
 for I am gentle (meek) and humble (lowly) in heart
 and you will find rest (relief and ease and refreshment and recreation and blessed quiet) for your souls.","For My yoke is wholesome (useful
 good\u2014not harsh
 hard
 sharp
 or pressing
 but comfortable
 gracious
 and pleasant)
 and My burden is light and easy to be borne.","He said to them
 Have you not even read what David did when he was hungry
 and those who accompanied him\u2014","How he went into the house of God and ate the loaves of the showbread\u2014which was not lawful for him to eat
 nor for the men who accompanied him
 but for the priests only?","Or have you never read in the Law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple violate the sanctity of the Sabbath [breaking it] and yet are guiltless?","But I tell you
 Something greater and more exalted and more majestic than the temple is here!","And if you had only known what this saying means
 I desire mercy [readiness to help
 to spare
 to forgive] rather than sacrifice and sacrificial victims
 you would not have condemned the guiltless.","For the Son of Man is Lord [even] of the Sabbath.","But He said to them
 What man is there among you
 if he has only one sheep and it falls into a pit or ditch on the Sabbath
 will not take hold of it and lift it out?","How much better and of more value is a man than a sheep! So it is lawful and allowable to do good on the Sabbath days.","Then He said to the man
 Reach out your hand. And the man reached it out and it was restored
 as sound as the other one.","And knowing their thoughts
 He said to them
 Any kingdom that is divided against itself is being brought to desolation and laid waste
 and no city or house divided against itself will last or continue to stand.","And if Satan drives out Satan
 he has become divided against himself and disunified; how then will his kingdom last or continue to stand?","And if I drive out the demons by [help of] Beelzebub
 by whose [help] do your sons drive them out? For this reason they shall be your judges.","But if it is by the Spirit of God that I drive out the demons
 then the kingdom of God has come upon you [before you expected it].","Or how can a person go into a strong man\u2019s house and carry off his goods (the entire equipment of his house) without first binding the strong man? Then indeed he may plunder his house.","He who is not with Me [definitely on My side] is against Me
 and he who does not [definitely] gather with Me and for My side scatters.","Therefore I tell you
 every sin and blasphemy (every evil
 abusive
 injurious speaking
 or indignity against sacred things) can be forgiven men
 but blasphemy against the [Holy] Spirit shall not and cannot be forgiven.","And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven
 but whoever speaks against the Spirit
 the Holy One
 will not be forgiven
 either in this world and age or in the world and age to come.","Either make the tree sound (healthy and good)
 and its fruit sound (healthy and good)
 or make the tree rotten (diseased and bad)
 and its fruit rotten (diseased and bad); for the tree is known and recognized and judged by its fruit.","You offspring of vipers! How can you speak good things when you are evil (wicked)? For out of the fullness (the overflow
 the superabundance) of the heart the mouth speaks.","The good man from his inner good treasure flings forth good things
 and the evil man out of his inner evil storehouse flings forth evil things.","But I tell you
 on the day of judgment men will have to give account for every idle (inoperative
 nonworking) word they speak.","For by your words you will be justified and acquitted
 and by your words you will be condemned and sentenced.","But He replied to them
 An evil and adulterous generation (a generation morally unfaithful to God) seeks and demands a sign; but no sign shall be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.","For even as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the sea monster
 so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.","The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah
 and behold
 Someone more and greater than Jonah is here!","The queen of the South will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to the wisdom of Solomon
 and behold
 Someone more and greater than Solomon is here.","But when the unclean spirit has gone out of a man
 it roams through dry [arid] places in search of rest
 but it does not find any.","Then it says
 I will go back to my house from which I came out. And when it arrives
 it finds the place unoccupied
 swept
 put in order
 and decorated.","Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself
 and they go in and make their home there. And the last condition of that man becomes worse than the first. So also shall it be with this wicked generation.","Jesus was still speaking to the people when behold
 His mother and brothers stood outside
 seeking to speak to Him.","But He replied to the man who told Him
 Who is My mother
 and who are My brothers?","And stretching out His hand toward [not only the twelve disciples but all] His adherents
 He said
 Here are My mother and My brothers.","For whoever does the will of My Father in heaven is My brother and sister and mother!","And He told them many things in parables (stories by way of illustration and comparison)
 saying
 A sower went out to sow.","And as he sowed
 some seeds fell by the roadside
 and the birds came and ate them up.","Other seeds fell on rocky ground
 where they had not much soil; and at once they sprang up
 because they had no depth of soil.","But when the sun rose
 they were scorched
 and because they had no root
 they dried up and withered away.","Other seeds fell among thorns
 and the thorns grew up and choked them out.","Other seeds fell on good soil
 and yielded grain\u2014some a hundred times as much as was sown
 some sixty times as much
 and some thirty.","He who has ears [to hear]
 let him be listening and let him consider and perceive and comprehend by hearing.","And He replied to them
 To you it has been given to know the secrets and mysteries of the kingdom of heaven
 but to them it has not been given.","For whoever has [spiritual knowledge]
 to him will more be given and he will be furnished richly so that he will have abundance; but from him who has not
 even what he has will be taken away.","This is the reason that I speak to them in parables: because having the power of seeing
 they do not see; and having the power of hearing
 they do not hear
 nor do they grasp and understand.","In them indeed is the process of fulfillment of the prophecy of Isaiah
 which says: You shall indeed hear and hear but never grasp and understand; and you shall indeed look and look but never see and perceive.","For this nation\u2019s heart has grown gross (fat and dull)
 and their ears heavy and difficult of hearing
 and their eyes they have tightly closed
 lest they see and perceive with their eyes
 and hear and comprehend the sense with their ears
 and grasp and understand with their heart
 and turn and I should heal them.","But blessed (happy
 fortunate
 and to be envied) are your eyes because they do see
 and your ears because they do hear.","Truly I tell you
 many prophets and righteous men [men who were upright and in right standing with God] yearned to see what you see
 and did not see it
 and to hear what you hear
 and did not hear it.","Listen then to the [meaning of the] parable of the sower:","While anyone is hearing the Word of the kingdom and does not grasp and comprehend it
 the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is what was sown along the roadside.","As for what was sown on thin (rocky) soil
 this is he who hears the Word and at once welcomes and accepts it with joy;","Yet it has no real root in him
 but is temporary (inconstant
 lasts but a little while); and when affliction or trouble or persecution comes on account of the Word
 at once he is caused to stumble [he is repelled and begins to distrust and desert Him Whom he ought to trust and obey] and he falls away.","As for what was sown among thorns
 this is he who hears the Word
 but the cares of the world and the pleasure and delight and glamour and deceitfulness of riches choke and suffocate the Word
 and it yields no fruit.","As for what was sown on good soil
 this is he who hears the Word and grasps and comprehends it; he indeed bears fruit and yields in one case a hundred times as much as was sown
 in another sixty times as much
 and in another thirty.","Another parable He set forth before them
 saying
 The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.","But while he was sleeping
 his enemy came and sowed also darnel (weeds resembling wheat) among the wheat
 and went on his way.","So when the plants sprouted and formed grain
 the darnel (weeds) appeared also.","And the servants of the owner came to him and said
 Sir
 did you not sow good seed in your field? Then how does it have darnel shoots in it?","He replied to them
 An enemy has done this. The servants said to him
 Then do you want us to go and weed them out?","But he said
 No
 lest in gathering the wild wheat (weeds resembling wheat)
 you root up the [true] wheat along with it.","Let them grow together until the harvest; and at harvest time I will say to the reapers
 Gather the darnel first and bind it in bundles to be burned
 but gather the wheat into my granary.","Another story by way of comparison He set forth before them
 saying
 The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed
 which a man took and sowed in his field.","Of all the seeds it is the smallest
 but when it has grown it is the largest of the garden herbs and becomes a tree
 so that the birds of the air come and find shelter in its branches.","He told them another parable: The kingdom of heaven is like leaven (sour dough) which a woman took and covered over in three measures of meal or flour till all of it was leavened.","He answered
 He Who sows the good seed is the Son of Man.","The field is the world
 and the good seed means the children of the kingdom; the darnel is the children of the evil one
","And the enemy who sowed it is the devil. The harvest is the close and consummation of the age
 and the reapers are angels.","Just as the darnel (weeds resembling wheat) is gathered and burned with fire
 so it will be at the close of the age.","The Son of Man will send forth His angels
 and they will gather out of His kingdom all causes of offense [persons by whom others are drawn into error or sin] and all who do iniquity and act wickedly
","And will cast them into the furnace of fire; there will be weeping and wailing and grinding of teeth.","Then will the righteous (those who are upright and in right standing with God) shine forth like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Let him who has ears [to hear] be listening
 and let him consider and perceive and understand by hearing.","The kingdom of heaven is like something precious buried in a field
 which a man found and hid again; then in his joy he goes and sells all he has and buys that field.","Again the kingdom of heaven is like a man who is a dealer in search of fine and precious pearls
","Who
 on finding a single pearl of great price
 went and sold all he had and bought it.","Again
 the kingdom of heaven is like a dragnet which was cast into the sea and gathered in fish of every sort.","When it was full
 men dragged it up on the beach
 and sat down and sorted out the good fish into baskets
 but the worthless ones they threw away.","So it will be at the close and consummation of the age. The angels will go forth and separate the wicked from the righteous (those who are upright and in right standing with God)","And cast them [the wicked] into the furnace of fire; there will be weeping and wailing and grinding of teeth.","Have you understood all these things [parables] taken together? They said to Him
 Yes
 Lord.","He said to them
 Therefore every teacher and interpreter of the Sacred Writings who has been instructed about and trained for the kingdom of heaven and has become a disciple is like a householder who brings forth out of his storehouse treasure that is new and [treasure that is] old [the fresh as well as the familiar].","And they took offense at Him [they were repelled and hindered from acknowledging His authority
 and caused to stumble]. But Jesus said to them
 A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own house.","Jesus said
 They do not need to go away; you give them something to eat.","He said
 Bring them here to Me.","But instantly He spoke to them
 saying
 Take courage! I Am! Stop being afraid!","He said
 Come! So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water
 and he came toward Jesus.","Instantly Jesus reached out His hand and caught and held him
 saying to him
 O you of little faith
 why did you doubt?","He replied to them
 And why also do you transgress and violate the commandment of God for the sake of the rules handed down to you by your forefathers (the elders)?","For God commanded
 Honor your father and your mother
 and
 He who curses or reviles or speaks evil of or abuses or treats improperly his father or mother
 let him surely come to his end by death.","But you say
 If anyone tells his father or mother
 What you would have gained from me [that is
 the money and whatever I have that might be used for helping you] is already dedicated as a gift to God
 then he is exempt and no longer under obligation to honor and help his father or his mother.","So for the sake of your tradition (the rules handed down by your forefathers)
 you have set aside the Word of God [depriving it of force and authority and making it of no effect].","You pretenders (hypocrites)! Admirably and truly did Isaiah prophesy of you when he said:","These people draw near Me with their mouths and honor Me with their lips
 but their hearts hold off and are far away from Me.","Uselessly do they worship Me
 for they teach as doctrines the commands of men.","And Jesus called the people to Him and said to them
 Listen and grasp and comprehend this:","It is not what goes into the mouth of a man that makes him unclean and defiled
 but what comes out of the mouth; this makes a man unclean and defiles [him].","He answered
 Every plant which My heavenly Father has not planted will be torn up by the roots.","Let them alone and disregard them; they are blind guides and teachers. And if a blind man leads a blind man
 both will fall into a ditch.","And He said
 Are you also even yet dull and ignorant [without understanding and unable to put things together]?","Do you not see and understand that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the abdomen and so passes on into the place where discharges are deposited?","But whatever comes out of the mouth comes from the heart
 and this is what makes a man unclean and defiles [him].","For out of the heart come evil thoughts (reasonings and disputings and designs) such as murder
 adultery
 sexual vice
 theft
 false witnessing
 slander
 and irreverent speech.","These are what make a man unclean and defile [him]; but eating with unwashed hands does not make him unclean or defile [him].","He answered
 I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.","And He answered
 It is not right (proper
 becoming
 or fair) to take the children\u2019s bread and throw it to the little dogs.","Then Jesus answered her
 O woman
 great is your faith! Be it done for you as you wish. And her daughter was cured from that moment.","Then Jesus called His disciples to Him and said
 I have pity and sympathy and am deeply moved for the crowd
 because they have been with Me now three days and they have nothing [at all left] to eat; and I am not willing to send them away hungry
 lest they faint or become exhausted on the way.","And Jesus asked them
 How many loaves of bread do you have? They replied
 Seven
 and a few small fish.","He replied to them
 When it is evening you say
 It will be fair weather
 for the sky is red
","And in the morning
 It will be stormy today
 for the sky is red and has a gloomy and threatening look. You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky
 but you cannot interpret the signs of the times.","A wicked and morally unfaithful generation craves a sign
 but no sign shall be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. Then He left them and went away.","Jesus said to them
 Be careful and on your guard against the leaven (ferment) of the Pharisees and Sadducees.","But Jesus
 aware of this
 asked
 Why are you discussing among yourselves the fact that you have no bread? O you [men
 how little trust you have in Me
 how] little faith!","Do you not yet discern (perceive and understand)? Do you not remember the five loaves of the five thousand
 and how many [small hand] baskets you gathered?","Nor the seven loaves for the four thousand
 and how many [large provision] baskets you took up?","How is it that you fail to understand that I was not talking to you about bread? But beware of the leaven (ferment) of the Pharisees and Sadducees.","Now when Jesus went into the region of Caesarea Philippi
 He asked His disciples
 Who do people say that the Son of Man is?","He said to them
 But who do you [yourselves] say that I am?","Then Jesus answered him
 Blessed (happy
 fortunate
 and to be envied) are you
 Simon Bar-Jonah. For flesh and blood [men] have not revealed this to you
 but My Father Who is in heaven.","And I tell you
 you are Peter [Greek
 Petros\u2014a large piece of rock]
 and on this rock [Greek
 petra\u2014a huge rock like Gibraltar] I will build My church
 and the gates of Hades (the powers of the infernal region) shall not overpower it [or be strong to its detriment or hold out against it].","I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatever you bind (declare to be improper and unlawful) on earth must be what is already bound in heaven; and whatever you loose (declare lawful) on earth must be what is already loosed in heaven.","But Jesus turned away from Peter and said to him
 Get behind Me
 Satan! You are in My way [an offense and a hindrance and a snare to Me]; for you are minding what partakes not of the nature and quality of God
 but of men.","Then Jesus said to His disciples
 If anyone desires to be My disciple
 let him deny himself [disregard
 lose sight of
 and forget himself and his own interests] and take up his cross and follow Me [cleave steadfastly to Me
 conform wholly to My example in living and
 if need be
 in dying
 also].","For whoever is bent on saving his [temporal] life [his comfort and security here] shall lose it [eternal life]; and whoever loses his life [his comfort and security here] for My sake shall find it [life everlasting].","For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his life [his blessed life in the kingdom of God]? Or what would a man give as an exchange for his [blessed] life [in the kingdom of God]?","For the Son of Man is going to come in the glory (majesty
 splendor) of His Father with His angels
 and then He will render account and reward every man in accordance with what he has done.","Truly I tell you
 there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in (into) His kingdom.","But Jesus came and touched them and said
 Get up
 and do not be afraid.","And as they were going down the mountain
 Jesus cautioned and commanded them
 Do not mention to anyone what you have seen
 until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead.","He replied
 Elijah does come and will get everything restored and ready.","But I tell you that Elijah has come already
 and they did not know or recognize him
 but did to him as they liked. So also the Son of Man is going to be treated and suffer at their hands.","And Jesus answered
 O you unbelieving (warped
 wayward
 rebellious) and thoroughly perverse generation! How long am I to remain with you? How long am I to bear with you? Bring him here to Me.","He said to them
 Because of the littleness of your faith [that is
 your lack of firmly relying trust]. For truly I say to you
 if you have faith [that is living] like a grain of mustard seed
 you can say to this mountain
 Move from here to yonder place
 and it will move; and nothing will be impossible to you.","When they were going about here and there in Galilee
 Jesus said to them
 The Son of Man is going to be turned over into the hands of men.","And they will kill Him
 and He will be raised [to life] again on the third day. And they were deeply and exceedingly grieved and distressed.","He answered
 Yes. And when he came home
 Jesus spoke to him [about it] first
 saying
 What do you think
 Simon? From whom do earthly rulers collect duties or tribute\u2014from their own sons or from others not of their own family?","And when Peter said
 From other people not of their own family
 Jesus said to him
 Then the sons are exempt.","However
 in order not to give offense and cause them to stumble [that is
 to cause them to judge unfavorably and unjustly] go down to the sea and throw in a hook. Take the first fish that comes up
 and when you open its mouth you will find there a shekel. Take it and give it to them to pay the temple tax for Me and for yourself.","And said
 Truly I say to you
 unless you repent (change
 turn about) and become like little children [trusting
 lowly
 loving
 forgiving]
 you can never enter the kingdom of heaven [at all].","Whoever will humble himself therefore and become like this little child [trusting
 lowly
 loving
 forgiving] is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.","And whoever receives and accepts and welcomes one little child like this for My sake and in My name receives and accepts and welcomes Me.","But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in and acknowledge and cleave to Me to stumble and sin [that is
 who entices him or hinders him in right conduct or thought]
 it would be better (more expedient and profitable or advantageous) for him to have a great millstone fastened around his neck and to be sunk in the depth of the sea.","Woe to the world for such temptations to sin and influences to do wrong! It is necessary that temptations come
 but woe to the person on whose account or by whom the temptation comes!","And if your hand or your foot causes you to stumble and sin
 cut it off and throw it away from you; it is better (more profitable and wholesome) for you to enter life maimed or lame than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into everlasting fire.","And if your eye causes you to stumble and sin
 pluck it out and throw it away from you; it is better (more profitable and wholesome) for you to enter life with only one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the hell (Gehenna) of fire.","Beware that you do not despise or feel scornful toward or think little of one of these little ones
 for I tell you that in heaven their angels always are in the presence of and look upon the face of My Father Who is in heaven.","What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep
 and one of them has gone astray and gets lost
 will he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountain and go in search of the one that is lost?","And if it should be that he finds it
 truly I say to you
 he rejoices more over it than over the ninety-nine that did not get lost.","Just so it is not the will of My Father Who is in heaven that one of these little ones should be lost and perish.","If your brother wrongs you
 go and show him his fault
 between you and him privately. If he listens to you
 you have won back your brother.","But if he does not listen
 take along with you one or two others
 so that every word may be confirmed and upheld by the testimony of two or three witnesses.","If he pays no attention to them [refusing to listen and obey]
 tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church
 let him be to you as a pagan and a tax collector.","Truly I tell you
 whatever you forbid and declare to be improper and unlawful on earth must be what is already forbidden in heaven
 and whatever you permit and declare proper and lawful on earth must be what is already permitted in heaven.","Again I tell you
 if two of you on earth agree (harmonize together
 make a symphony together) about whatever [anything and everything] they may ask
 it will come to pass and be done for them by My Father in heaven.","For wherever two or three are gathered (drawn together as My followers) in (into) My name
 there I Am in the midst of them.","Jesus answered him
 I tell you
 not up to seven times
 but seventy times seven!","Therefore the kingdom of heaven is like a human king who wished to settle accounts with his attendants.","When he began the accounting
 one was brought to him who owed him 10
000 talents [probably about $10
000
000]
","And because he could not pay
 his master ordered him to be sold
 with his wife and his children and everything that he possessed
 and payment to be made.","So the attendant fell on his knees
 begging him
 Have patience with me and I will pay you everything.","And his master\u2019s heart was moved with compassion
 and he released him and forgave him [cancelling] the debt.","But that same attendant
 as he went out
 found one of his fellow attendants who owed him a hundred denarii [about twenty dollars]; and he caught him by the throat and said
 Pay what you owe!","So his fellow attendant fell down and begged him earnestly
 Give me time
 and I will pay you all!","But he was unwilling
 and he went out and had him put in prison till he should pay the debt.","When his fellow attendants saw what had happened
 they were greatly distressed
 and they went and told everything that had taken place to their master.","Then his master called him and said to him
 You contemptible and wicked attendant! I forgave and cancelled all that [great] debt of yours because you begged me to.","And should you not have had pity and mercy on your fellow attendant
 as I had pity and mercy on you?","And in wrath his master turned him over to the torturers (the jailers)
 till he should pay all that he owed.","So also My heavenly Father will deal with every one of you if you do not freely forgive your brother from your heart his offenses.","He replied
 Have you never read that He Who made them from the beginning made them male and female
","And said
 For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be united firmly (joined inseparably) to his wife
 and the two shall become one flesh?","So they are no longer two
 but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together
 let not man put asunder (separate).","He said to them
 Because of the hardness (stubbornness and perversity) of your hearts Moses permitted you to dismiss and repudiate and divorce your wives; but from the beginning it has not been so [ordained].","I say to you: whoever dismisses (repudiates
 divorces) his wife
 except for unchastity
 and marries another commits adultery
 and he who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.","But He said to them
 Not all men can accept this saying
 but it is for those to whom [the capacity to receive] it has been given.","For there are eunuchs who have been born incapable of marriage; and there are eunuchs who have been made so by men; and there are eunuchs who have made themselves incapable of marriage for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let him who is able to accept this accept it.","But He said
 Leave the children alone! Allow the little ones to come to Me
 and do not forbid or restrain or hinder them
 for of such [as these] is the kingdom of heaven composed.","And He said to him
 Why do you ask Me about the perfectly and essentially good? There is only One Who is good [perfectly and essentially]\u2014God. If you would enter into the Life
 you must continually keep the commandments.","He said to Him
 What sort of commandments? [Or
 which ones?] And Jesus answered
 You shall not kill
 You shall not commit adultery
 You shall not steal
 You shall not bear false witness
","Honor your father and your mother
 and
 You shall love your neighbor as [you do] yourself.","Jesus answered him
 If you would be perfect [that is
 have that spiritual maturity which accompanies self-sacrificing character]
 go and sell what you have and give to the poor
 and you will have riches in heaven; and come
 be My disciple [side with My party and follow Me].","And Jesus said to His disciples
 Truly I say to you
 it will be difficult for a rich man to get into the kingdom of heaven.","Again I tell you
 it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to go into the kingdom of heaven.","But Jesus looked at them and said
 With men this is impossible
 but all things are possible with God.","Jesus said to them
 Truly I say to you
 in the new age [the Messianic rebirth of the world]
 when the Son of Man shall sit down on the throne of His glory
 you who have [become My disciples
 sided with My party and] followed Me will also sit on twelve thrones and judge the twelve tribes of Israel.","And anyone and everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands for My name\u2019s sake will receive many [even a hundred] times more and will inherit eternal life.","But many who [now] are first will be last [then]
 and many who [now] are last will be first [then].","For the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of an estate who went out in the morning along with the dawn to hire workmen for his vineyard.","After agreeing with the laborers for a denarius a day
 he sent them into his vineyard.","And going out about the third hour (nine o\u2019clock)
 he saw others standing idle in the marketplace;","And he said to them
 You go also into the vineyard
 and whatever is right I will pay you. And they went.","He went out again about the sixth hour (noon)
 and the ninth hour (three o\u2019clock) he did the same.","And about the eleventh hour (five o\u2019clock) he went out and found still others standing around
 and said to them
 Why do you stand here idle all day?","They answered him
 Because nobody has hired us. He told them
 You go out into the vineyard also and you will get whatever is just and fair.","When evening came
 the owner of the vineyard said to his manager
 Call the workmen and pay them their wages
 beginning with the last and ending with the first.","And those who had been hired at the eleventh hour (five o\u2019clock) came and received a denarius each.","Now when the first came
 they supposed they would get more
 but each of them also received a denarius.","And when they received it
 they grumbled at the owner of the estate
","Saying
 These [men] who came last worked no more than an hour
 and yet you have made them rank with us who have borne the burden and the scorching heat of the day.","But he answered one of them
 Friend
 I am doing you no injustice. Did you not agree with me for a denarius?","Take what belongs to you and go. I choose to give to this man hired last the same as I give to you.","Am I not permitted to do what I choose with what is mine? [Or do you begrudge my being generous?] Is your eye evil because I am good?","So those who [now] are last will be first [then]
 and those who [now] are first will be last [then]. For many are called
 but few chosen.","Behold
 we are going up to Jerusalem
 and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and scribes; and they will sentence Him to death","And deliver Him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and whipped and crucified
 and He will be raised [to life] on the third day.","And He asked her
 What do you wish? She answered Him
 Give orders that these two sons of mine may sit
 one at Your right hand and one at Your left in Your kingdom.","But Jesus replied
 You do not realize what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink and to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized? They answered
 We are able.","And Jesus called them to Him and said
 You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them
 and their great men hold them in subjection [tyrannizing over them].","Not so shall it be among you; but whoever wishes to be great among you must be your servant
","And whoever desires to be first among you must be your slave\u2014","Just as the Son of Man came not to be waited on but to serve
 and to give His life as a ransom for many [the price paid to set them free].","And Jesus stopped and called them
 and asked
 What do you want Me to do for you?","Saying to them
 Go into the village that is opposite you
 and at once you will find a donkey tied
 and a colt with her; untie [them] and bring [them] to Me.","If anyone says anything to you
 you shall reply
 The Lord needs them
 and he will let them go without delay.","He said to them
 The Scripture says
 My house shall be called a house of prayer; but you have made it a den of robbers.","And they said to Him
 Do You hear what these are saying? And Jesus replied to them
 Yes; have you never read
 Out of the mouths of babes and unweaned infants You have made (provided) perfect praise?","And as He saw one single leafy fig tree above the roadside
 He went to it but He found nothing but leaves on it [seeing that in the fig tree the fruit appears at the same time as the leaves]. And He said to it
 Never again shall fruit grow on you! And the fig tree withered up at once.","And Jesus answered them
 Truly I say to you
 if you have faith (a firm relying trust) and do not doubt
 you will not only do what has been done to the fig tree
 but even if you say to this mountain
 Be taken up and cast into the sea
 it will be done.","And whatever you ask for in prayer
 having faith and [really] believing
 you will receive.","Jesus answered them
 I also will ask you a question
 and if you give Me the answer
 then I also will tell you by what power of authority I do these things.","The baptism of John\u2014from where was it? From heaven or from men? And they reasoned and argued with one another
 If we say
 From heaven
 He will ask us
 Why then did you not believe him?","So they answered Jesus
 We do not know. And He said to them
 Neither will I tell you by what power of authority I do these things.","What do you think? There was a man who had two sons. He came to the first and said
 Son
 go and work today in the vineyard.","And he answered
 I will not; but afterward he changed his mind and went.","Then the man came to the second and said the same [thing]. And he replied
 I will [go]
 sir; but he did not go.","Which of the two did the will of the father? They replied
 The first one. Jesus said to them
 Truly I tell you
 the tax collectors and the harlots will get into the kingdom of heaven before you.","For John came to you walking in the way of an upright man in right standing with God
 and you did not believe him
 but the tax collectors and the harlots did believe him; and you
 even when you saw that
 did not afterward change your minds and believe him [adhere to
 trust in
 and rely on what he told you].","Listen to another parable: There was a master of a house who planted a vineyard and put a hedge around it and dug a wine vat in it and built a watchtower. Then he let it out [for rent] to tenants and went into another country.","When the fruit season drew near
 he sent his servants to the tenants to get his [share of the] fruit.","But the tenants took his servants and beat one
 killed another
 and stoned another.","Again he sent other servants
 more than the first time
 and they treated them the same way.","Finally he sent his own son to them
 saying
 They will respect and give heed to my son.","But when the tenants saw the son
 they said to themselves
 This is the heir; come on
 let us kill him and have his inheritance.","And they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.","Now when the owner of the vineyard comes back
 what will he do to those tenants?","They said to Him
 He will put those wretches to a miserable death and rent the vineyard to other tenants of such a character that they will give him the fruits promptly in their season.","Jesus asked them
 Have you never read in the Scriptures: The very Stone which the builders rejected and threw away has become the Cornerstone; this is the Lord\u2019s doing
 and it is marvelous in our eyes?","I tell you
 for this reason the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce the fruits of it.","And whoever falls on this Stone will be broken to pieces
 but he on whom It falls will be crushed to powder [and It will winnow him
 scattering him like dust].","The kingdom of heaven is like a king who gave a wedding banquet for his son","And sent his servants to summon those who had been invited to the wedding banquet
 but they refused to come.","Again he sent other servants
 saying
 Tell those who are invited
 Behold
 I have prepared my banquet; my bullocks and my fat calves are killed
 and everything is prepared; come to the wedding feast.","But they were not concerned and paid no attention [they ignored and made light of the summons
 treating it with contempt] and they went away\u2014one to his farm
 another to his business
","While the others seized his servants
 treated them shamefully
 and put them to death.","[Hearing this] the king was infuriated; and he sent his soldiers and put those murderers to death and burned their city.","Then he said to his servants
 The wedding [feast] is prepared
 but those invited were not worthy.","So go to the thoroughfares where they leave the city [where the main roads and those from the country end] and invite to the wedding feast as many as you find.","And those servants went out on the crossroads and got together as many as they found
 both bad and good
 so [the room in which] the wedding feast [was held] was filled with guests.","But when the king came in to view the guests
 he looked intently at a man there who had on no wedding garment.","And he said
 Friend
 how did you come in here without putting on the [appropriate] wedding garment? And he was speechless (muzzled
 gagged).","Then the king said to the attendants
 Tie him hand and foot
 and throw him into the darkness outside; there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.","For many are called (invited and summoned)
 but few are chosen.","But Jesus
 aware of their malicious plot
 asked
 Why do you put Me to the test and try to entrap Me
 you pretenders (hypocrites)?","Show me the money used for the tribute. And they brought Him a denarius.","And Jesus said to them
 Whose likeness and title are these?","They said
 Caesar\u2019s. Then He said to them
 Pay therefore to Caesar the things that are due to Caesar
 and pay to God the things that are due to God.","But Jesus replied to them
 You are wrong because you know neither the Scriptures nor God\u2019s power.","For in the resurrected state neither do [men] marry nor are [women] given in marriage
 but they are like the angels in heaven.","But as to the resurrection of the dead\u2014have you never read what was said to you by God
","I am the God of Abraham
 and the God of Isaac
 and the God of Jacob? He is not the God of the dead but of the living!","And He replied to him
 You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind (intellect).","This is the great (most important
 principal) and first commandment.","And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as [you do] yourself.","These two commandments sum up and upon them depend all the Law and the Prophets.","Saying
 What do you think of the Christ? Whose Son is He? They said to Him
 The Son of David.","He said to them
 How is it then that David
 under the influence of the [Holy] Spirit
 calls Him Lord
 saying
","The Lord said to My Lord
 Sit at My right hand until I put Your enemies under Your feet?","If then David thus calls Him Lord
 how is He his Son?","The scribes and Pharisees sit on Moses\u2019 seat [of authority].","So observe and practice all they tell you; but do not do what they do
 for they preach
 but do not practice.","They tie up heavy loads
 hard to bear
 and place them on men\u2019s shoulders
 but they themselves will not lift a finger to help bear them.","They do all their works to be seen of men; for they make wide their phylacteries (small cases enclosing certain Scripture passages
 worn during prayer on the left arm and forehead) and make long their fringes [worn by all male Israelites
 according to the command].","And they take pleasure in and [thus] love the place of honor at feasts and the best seats in the synagogues
","And to be greeted with honor in the marketplaces and to have people call them rabbi.","But you are not to be called rabbi (teacher)
 for you have one Teacher and you are all brothers.","And do not call anyone [in the church] on earth father
 for you have one Father
 Who is in heaven.","And you must not be called masters (leaders)
 for you have one Master (Leader)
 the Christ.","He who is greatest among you shall be your servant.","Whoever exalts himself [with haughtiness and empty pride] shall be humbled (brought low)
 and whoever humbles himself [whoever has a modest opinion of himself and behaves accordingly] shall be raised to honor.","But woe to you
 scribes and Pharisees
 pretenders (hypocrites)! For you shut the kingdom of heaven in men\u2019s faces; for you neither enter yourselves
 nor do you allow those who are about to go in to do so.","Woe to you
 scribes and Pharisees
 pretenders (hypocrites)! For you travel over sea and land to make a single proselyte
 and when he becomes one [a proselyte]
 you make him doubly as much a child of hell (Gehenna) as you are.","Woe to you
 blind guides
 who say
 If anyone swears by the sanctuary of the temple
 it is nothing; but if anyone swears by the gold of the sanctuary
 he is a debtor [bound by his oath].","You blind fools! For which is greater: the gold
 or the sanctuary of the temple that has made the gold sacred?","You say too
 Whoever swears by the altar is not duty bound; but whoever swears by the offering on the altar
 his oath is binding.","You blind men! Which is greater: the gift
 or the altar which makes the gift sacred?","So whoever swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it.","And he who swears by the sanctuary of the temple swears by it and by Him Who dwells in it.","And whoever swears by heaven swears by the throne of God and by Him Who sits upon it.","Woe to you
 scribes and Pharisees
 pretenders (hypocrites)! For you give a tenth of your mint and dill and cummin
 and have neglected and omitted the weightier (more important) matters of the Law\u2014right and justice and mercy and fidelity. These you ought [particularly] to have done
 without neglecting the others.","You blind guides
 filtering out a gnat and gulping down a camel!","Woe to you
 scribes and Pharisees
 pretenders (hypocrites)! For you clean the outside of the cup and of the plate
 but within they are full of extortion (prey
 spoil
 plunder) and grasping self-indulgence.","You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and of the plate
 so that the outside may be clean also.","Woe to you
 scribes and Pharisees
 pretenders (hypocrites)! For you are like tombs that have been whitewashed
 which look beautiful on the outside but inside are full of dead men\u2019s bones and everything impure.","Just so
 you also outwardly seem to people to be just and upright but inside you are full of pretense and lawlessness and iniquity.","Woe to you
 scribes and Pharisees
 pretenders (hypocrites)! For you build tombs for the prophets and decorate the monuments of the righteous
","Saying
 If we had lived in the days of our forefathers
 we would not have aided them in shedding the blood of the prophets.","Thus you are testifying against yourselves that you are the descendants of those who murdered the prophets.","Fill up
 then
 the measure of your fathers\u2019 sins to the brim [so that nothing may be wanting to a full measure].","You serpents! You spawn of vipers! How can you escape the penalty to be suffered in hell (Gehenna)?","Because of this
 take notice: I am sending you prophets and wise men (interpreters and teachers) and scribes (men learned in the Mosaic Law and the Prophets); some of them you will kill
 even crucify
 and some you will flog in your synagogues and pursue and persecute from town to town
","So that upon your heads may come all the blood of the righteous (those who correspond to the divine standard of right) shed on earth
 from the blood of the righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Barachiah
 whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar [of burnt offering].","Truly I declare to you
 all these [evil
 calamitous times] will come upon this generation.","O Jerusalem
 Jerusalem
 murdering the prophets and stoning those who are sent to you! How often would I have gathered your children together as a mother fowl gathers her brood under her wings
 and you refused!","Behold
 your house is forsaken and desolate (abandoned and left destitute of God\u2019s help).","For I declare to you
 you will not see Me again until you say
 Blessed (magnified in worship
 adored
 and exalted) is He Who comes in the name of the Lord!","But He answered them
 Do you see all these? Truly I tell you
 there will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down.","Jesus answered them
 Be careful that no one misleads you [deceiving you and leading you into error].","For many will come in (on the strength of) My name [appropriating the name which belongs to Me]
 saying
 I am the Christ (the Messiah)
 and they will lead many astray.","And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars; see that you are not frightened or troubled
 for this must take place
 but the end is not yet.","For nation will rise against nation
 and kingdom against kingdom
 and there will be famines and earthquakes in place after place;","All this is but the beginning [the early pains] of the birth pangs [of the intolerable anguish].","Then they will hand you over to suffer affliction and tribulation and put you to death
 and you will be hated by all nations for My name\u2019s sake.","And then many will be offended and repelled and will begin to distrust and desert [Him Whom they ought to trust and obey] and will stumble and fall away and betray one another and pursue one another with hatred.","And many false prophets will rise up and deceive and lead many into error.","And the love of the great body of people will grow cold because of the multiplied lawlessness and iniquity
","But he who endures to the end will be saved.","And this good news of the kingdom (the Gospel) will be preached throughout the whole world as a testimony to all the nations
 and then will come the end.","So when you see the appalling sacrilege [the abomination that astonishes and makes desolate]
 spoken of by the prophet Daniel
 standing in the Holy Place\u2014let the reader take notice and ponder and consider and heed [this]\u2014","Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains;","Let him who is on the housetop not come down and go into the house to take anything;","And let him who is in the field not turn back to get his overcoat.","And alas for the women who are pregnant and for those who have nursing babies in those days!","Pray that your flight may not be in winter or on a Sabbath.","For then there will be great tribulation (affliction
 distress
 and oppression) such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now\u2014no
 and never will be [again].","And if those days had not been shortened
 no human being would endure and survive
 but for the sake of the elect (God\u2019s chosen ones) those days will be shortened.","If anyone says to you then
 Behold
 here is the Christ (the Messiah)! or
 There He is!\u2014do not believe it.","For false Christs and false prophets will arise
 and they will show great signs and wonders so as to deceive and lead astray
 if possible
 even the elect (God\u2019s chosen ones).","See
 I have warned you beforehand.","So if they say to you
 Behold
 He is in the wilderness (desert)\u2014do not go out there; if they tell you
 Behold
 He is in the secret places or inner rooms\u2014do not believe it.","For just as the lightning flashes from the east and shines and is seen as far as the west
 so will the coming of the Son of Man be.","Wherever there is a fallen body (a corpse)
 there the vultures (or eagles) will flock together.","Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened
 and the moon will not shed its light
 and the stars will fall from the sky
 and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.","Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky
 and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn and beat their breasts and lament in anguish
 and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory [in brilliancy and splendor].","And He will send out His angels with a loud trumpet call
 and they will gather His elect (His chosen ones) from the four winds
 [even] from one end of the universe to the other.","From the fig tree learn this lesson: as soon as its young shoots become soft and tender and it puts out its leaves
 you know of a surety that summer is near.","So also when you see these signs
 all taken together
 coming to pass
 you may know of a surety that He is near
 at the very doors.","Truly I tell you
 this generation (the whole multitude of people living at the same time
 in a definite
 given period) will not pass away till all these things taken together take place.","Sky and earth will pass away
 but My words will not pass away.","But of that [exact] day and hour no one knows
 not even the angels of heaven
 nor the Son
 but only the Father.","As were the days of Noah
 so will be the coming of the Son of Man.","For just as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking
 [men] marrying and [women] being given in marriage
 until the [very] day when Noah went into the ark
","And they did not know or understand until the flood came and swept them all away\u2014so will be the coming of the Son of Man.","At that time two men will be in the field; one will be taken and one will be left.","Two women will be grinding at the hand mill; one will be taken and one will be left.","Watch therefore [give strict attention
 be cautious and active]
 for you do not know in what kind of a day [whether a near or remote one] your Lord is coming.","But understand this: had the householder known in what [part of the night
 whether in a night or a morning] watch the thief was coming
 he would have watched and would not have allowed his house to be undermined and broken into.","You also must be ready therefore
 for the Son of Man is coming at an hour when you do not expect Him.","Who then is the faithful
 thoughtful
 and wise servant
 whom his master has put in charge of his household to give to the others the food and supplies at the proper time?","Blessed (happy
 fortunate
 and to be envied) is that servant whom
 when his master comes
 he will find so doing.","I solemnly declare to you
 he will set him over all his possessions.","But if that servant is wicked and says to himself
 My master is delayed and is going to be gone a long time
","And begins to beat his fellow servants and to eat and drink with the drunken
","The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour of which he is not aware
","And will punish him [cut him up by scourging] and put him with the pretenders (hypocrites); there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.","Then the kingdom of heaven shall be likened to ten virgins who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom.","Five of them were foolish (thoughtless
 without forethought) and five were wise (sensible
 intelligent
 and prudent).","For when the foolish took their lamps
 they did not take any [extra] oil with them;","But the wise took flasks of oil along with them [also] with their lamps.","While the bridegroom lingered and was slow in coming
 they all began nodding their heads
 and they fell asleep.","But at midnight there was a shout
 Behold
 the bridegroom! Go out to meet him!","Then all those virgins got up and put their own lamps in order.","And the foolish said to the wise
 Give us some of your oil
 for our lamps are going out.","But the wise replied
 There will not be enough for us and for you; go instead to the dealers and buy for yourselves.","But while they were going away to buy
 the bridegroom came
 and those who were prepared went in with him to the marriage feast; and the door was shut.","Later the other virgins also came and said
 Lord
 Lord
 open [the door] to us!","But He replied
 I solemnly declare to you
 I do not know you [I am not acquainted with you].","Watch therefore [give strict attention and be cautious and active]
 for you know neither the day nor the hour when the Son of Man will come.","For it is like a man who was about to take a long journey
 and he called his servants together and entrusted them with his property.","To one he gave five talents [probably about $5
000]
 to another two
 to another one\u2014to each in proportion to his own personal ability. Then he departed and left the country.","He who had received the five talents went at once and traded with them
 and he gained five talents more.","And likewise he who had received the two talents\u2014he also gained two talents more.","But he who had received the one talent went and dug a hole in the ground and hid his master\u2019s money.","Now after a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them.","And he who had received the five talents came and brought him five more
 saying
 Master
 you entrusted to me five talents; see
 here I have gained five talents more.","His master said to him
 Well done
 you upright (honorable
 admirable) and faithful servant! You have been faithful and trustworthy over a little; I will put you in charge of much. Enter into and share the joy (the delight
 the blessedness) which your master enjoys.","And he also who had the two talents came forward
 saying
 Master
 you entrusted two talents to me; here I have gained two talents more.","His master said to him
 Well done
 you upright (honorable
 admirable) and faithful servant! You have been faithful and trustworthy over a little; I will put you in charge of much. Enter into and share the joy (the delight
 the blessedness) which your master enjoys.","He who had received one talent also came forward
 saying
 Master
 I knew you to be a harsh and hard man
 reaping where you did not sow
 and gathering where you had not winnowed [the grain].","So I was afraid
 and I went and hid your talent in the ground. Here you have what is your own.","But his master answered him
 You wicked and lazy and idle servant! Did you indeed know that I reap where I have not sowed and gather [grain] where I have not winnowed?","Then you should have invested my money with the bankers
 and at my coming I would have received what was my own with interest.","So take the talent away from him and give it to the one who has the ten talents.","For to everyone who has will more be given
 and he will be furnished richly so that he will have an abundance; but from the one who does not have
 even what he does have will be taken away.","And throw the good-for-nothing servant into the outer darkness; there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.","When the Son of Man comes in His glory (His majesty and splendor)
 and all the holy angels with Him
 then He will sit on the throne of His glory.","All nations will be gathered before Him
 and He will separate them [the people] from one another as a shepherd separates his sheep from the goats;","And He will cause the sheep to stand at His right hand
 but the goats at His left.","Then the King will say to those at His right hand
 Come
 you blessed of My Father [you favored of God and appointed to eternal salvation]
 inherit (receive as your own) the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.","For I was hungry and you gave Me food
 I was thirsty and you gave Me something to drink
 I was a stranger and you brought Me together with yourselves and welcomed and entertained and lodged Me
","I was naked and you clothed Me
 I was sick and you visited Me with help and ministering care
 I was in prison and you came to see Me.","Then the just and upright will answer Him
 Lord
 when did we see You hungry and gave You food
 or thirsty and gave You something to drink?","And when did we see You a stranger and welcomed and entertained You
 or naked and clothed You?","And when did we see You sick or in prison and came to visit You?","And the King will reply to them
 Truly I tell you
 in so far as you did it for one of the least [in the estimation of men] of these My brethren
 you did it for Me.","Then He will say to those at His left hand
 Begone from Me
 you cursed
 into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels!","For I was hungry and you gave Me no food
 I was thirsty and you gave Me nothing to drink
","I was a stranger and you did not welcome Me and entertain Me
 I was naked and you did not clothe Me
 I was sick and in prison and you did not visit Me with help and ministering care.","Then they also [in their turn] will answer
 Lord
 when did we see You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison
 and did not minister to You?","And He will reply to them
 Solemnly I declare to you
 in so far as you failed to do it for the least [in the estimation of men] of these
 you failed to do it for Me.","Then they will go away into eternal punishment
 but those who are just and upright and in right standing with God into eternal life.","You know that the Passover is in two days\u2014and the Son of Man will be delivered up treacherously to be crucified.","But Jesus
 fully aware of this
 said to them
 Why do you bother the woman? She has done a noble (praiseworthy and beautiful) thing to Me.","For you always have the poor among you
 but you will not always have Me.","In pouring this perfume on My body she has done something to prepare Me for My burial.","Truly I tell you
 wherever this good news (the Gospel) is preached in the whole world
 what this woman has done will be told also
 in memory of her.","He said
 Go into the city to a certain man and say to him
 The Master says: My time is near; I will keep the Passover at your house with My disciples.","And as they were eating
 He said
 Solemnly I say to you
 one of you will betray Me!","He replied
 He who has [just] dipped his hand in the same dish with Me will betray Me!","The Son of Man is going just as it is written of Him; but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better (more profitable and wholesome) for that man if he had never been born!","Judas
 the betrayer
 said
 Surely it is not I
 is it
 Master? He said to him
 You have stated [the fact].","Now as they were eating
 Jesus took bread and
 praising God
 gave thanks and asked Him to bless it to their use
 and when He had broken it
 He gave it to the disciples and said
 Take
 eat; this is My body.","And He took a cup
 and when He had given thanks
 He gave it to them
 saying
 Drink of it
 all of you;","For this is My blood of the new covenant
 which [ratifies the agreement and] is being poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.","I say to you
 I shall not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it with you new and of superior quality in My Father\u2019s kingdom.","Then Jesus said to them
 You will all be offended and stumble and fall away because of Me this night [distrusting and deserting Me]
 for it is written
 I will strike the Shepherd
 and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.","But after I am raised up [to life again]
 I will go ahead of you to Galilee.","Jesus said to him
 Solemnly I declare to you
 this very night
 before a single rooster crows
 you will deny and disown Me three times.","Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane
 and He told His disciples
 Sit down here while I go over yonder and pray.","Then He said to them
 My soul is very sad and deeply grieved
 so that I am almost dying of sorrow. Stay here and keep awake and keep watch with Me.","And going a little farther
 He threw Himself upon the ground on His face and prayed saying
 My Father
 if it is possible
 let this cup pass away from Me; nevertheless
 not what I will [not what I desire]
 but as You will and desire.","And He came to the disciples and found them sleeping
 and He said to Peter
 What! Are you so utterly unable to stay awake and keep watch with Me for one hour?","All of you must keep awake (give strict attention
 be cautious and active) and watch and pray
 that you may not come into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing
 but the flesh is weak.","Again a second time He went away and prayed
 My Father
 if this cannot pass by unless I drink it
 Your will be done.","Then He returned to the disciples and said to them
 Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? Behold
 the hour is at hand
 and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of especially wicked sinners [whose way or nature it is to act in opposition to God].","Get up
 let us be going! See
 My betrayer is at hand!","Jesus said to him
 Friend
 for what are you here? Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus and arrested Him.","Then Jesus said to him
 Put your sword back into its place
 for all who draw the sword will die by the sword.","Do you suppose that I cannot appeal to My Father
 and He will immediately provide Me with more than twelve legions [more than 80
000] of angels?","But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled
 that it must come about this way?","At that moment Jesus said to the crowds
 Have you come out with swords and clubs as [you would] against a robber to capture Me? Day after day I was accustomed to sit in the porches and courts of the temple teaching
 and you did not arrest Me.","But all this has taken place in order that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples deserted Him and
 fleeing
 escaped.","Jesus said to him
 You have stated [the fact]. More than that
 I tell you: You will in the future see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Almighty and coming on the clouds of the sky.","And Peter remembered Jesus\u2019 words
 when He had said
 Before a single rooster crows
 you will deny and disown Me three times. And he went outside and wept bitterly.","Now Jesus stood before the governor [Pilate]
 and the governor asked Him
 Are you the King of the Jews? Jesus said to him
 You have stated [the fact].","And about the ninth hour (three o\u2019clock) Jesus cried with a loud voice
 Eli
 Eli
 lama sabachthani?\u2014that is
 My God
 My God
 why have You abandoned Me [leaving Me helpless
 forsaking and failing Me in My need]?","And as they went
 behold
 Jesus met them and said
 Hail (greetings)! And they went up to Him and clasped His feet and worshiped Him.","Then Jesus said to them
 Do not be alarmed and afraid; go and tell My brethren to go into Galilee
 and there they will see Me.","Jesus approached and
 breaking the silence
 said to them
 All authority (all power of rule) in heaven and on earth has been given to Me.","Go then and make disciples of all the nations
 baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit
","Teaching them to observe everything that I have commanded you
 and behold
 I am with you all the days (perpetually
 uniformly
 and on every occasion)
 to the [very] close and consummation of the age. Amen (so let it be).","Jesus answered
 \u201cAllow me to be baptized now. This is necessary to fulfill all righteousness.\u201d So John agreed to baptize Jesus.","Jesus replied
 \u201cIt\u2019s written
 People won\u2019t live only by bread
 but by every word spoken by God.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cAgain it\u2019s written
 Don\u2019t test the Lord your God.\u201d","Jesus responded
 \u201cGo away
 Satan
 because it\u2019s written
You will worship the Lord your God and serve only him.\u201d","From that time Jesus began to announce
 \u201cChange your hearts and lives! Here comes the kingdom of heaven!\u201d","\u201cCome
 follow me
\u201d he said
 \u201cand I\u2019ll show you how to fish for people.\u201d","\u201cHappy are people who are hopeless
 because the kingdom of heaven is theirs.","\u201cHappy are people who grieve
 because they will be made glad.","\u201cHappy are people who are humble
 because they will inherit the earth.","\u201cHappy are people who are hungry and thirsty for righteousness
 because they will be fed until they are full.","\u201cHappy are people who show mercy
 because they will receive mercy.","\u201cHappy are people who have pure hearts
 because they will see God.","\u201cHappy are people who make peace
 because they will be called God\u2019s children.","\u201cHappy are people whose lives are harassed because they are righteous
 because the kingdom of heaven is theirs.","\u201cHappy are you when people insult you and harass you and speak all kinds of bad and false things about you
 all because of me.","Be full of joy and be glad
 because you have a great reward in heaven. In the same way
 people harassed the prophets who came before you.","\u201cYou are the salt of the earth. But if salt loses its saltiness
 how will it become salty again? It\u2019s good for nothing except to be thrown away and trampled under people\u2019s feet.","You are the light of the world. A city on top of a hill can\u2019t be hidden.","Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a basket. Instead
 they put it on top of a lampstand
 and it shines on all who are in the house.","In the same way
 let your light shine before people
 so they can see the good things you do and praise your Father who is in heaven.","\u201cDon\u2019t even begin to think that I have come to do away with the Law and the Prophets. I haven\u2019t come to do away with them but to fulfill them.","I say to you very seriously that as long as heaven and earth exist
 neither the smallest letter nor even the smallest stroke of a pen will be erased from the Law until everything there becomes a reality.","Therefore
 whoever ignores one of the least of these commands and teaches others to do the same will be called the lowest in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever keeps these commands and teaches people to keep them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.","I say to you that unless your righteousness is greater than the righteousness of the legal experts and the Pharisees
 you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.","\u201cYou have heard that it was said to those who lived long ago
 Don\u2019t commit murder
 and all who commit murder will be in danger of judgment.","But I say to you that everyone who is angry with their brother or sister will be in danger of judgment. If they say to their brother or sister
 \u2018You idiot
\u2019 they will be in danger of being condemned by the governing council. And if they say
 \u2018You fool
\u2019 they will be in danger of fiery hell.","Therefore
 if you bring your gift to the altar and there remember that your brother or sister has something against you
","leave your gift at the altar and go. First make things right with your brother or sister and then come back and offer your gift.","Be sure to make friends quickly with your opponents while you are with them on the way to court. Otherwise
 they will haul you before the judge
 the judge will turn you over to the officer of the court
 and you will be thrown into prison.","I say to you in all seriousness that you won\u2019t get out of there until you\u2019ve paid the very last penny.","\u201cYou have heard that it was said
 Don\u2019t commit adultery.","But I say to you that every man who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery in his heart.","And if your right eye causes you to fall into sin
 tear it out and throw it away. It\u2019s better that you lose a part of your body than that your whole body be thrown into hell.","And if your right hand causes you to fall into sin
 chop it off and throw it away. It\u2019s better that you lose a part of your body than that your whole body go into hell.","\u201cIt was said
 \u2018Whoever divorces his wife must give her a divorce certificate.\u2019","But I say to you that whoever divorces his wife except for sexual unfaithfulness forces her to commit adultery. And whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.","\u201cAgain you have heard that it was said to those who lived long ago: Don\u2019t make a false solemn pledge
 but you should follow through on what you have pledged to the Lord.","But I say to you that you must not pledge at all. You must not pledge by heaven
 because it\u2019s God\u2019s throne.","You must not pledge by the earth
 because it\u2019s God\u2019s footstool. You must not pledge by Jerusalem
 because it\u2019s the city of the great king.","And you must not pledge by your head
 because you can\u2019t turn one hair white or black.","Let your yes mean yes
 and your no mean no. Anything more than this comes from the evil one.","\u201cYou have heard that it was said
 An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.","But I say to you that you must not oppose those who want to hurt you. If people slap you on your right cheek
 you must turn the left cheek to them as well.","When they wish to haul you to court and take your shirt
 let them have your coat too.","When they force you to go one mile
 go with them two.","Give to those who ask
 and don\u2019t refuse those who wish to borrow from you.","\u201cYou have heard that it was said
 You must love your neighbor and hate your enemy.","But I say to you
 love your enemies and pray for those who harass you","so that you will be acting as children of your Father who is in heaven. He makes the sun rise on both the evil and the good and sends rain on both the righteous and the unrighteous.","If you love only those who love you
 what reward do you have? Don\u2019t even the tax collectors do the same?","And if you greet only your brothers and sisters
 what more are you doing? Don\u2019t even the Gentiles do the same?","Therefore
 just as your heavenly Father is complete in showing love to everyone
 so also you must be complete.","\u201cBe careful that you don\u2019t practice your religion in front of people to draw their attention. If you do
 you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven.","\u201cWhenever you give to the poor
 don\u2019t blow your trumpet as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets so that they may get praise from people. I assure you
 that\u2019s the only reward they\u2019ll get.","But when you give to the poor
 don\u2019t let your left hand know what your right hand is doing","so that you may give to the poor in secret. Your Father who sees what you do in secret will reward you.","\u201cWhen you pray
 don\u2019t be like hypocrites. They love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners so that people will see them. I assure you
 that\u2019s the only reward they\u2019ll get.","But when you pray
 go to your room
 shut the door
 and pray to your Father who is present in that secret place. Your Father who sees what you do in secret will reward you.","\u201cWhen you pray
 don\u2019t pour out a flood of empty words
 as the Gentiles do. They think that by saying many words they\u2019ll be heard.","Don\u2019t be like them
 because your Father knows what you need before you ask.","Pray like this: Our Father who is in heaven
 uphold the holiness of your name.","Bring in your kingdom so that your will is done on earth as it\u2019s done in heaven.","Give us the bread we need for today.","Forgive us for the ways we have wronged you
 just as we also forgive those who have wronged us.","And don\u2019t lead us into temptation
 but rescue us from the evil one.","\u201cIf you forgive others their sins
 your heavenly Father will also forgive you.","But if you don\u2019t forgive others
 neither will your Father forgive your sins.","\u201cAnd when you fast
 don\u2019t put on a sad face like the hypocrites. They distort their faces so people will know they are fasting. I assure you that they have their reward.","When you fast
 brush your hair and wash your face.","Then you won\u2019t look like you are fasting to people
 but only to your Father who is present in that secret place. Your Father who sees in secret will reward you.","\u201cStop collecting treasures for your own benefit on earth
 where moth and rust eat them and where thieves break in and steal them.","Instead
 collect treasures for yourselves in heaven
 where moth and rust don\u2019t eat them and where thieves don\u2019t break in and steal them.","Where your treasure is
 there your heart will be also.","\u201cThe eye is the lamp of the body. Therefore
 if your eye is healthy
 your whole body will be full of light.","But if your eye is bad
 your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light in you is darkness
 how terrible that darkness will be!","No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other
 or you will be loyal to the one and have contempt for the other. You cannot serve God and wealth.","\u201cTherefore
 I say to you
 don\u2019t worry about your life
 what you\u2019ll eat or what you\u2019ll drink
 or about your body
 what you\u2019ll wear. Isn\u2019t life more than food and the body more than clothes?","Look at the birds in the sky. They don\u2019t sow seed or harvest grain or gather crops into barns. Yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Aren\u2019t you worth much more than they are?","Who among you by worrying can add a single moment to your life?","And why do you worry about clothes? Notice how the lilies in the field grow. They don\u2019t wear themselves out with work
 and they don\u2019t spin cloth.","But I say to you that even Solomon in all of his splendor wasn\u2019t dressed like one of these.","If God dresses grass in the field so beautifully
 even though it\u2019s alive today and tomorrow it\u2019s thrown into the furnace
 won\u2019t God do much more for you
 you people of weak faith?","Therefore
 don\u2019t worry and say
 \u2018What are we going to eat?\u2019 or \u2018What are we going to drink?\u2019 or \u2018What are we going to wear?\u2019","Gentiles long for all these things. Your heavenly Father knows that you need them.","Instead
 desire first and foremost God\u2019s kingdom and God\u2019s righteousness
 and all these things will be given to you as well.","Therefore
 stop worrying about tomorrow
 because tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.","\u201cDon\u2019t judge
 so that you won\u2019t be judged.","You\u2019ll receive the same judgment you give. Whatever you deal out will be dealt out to you.","Why do you see the splinter that\u2019s in your brother\u2019s or sister\u2019s eye
 but don\u2019t notice the log in your own eye?","How can you say to your brother or sister
 \u2018Let me take the splinter out of your eye
\u2019 when there\u2019s a log in your eye?","You deceive yourself! First take the log out of your eye
 and then you\u2019ll see clearly to take the splinter out of your brother\u2019s or sister\u2019s eye.","Don\u2019t give holy things to dogs
 and don\u2019t throw your pearls in front of pigs. They will stomp on the pearls
 then turn around and attack you.","\u201cAsk
 and you will receive. Search
 and you will find. Knock
 and the door will be opened to you.","For everyone who asks
 receives. Whoever seeks
 finds. And to everyone who knocks
 the door is opened.","Who among you will give your children a stone when they ask for bread?","Or give them a snake when they ask for fish?","If you who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children
 how much more will your heavenly Father give good things to those who ask him.","Therefore
 you should treat people in the same way that you want people to treat you; this is the Law and the Prophets.","\u201cGo in through the narrow gate. The gate that leads to destruction is broad and the road wide
 so many people enter through it.","But the gate that leads to life is narrow and the road difficult
 so few people find it.","\u201cWatch out for false prophets. They come to you dressed like sheep
 but inside they are vicious wolves.","You will know them by their fruit. Do people get bunches of grapes from thorny weeds
 or do they get figs from thistles?","In the same way
 every good tree produces good fruit
 and every rotten tree produces bad fruit.","A good tree can\u2019t produce bad fruit. And a rotten tree can\u2019t produce good fruit.","Every tree that doesn\u2019t produce good fruit is chopped down and thrown into the fire.","Therefore
 you will know them by their fruit.","\u201cNot everybody who says to me
 \u2018Lord
 Lord
\u2019 will get into the kingdom of heaven. Only those who do the will of my Father who is in heaven will enter.","On the Judgment Day
 many people will say to me
 \u2018Lord
 Lord
 didn\u2019t we prophesy in your name and expel demons in your name and do lots of miracles in your name?\u2019","Then I\u2019ll tell them
 \u2018I\u2019ve never known you. Get away from me
 you people who do wrong.\u2019","\u201cEverybody who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise builder who built a house on bedrock.","The rain fell
 the floods came
 and the wind blew and beat against that house. It didn\u2019t fall because it was firmly set on bedrock.","But everybody who hears these words of mine and doesn\u2019t put them into practice will be like a fool who built a house on sand.","The rain fell
 the floods came
 and the wind blew and beat against that house. It fell and was completely destroyed.\u201d","Jesus reached out his hand and touched him
 saying
 \u201cI do want to. Become clean.\u201d Instantly his skin disease was cleansed.","Jesus said to him
 \u201cDon\u2019t say anything to anyone. Instead
 go and show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded. This will be a testimony to them.\u201d","Jesus responded
 \u201cI\u2019ll come and heal him.\u201d","When Jesus heard this
 he was impressed and said to the people following him
 \u201cI say to you with all seriousness that even in Israel I haven\u2019t found faith like this.","I say to you that there are many who will come from east and west and sit down to eat with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.","But the children of the kingdom will be thrown outside into the darkness. People there will be weeping and grinding their teeth.\u201d","Jesus said to the centurion
 \u201cGo; it will be done for you just as you have believed.\u201d And his servant was healed that very moment.","Jesus replied
 \u201cFoxes have dens
 and the birds in the sky have nests
 but the Human One has no place to lay his head.\u201d","But Jesus said to him
 \u201cFollow me
 and let the dead bury their own dead.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cWhy are you afraid
 you people of weak faith?\u201d Then he got up and gave orders to the winds and the lake
 and there was a great calm.","Then he said to the demons
 \u201cGo away
\u201d and they came out and went into the pigs. The whole herd rushed down the cliff into the lake and drowned.","People brought to him a man who was paralyzed
 lying on a cot. When Jesus saw their faith
 he said to the man who was paralyzed
 \u201cBe encouraged
 my child
 your sins are forgiven.\u201d","But Jesus knew what they were thinking and said
 \u201cWhy do you fill your minds with evil things?","Which is easier\u2014to say
 \u2018Your sins are forgiven
\u2019 or to say
 \u2018Get up and walk\u2019?","But so you will know that the Human One has authority on the earth to forgive sins\u201d\u2014he said to the man who was paralyzed\u2014\u201cGet up
 take your cot
 and go home.\u201d","As Jesus continued on from there
 he saw a man named Matthew sitting at a kiosk for collecting taxes. He said to him
 \u201cFollow me
\u201d and he got up and followed him.","When Jesus heard it
 he said
 \u201cHealthy people don\u2019t need a doctor
 but sick people do.","Go and learn what this means: I want mercy and not sacrifice. I didn\u2019t come to call righteous people

 \u201cThe wedding guests can\u2019t mourn while the groom is still with them
 can they? But the days will come when the groom will be taken away from them

 unshrunk cloth on old clothes because the patch tears away the cloth and makes a worse tear.","No one pours new wine into old wineskins. If they did
 the wineskins would burst
 the wine would spill

 people pour new wine into new wineskins so that both are kept safe.\u201d","When Jesus turned and saw her
 he said
 \u201cBe encouraged
 daughter. Your faith has healed you.\u201d And the woman was healed from that time on.","He said
 \u201cGo away
 because the little girl isn\u2019t dead but is asleep\u201d; but they laughed at him.","When he came into the house
 the blind men approached him. Jesus said to them
 \u201cDo you believe I can do this?\u201d \u201cYes
 Lord
\u201d they replied.","Their eyes were opened. Then Jesus sternly warned them
 \u201cMake sure nobody knows about this.\u201d","Then he said to his disciples
 \u201cThe size of the harvest is bigger than you can imagine
 but there are few workers.","Therefore
 plead with the Lord of the harvest to send out workers for his harvest.\u201d","Jesus sent these twelve out and commanded them
 \u201cDon\u2019t go among the Gentiles or into a Samaritan city.","Go instead to the lost sheep
 the people of Israel.","As you go
 make this announcement: \u2018The kingdom of heaven has come near.\u2019","Heal the sick
 raise the dead
 cleanse those with skin diseases

 give without demanding payment.","Workers deserve to be fed
 so don\u2019t gather gold or silver or copper coins for your money belts to take on your trips.","Don\u2019t take a backpack for the road or two shirts or sandals or a walking stick.","Whatever city or village you go into
 find somebody in it who is worthy and stay there until you go on your way.","When you go into a house
 say
 \u2018Peace!\u2019","If the house is worthy
 give it your blessing of peace. But if the house isn\u2019t worthy
 take back your blessing.","If anyone refuses to welcome you or listen to your words
 shake the dust off your feet as you leave that house or city.","I assure you that it will be more bearable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah on Judgment Day than it will be for that city.","\u201cLook
 I\u2019m sending you as sheep among wolves. Therefore
 be wise as snakes and innocent as doves.","Watch out for people\u2014because they will hand you over to councils and they will beat you in their synagogues.","They will haul you in front of governors and even kings because of me so that you may give your testimony to them and to the Gentiles.","Whenever they hand you over
 don\u2019t worry about how to speak or what you will say
 because what you can say will be given to you at that moment.","You aren\u2019t doing the talking
 but the Spirit of my Father is doing the talking through you.","Brothers and sisters will hand each other over to be executed. A father will turn his child in. Children will defy their parents and have them executed.","Everyone will hate you on account of my name. But whoever stands firm until the end will be saved.","Whenever they harass you in one city
 escape to the next
 because I assure that you will not go through all the cities of Israel before the Human One comes.","\u201cDisciples aren\u2019t greater than their teacher
 and slaves aren\u2019t greater than their master.","It\u2019s enough for disciples to be like their teacher and slaves like their master. If they have called the head of the house Beelzebul
 it\u2019s certain that they will call the members of his household by even worse names.","\u201cTherefore
 don\u2019t be afraid of those people because nothing is hidden that won\u2019t be revealed
 and nothing secret that won\u2019t be brought out into the open.","What I say to you in the darkness
 tell in the light; and what you hear whispered
 announce from the rooftops.","Don\u2019t be afraid of those who kill the body but can\u2019t kill the soul. Instead
 be afraid of the one who can destroy both body and soul in hell.","Aren\u2019t two sparrows sold for a small coin? But not one of them will fall to the ground without your Father knowing about it already.","Even the hairs of your head are all counted.","Don\u2019t be afraid. You are worth more than many sparrows.","\u201cTherefore
 everyone who acknowledges me before people
 I also will acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven.","But everyone who denies me before people
 I also will deny before my Father who is in heaven.","\u201cDon\u2019t think that I\u2019ve come to bring peace to the earth. I haven\u2019t come to bring peace but a sword.","I\u2019ve come to turn a man against his father
 a daughter against her mother
 and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.","People\u2019s enemies are members of their own households.","\u201cThose who love father or mother more than me aren\u2019t worthy of me.

 and those who lose their lives because of me will find them.","\u201cThose who receive you are also receiving me
 and those who receive me are receiving the one who sent me.","Those who receive a prophet as a prophet will receive a prophet\u2019s reward.

 \u201cGo
 report to John what you hear and see.","Those who were blind are able to see. Those who were crippled are walking. People with skin diseases are cleansed. Those who were deaf now hear. Those who were dead are raised up. The poor have good news proclaimed to them.","Happy are those who don\u2019t stumble and fall because of me.\u201d","When John\u2019s disciples had gone
 Jesus spoke to the crowds about John: \u201cWhat did you go out to the wilderness to see? A stalk blowing in the wind?","What did you go out to see? A man dressed up in refined clothes? Look
 those who wear refined clothes are in royal palaces.","What did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes
 I tell you
 and more than a prophet.","He is the one of whom it is written: Look
 I\u2019m sending my messenger before you

Yet whoever is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.","From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven is violently attacked as violent people seize it.","All the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John came.","If you are willing to accept it
 he is Elijah who is to come.","Let the person who has ears
 hear.","\u201cTo what will I compare this generation? It is like a child sitting in the marketplaces calling out to others
","\u2018We played the flute for you and you didn\u2019t dance. We sang a funeral song and you didn\u2019t mourn.\u2019","For John came neither eating nor drinking
 and they say
 \u2018He has a demon.\u2019","Yet the Human One came eating and drinking
 and they say
 \u2018Look
 a glutton and a drunk
 a friend of tax collectors and sinners.\u2019 But wisdom is proved to be right by her works.\u201d","Then he began to scold the cities where he had done his greatest miracles because they didn\u2019t change their hearts and lives.","\u201cHow terrible it will be for you
 Chorazin! How terrible it will be for you
 Bethsaida! For if the miracles done among you had been done in Tyre and Sidon
 they would have changed their hearts and lives and put on funeral clothes and ashes a long time ago.","But I say to you that Tyre and Sidon will be better off on Judgment Day than you.","And you
 Capernaum
 will you be honored by being raised up to heaven? No
 you will be thrown down to the place of the dead. After all
 if the miracles that were done among you had been done in Sodom
 it would still be here today.","But I say to you that it will be better for the land of Sodom on the Judgment Day than it will be for you.\u201d","At that time Jesus said
 \u201cI praise you
 Father
 Lord of heaven and earth
 because you\u2019ve hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have shown them to babies.","Indeed
 Father
 this brings you happiness.","\u201cMy Father has handed all things over to me. No one knows the Son except the Father. And nobody knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son wants to reveal him.","\u201cCome to me
 all you who are struggling hard and carrying heavy loads
 and I will give you rest.","Put on my yoke
 and learn from me. I\u2019m gentle and humble. And you will find rest for yourselves.","My yoke is easy to bear
 and my burden is light.\u201d","But he said to them
 \u201cHaven\u2019t you read what David did when he and those with him were hungry?","He went into God\u2019s house and broke the law by eating the bread of the presence
 which only the priests were allowed to eat.","Or haven\u2019t you read in the Law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple treat the Sabbath as any other day and are still innocent?","But I tell you that something greater than the temple is here.","If you had known what this means
 I want mercy and not sacrifice
 you wouldn\u2019t have condemned the innocent.","The Human One is Lord of the Sabbath.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cWho among you has a sheep that falls into a pit on the Sabbath and will not take hold of it and pull it out?","How much more valuable is a person than a sheep! So the Law allows a person to do what is good on the Sabbath.\u201d","Then Jesus said to the man
 \u201cStretch out your hand.\u201d So he did and it was made healthy
 just like the other one.","Because Jesus knew what they were thinking
 he replied
 \u201cEvery kingdom involved in civil war becomes a wasteland. Every city or house torn apart by divisions will collapse.","If Satan throws out Satan
 he is at war with himself. How then can his kingdom endure?","And if I throw out demons by the authority of Beelzebul
 then by whose authority do your followers throw them out? Therefore
 they will be your judges.","But if I throw out demons by the power of God\u2019s Spirit
 then God\u2019s kingdom has already overtaken you.","Can people go into a house that belongs to a strong man and steal his possessions
 unless they first tie up the strong man? Then they can rob his house.","Whoever isn\u2019t with me is against me
 and whoever doesn\u2019t gather with me scatters.","\u201cTherefore
 I tell you that people will be forgiven for every sin and insult to God. But insulting the Holy Spirit won\u2019t be forgiven.","And whoever speaks a word against the Human One will be forgiven. But whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit won\u2019t be forgiven
 not in this age or in the age that is coming.","\u201cEither consider the tree good and its fruit good

What fills the heart comes out of the mouth.","Good people bring out good things from their good treasure. But evil people bring out evil things from their evil treasure.","I tell you that people will have to answer on Judgment Day for every useless word they speak.","By your words you will be either judged innocent or condemned as guilty.\u201d","But he replied
 \u201cAn evil and unfaithful generation searches for a sign
 but it won\u2019t receive any sign except Jonah\u2019s sign.","Just as Jonah was in the whale\u2019s belly for three days and three nights
 so the Human One will be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights.","The citizens of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it as guilty
 because they changed their hearts and lives in response to Jonah\u2019s preaching. And look
 someone greater than Jonah is here.","The queen of the South will be raised up by God at the judgment with this generation and condemn it because she came from a distant land to hear Solomon\u2019s wisdom. And look
 someone greater than Solomon is here.","\u201cWhen an unclean spirit leaves a person
 it wanders through dry places looking for a place to rest. But it doesn\u2019t find any.","Then it says
 \u2018I\u2019ll go back to the house I left.\u2019 When it arrives
 it finds the place vacant
 cleaned up
 and decorated.","Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more evil than itself. They go in and make their home there. That person is worse off at the end than at the beginning. This is the way it will be also for this evil generation.\u201d","While Jesus was speaking to the crowds
 his mother and brothers stood outside trying to speak with him.","Jesus replied
 \u201cWho is my mother? Who are my brothers?\u201d","He stretched out his hand toward his disciples and said
 \u201cLook
 here are my mother and my brothers.","Whoever does the will of my Father who is in heaven is my brother
 sister
 and mother.\u201d","He said many things to them in parables: \u201cA farmer went out to scatter seed.","As he was scattering seed
 some fell on the path
 and birds came and ate it.","Other seed fell on rocky ground where the soil was shallow. They sprouted immediately because the soil wasn\u2019t deep.","But when the sun came up
 it scorched the plants
 and they dried up because they had no roots.","Other seed fell among thorny plants. The thorny plants grew and choked them.","Other seed fell on good soil and bore fruit
 in one case a yield of one hundred to one
 in another case a yield of sixty to one
 and in another case a yield of thirty to one.","Everyone who has ears should pay attention.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cBecause they haven\u2019t received the secrets of the kingdom of heaven
 but you have.","For those who have will receive more and they will have more than enough. But as for those who don\u2019t have
 even the little they have will be taken away from them.","This is why I speak to the crowds in parables: although they see
 they don\u2019t really see; and although they hear
 they don\u2019t really hear or understand.","What Isaiah prophesied has become completely true for them: You will hear
 to be sure
 but never understand; and you will certainly see but never recognize what you are seeing.","For this people\u2019s senses have become calloused
 and they\u2019ve become hard of hearing
 and they\u2019ve shut their eyes so that they won\u2019t see with their eyes or hear with their ears or understand with their minds
 and change their hearts and lives that I may heal them.","\u201cHappy are your eyes because they see. Happy are your ears because they hear.","I assure you that many prophets and righteous people wanted to see what you see and hear what you hear
 but they didn\u2019t.","\u201cConsider then the parable of the farmer.","Whenever people hear the word about the kingdom and don\u2019t understand it
 the evil one comes and carries off what was planted in their hearts. This is the seed that was sown on the path.","As for the seed that was spread on rocky ground
 this refers to people who hear the word and immediately receive it joyfully.","Because they have no roots
 they last for only a little while. When they experience distress or abuse because of the word
 they immediately fall away.","As for the seed that was spread among thorny plants
 this refers to those who hear the word
 but the worries of this life and the false appeal of wealth choke the word
 and it bears no fruit.","As for what was planted on good soil
 this refers to those who hear and understand
 and bear fruit and produce\u2014in one case a yield of one hundred to one
 in another case a yield of sixty to one
 and in another case a yield of thirty to one.\u201d","Jesus told them another parable: \u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like someone who planted good seed in his field.","While people were sleeping
 an enemy came and planted weeds among the wheat and went away.","When the stalks sprouted and bore grain
 then the weeds also appeared.","\u201cThe servants of the landowner came and said to him
 \u2018Master
 didn\u2019t you plant good seed in your field? Then how is it that it has weeds?\u2019","\u201c\u2018An enemy has done this
\u2019 he answered. \u201cThe servants said to him
 \u2018Do you want us to go and gather them?\u2019","\u201cBut the landowner said
 \u2018No
 because if you gather the weeds
 you\u2019ll pull up the wheat along with them.","Let both grow side by side until the harvest. And at harvesttime I\u2019ll say to the harvesters
 \u201cFirst gather the weeds and tie them together in bundles to be burned. But bring the wheat into my barn.\u201d\u2019\u201d","He told another parable to them: \u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that someone took and planted in his field.","It\u2019s the smallest of all seeds. But when it\u2019s grown
 it\u2019s the largest of all vegetable plants. It becomes a tree so that the birds in the sky come and nest in its branches.\u201d","He told them another parable: \u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like yeast
 which a woman took and hid in a bushel of wheat flour until the yeast had worked its way through all the dough.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cThe one who plants the good seed is the Human One.","The field is the world. And the good seeds are the followers of the kingdom. But the weeds are the followers of the evil one.","The enemy who planted them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the present age. The harvesters are the angels.","Just as people gather weeds and burn them in the fire
 so it will be at the end of the present age.","The Human One will send his angels
 and they will gather out of his kingdom all things that cause people to fall away and all people who sin.","He will throw them into a burning furnace. People there will be weeping and grinding their teeth.","Then the righteous will shine like the sun in their Father\u2019s kingdom. Those who have ears should hear.\u201d","\u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like a treasure that somebody hid in a field
 which someone else found and covered up. Full of joy
 the finder sold everything and bought that field.","\u201cAgain
 the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls.","When he found one very precious pearl
 he went and sold all that he owned and bought it.","\u201cAgain
 the kingdom of heaven is like a net that people threw into the lake and gathered all kinds of fish.","When it was full
 they pulled it to the shore
 where they sat down and put the good fish together into containers. But the bad fish they threw away.","That\u2019s the way it will be at the end of the present age. The angels will go out and separate the evil people from the righteous people
","and will throw the evil ones into a burning furnace. People there will be weeping and grinding their teeth.","\u201cHave you understood all these things?\u201dJesus asked. They said to him
 \u201cYes.\u201d","Then he said to them
 \u201cTherefore
 every legal expert who has been trained as a disciple for the kingdom of heaven is like the head of a household who brings old and new things out of their treasure chest.\u201d","They were repulsed by him and fell into sin. But Jesus said to them
 \u201cProphets are honored everywhere except in their own hometowns and in their own households.\u201d","But Jesus said to them
 \u201cThere\u2019s no need to send them away. You give them something to eat.\u201d","He said
 \u201cBring them here to me.\u201d","Just then Jesus spoke to them
 \u201cBe encouraged! It\u2019s me. Don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d","And Jesus said
 \u201cCome.\u201d Then Peter got out of the boat and was walking on the water toward Jesus.","Jesus immediately reached out and grabbed him
 saying
 \u201cYou man of weak faith! Why did you begin to have doubts?\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cWhy do you break the command of God by keeping the rules handed down to you?","For God said
 Honor your father and your mother
 and The person who speaks against father or mother will certainly be put to death.","But you say
 \u2018If you tell your father or mother
 \u201cEverything I\u2019m expected to contribute to you I\u2019m giving to God as a gift
\u201dthen you don\u2019t have to honor your father.\u2019","So you do away with God\u2019s Law for the sake of the rules that have been handed down to you.","Hypocrites! Isaiah really knew what he was talking about when he prophesied about you
","This people honors me with their lips
 but their hearts are far away from me.","Their worship of me is empty since they teach instructions that are human rules.\u201d","Jesus called the crowd near and said to them
 \u201cListen and understand.","It\u2019s not what goes into the mouth that contaminates a person in God\u2019s sight. It\u2019s what comes out of the mouth that contaminates the person.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cEvery plant that my heavenly Father didn\u2019t plant will be pulled up.","Leave the Pharisees alone. They are blind people who are guides to blind people. But if a blind person leads another blind person
 they will both fall into a ditch.\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cDon\u2019t you understand yet?","Don\u2019t you know that everything that goes into the mouth enters the stomach and goes out into the sewer?","But what goes out of the mouth comes from the heart. And that\u2019s what contaminates a person in God\u2019s sight.","Out of the heart come evil thoughts
 murders
 adultery
 sexual sins
 thefts
 false testimonies
 and insults.","These contaminate a person in God\u2019s sight. But eating without washing hands doesn\u2019t contaminate in God\u2019s sight.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cI\u2019ve been sent only to the lost sheep
 the people of Israel.\u201d","He replied
 \u201cIt is not good to take the children\u2019s bread and toss it to dogs.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cWoman
 you have great faith. It will be just as you wish.\u201d And right then her daughter was healed.","Now Jesus called his disciples and said
 \u201cI feel sorry for the crowd because they have been with me for three days and have nothing to eat. I don\u2019t want to send them away hungry for fear they won\u2019t have enough strength to travel.\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cHow much bread do you have?\u201d They responded
 \u201cSeven loaves and a few fish.\u201d","But he replied
 \u201cAt evening you say
 \u2018It will be nice weather because the sky is bright red.\u2019","And in the morning you say
 \u2018There will be bad weather today because the sky is cloudy.\u2019 You know how to make sense of the sky\u2019s appearance. But you are unable to recognize the signs that point to what the time is.","An evil and unfaithful generation searches for a sign. But it won\u2019t receive any sign except Jonah\u2019s sign.\u201d Then he left them and went away.","Jesus said to them
 \u201cWatch out and be on your guard for the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\u201d","Jesus knew what they were discussing and said
 \u201cYou people of weak faith! Why are you discussing among yourselves the fact that you don\u2019t have any bread?","Don\u2019t you understand yet? Don\u2019t you remember the five loaves that fed the five thousand and how many baskets of leftovers you gathered?","And the seven loaves that fed the four thousand and how many large baskets of leftovers you gathered?","Don\u2019t you know that I wasn\u2019t talking about bread? But be on your guard for the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\u201d","Now when Jesus came to the area of Caesarea Philippi
 he asked his disciples
 \u201cWho do people say the Human One is?\u201d","He said
 \u201cAnd what about you? Who do you say that I am?\u201d","Then Jesus replied
 \u201cHappy are you
 Simon son of Jonah

The gates of the underworld won\u2019t be able to stand against it.","I\u2019ll give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Anything you fasten on earth will be fastened in heaven. Anything you loosen on earth will be loosened in heaven.\u201d","But he turned to Peter and said
 \u201cGet behind me
 Satan. You are a stone that could make me stumble
 for you are not thinking God\u2019s thoughts but human thoughts.\u201d","Then Jesus said to his disciples
 \u201cAll who want to come after me must say no to themselves
 take up their cross
 and follow me.","All who want to save their lives will lose them. But all who lose their lives because of me will find them.","Why would people gain the whole world but lose their lives? What will people give in exchange for their lives?","For the Human One is about to come with the majesty of his Father with his angels. And then he will repay each one for what that person has done.","I assure you that some standing here won\u2019t die before they see the Human One coming in his kingdom.\u201d","But Jesus came and touched them. \u201cGet up
\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid.\u201d","As they were coming down the mountain
 Jesus commanded them
 \u201cDon\u2019t tell anybody about the vision until the Human One is raised from the dead.\u201d","Jesus responded
 \u201cElijah does come first and will restore all things.","In fact
 I tell you that Elijah has already come
 and they didn\u2019t know him. But they did to him whatever they wanted. In the same way the Human One is also going to suffer at their hands.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cYou faithless and crooked generation
 how long will I be with you? How long will I put up with you? Bring the boy here to me.\u201d","\u201cBecause you have little faith
\u201d he said. \u201cI assure you that if you have faith the size of a mustard seed
 you could say to this mountain
 \u2018Go from here to there
\u2019 and it will go. There will be nothing that you can\u2019t do.\u201d","When the disciples came together in Galilee
 Jesus said to them
 \u201cThe Human One is about to be delivered over into human hands.","They will kill him. But he will be raised on the third day.\u201d And they were heartbroken.","\u201cYes
\u201d he said. But when they came into the house
 Jesus spoke to Peter first.\u201cWhat do you think
 Simon? From whom do earthly kings collect taxes
 from their children or from strangers?\u201d","\u201cFrom strangers
\u201d he said. Jesus said to him
 \u201cThen the children don\u2019t have to pay.","But just so we don\u2019t offend them
 go to the lake
 throw out a fishing line and hook
 and take the first fish you catch. When you open its mouth
 you will find a shekel coin. Take it and pay the tax for both of us.\u201d","and said
 \u201cI assure you that if you don\u2019t turn your lives around and become like this little child
 you will definitely not enter the kingdom of heaven.","Those who humble themselves like this little child will be the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.","Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me.","\u201cAs for whoever causes these little ones who believe in me to trip and fall into sin
 it would be better for them to have a huge stone hung around their necks and be drowned in the bottom of the lake.","How terrible it is for the world because of the things that cause people to trip and fall into sin! Such things have to happen
 but how terrible it is for the person who causes those things to happen!","If your hand or your foot causes you to fall into sin
 chop it off and throw it away. It\u2019s better to enter into life crippled or lame than to be thrown into the eternal fire with two hands or two feet.","If your eye causes you to fall into sin
 tear it out and throw it away. It\u2019s better to enter into life with one eye than to be cast into a burning hell with two eyes.","\u201cBe careful that you don\u2019t look down on one of these little ones. I say to you that their angels in heaven are always looking into the face of my Father who is in heaven.","What do you think? If someone had one hundred sheep and one of them wandered off
 wouldn\u2019t he leave the ninety-nine on the hillsides and go in search for the one that wandered off?","If he finds it
 I assure you that he is happier about having that one sheep than about the ninety-nine who didn\u2019t wander off.","In the same way
 my Father who is in heaven doesn\u2019t want to lose one of these little ones.","\u201cIf your brother or sister sins against you
 go and correct them when you are alone together. If they listen to you
 then you\u2019ve won over your brother or sister.","But if they won\u2019t listen
 take with you one or two others so that every word may be established by the mouth of two or three witnesses.","But if they still won\u2019t pay attention
 report it to the church. If they won\u2019t pay attention even to the church
 treat them as you would a Gentile and tax collector.","I assure you that whatever you fasten on earth will be fastened in heaven. And whatever you loosen on earth will be loosened in heaven.","Again I assure you that if two of you agree on earth about anything you ask
 then my Father who is in heaven will do it for you.","For where two or three are gathered in my name
 I\u2019m there with them.\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cNot just seven times
 but rather as many as seventy-seven times.","Therefore
 the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.","When he began to settle accounts
 they brought to him a servant who owed him ten thousand bags of gold.","Because the servant didn\u2019t have enough to pay it back
 the master ordered that he should be sold
 along with his wife and children and everything he had
 and that the proceeds should be used as payment.","But the servant fell down
 kneeled before him
 and said
 \u2018Please
 be patient with me
 and I\u2019ll pay you back.\u2019","The master had compassion on that servant
 released him
 and forgave the loan.","\u201cWhen that servant went out
 he found one of his fellow servants who owed him one hundred coins. He grabbed him around the throat and said
 \u2018Pay me back what you owe me.\u2019","\u201cThen his fellow servant fell down and begged him
 \u2018Be patient with me
 and I\u2019ll pay you back.\u2019","But he refused. Instead
 he threw him into prison until he paid back his debt.","\u201cWhen his fellow servants saw what happened
 they were deeply offended. They came and told their master all that happened.","His master called the first servant and said
 \u2018You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you appealed to me.","Shouldn\u2019t you also have mercy on your fellow servant
 just as I had mercy on you?\u2019","His master was furious and handed him over to the guard responsible for punishing prisoners
 until he had paid the whole debt.","\u201cMy heavenly Father will also do the same to you if you don\u2019t forgive your brother or sister from your heart.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cHaven\u2019t you read that at the beginning the creator made them male and female?","And God said
 \u2018Because of this a man should leave his father and mother and be joined together with his wife
 and the two will be one flesh.\u2019","So they are no longer two but one flesh. Therefore
 humans must not pull apart what God has put together.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cMoses allowed you to divorce your wives because your hearts are unyielding. But it wasn\u2019t that way from the beginning.","I say to you that whoever divorces his wife
 except for sexual unfaithfulness
 and marries another woman commits adultery.\u201d","He replied
 \u201cNot everybody can accept this teaching
 but only those who have received the ability to accept it.","For there are eunuchs who have been eunuchs from birth. And there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by other people. And there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs because of the kingdom of heaven. Those who can accept it should accept it.\u201d","\u201cAllow the children to come to me
\u201d Jesus said. \u201cDon\u2019t forbid them
 because the kingdom of heaven belongs to people like these children.\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cWhy do you ask me about what is good? There\u2019s only one who is good. If you want to enter eternal life
 keep the commandments.\u201d","The man said
 \u201cWhich ones?\u201d Then Jesus said
 \u201cDon\u2019t commit murder. Don\u2019t commit adultery. Don\u2019t steal. Don\u2019t give false testimony.","Honor your father and mother
 and love your neighbor as you love yourself.\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cIf you want to be complete
 go
 sell what you own
 and give the money to the poor. Then you will have treasure in heaven. And come follow me.\u201d","Then Jesus said to his disciples
 \u201cI assure you that it will be very hard for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven.","In fact
 it\u2019s easier for a camel to squeeze through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter God\u2019s kingdom.\u201d","Jesus looked at them carefully and said
 \u201cIt\u2019s impossible for human beings. But all things are possible for God.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cI assure you who have followed me that
 when everything is made new
 when the Human One sits on his magnificent throne
 you also will sit on twelve thrones overseeing the twelve tribes of Israel.","And all who have left houses
 brothers
 sisters
 father
 mother
 children
 or farms because of my name will receive one hundred times more and will inherit eternal life.","But many who are first will be last. And many who are last will be first.","\u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.","After he agreed with the workers to pay them a denarion
 he sent them into his vineyard.","\u201cThen he went out around nine in the morning and saw others standing around the marketplace doing nothing.","He said to them
 \u2018You also go into the vineyard
 and I\u2019ll pay you whatever is right.\u2019","And they went. \u201cAgain around noon and then at three in the afternoon
 he did the same thing.","Around five in the afternoon he went and found others standing around
 and he said to them
 \u2018Why are you just standing around here doing nothing all day long?\u2019","\u201c\u2018Because nobody has hired us
\u2019 they replied. \u201cHe responded
 \u2018You also go into the vineyard.\u2019","\u201cWhen evening came
 the owner of the vineyard said to his manager
 \u2018Call the workers and give them their wages
 beginning with the last ones hired and moving on finally to the first.\u2019","When those who were hired at five in the afternoon came
 each one received a denarion.","Now when those hired first came
 they thought they would receive more. But each of them also received a denarion.","When they received it
 they grumbled against the landowner
","\u2018These who were hired last worked one hour
 and they received the same pay as we did even though we had to work the whole day in the hot sun.\u2019","\u201cBut he replied to one of them
 \u2018Friend
 I did you no wrong. Didn\u2019t I agree to pay you a denarion?","Take what belongs to you and go. I want to give to this one who was hired last the same as I give to you.","Don\u2019t I have the right to do what I want with what belongs to me? Or are you resentful because I\u2019m generous?\u2019","So those who are last will be first. And those who are first will be last.\u201d","\u201cLook
 we are going up to Jerusalem. The Human One will be handed over to the chief priests and legal experts. They will condemn him to death.","They will hand him over to the Gentiles to be ridiculed
 tortured
 and crucified. But he will be raised on the third day.\u201d","\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d he asked. She responded
 \u201cSay that these two sons of mine will sit
 one on your right hand and one on your left
 in your kingdom.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re asking! Can you drink from the cup that I\u2019m about to drink from?\u201d They said to him
 \u201cWe can.\u201d","But Jesus called them over and said
 \u201cYou know that those who rule the Gentiles show off their authority over them and their high-ranking officials order them around.","But that\u2019s not the way it will be with you. Whoever wants to be great among you will be your servant.","Whoever wants to be first among you will be your slave\u2014","just as the Human One didn\u2019t come to be served but rather to serve and to give his life to liberate many people.\u201d","Jesus stopped in his tracks and called to them. \u201cWhat do you want me to do for you?\u201d he asked.","He said to them
 \u201cGo into the village over there. As soon as you enter
 you will find a donkey tied up and a colt with it. Untie them and bring them to me.","If anyone says anything to you
 say that their master needs them.\u201d He sent them off right away.","He said to them
 \u201cIt\u2019s written
 My house will be called a house of prayer. But you\u2019ve made it a hideout for crooks.\u201d","They said to Jesus
 \u201cDo you hear what these children are saying?\u201d \u201cYes
\u201d he answered. \u201cHaven\u2019t you ever read
 From the mouths of babies and infants you\u2019ve arranged praise for yourself? \u201d","He saw a fig tree along the road
 but when he came to it
 he found nothing except leaves. Then he said to it
 \u201cYou\u2019ll never again bear fruit!\u201d The fig tree dried up at once.","Jesus responded
 \u201cI assure you that if you have faith and don\u2019t doubt
 you will not only do what was done to the fig tree. You will even say to this mountain
 \u2018Be lifted up and thrown into the lake.\u2019 And it will happen.","If you have faith
 you will receive whatever you pray for.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cI have a question for you. If you tell me the answer
 I\u2019ll tell you what kind of authority I have to do these things.","Where did John get his authority to baptize? Did he get it from heaven or from humans?\u201d They argued among themselves
 \u201cIf we say \u2018from heaven

 \u2018Then why didn\u2019t you believe him?\u2019","Then they replied
 \u201cWe don\u2019t know.\u201d Jesus also said to them
 \u201cNeither will I tell you what kind of authority I have to do these things.","\u201cWhat do you think? A man had two sons. Now he came to the first and said
 \u2018Son
 go and work in the vineyard today.\u2019","\u201c\u2018No

 and you didn\u2019t believe him. But tax collectors and prostitutes believed him. Yet even after you saw this
 you didn\u2019t change your hearts and lives and you didn\u2019t believe him.","\u201cListen to another parable. There was a landowner who planted a vineyard. He put a fence around it
 dug a winepress in it
 and built a tower. Then he rented it to tenant farmers and took a trip.","When it was time for harvest
 he sent his servants to the tenant farmers to collect his fruit.","But the tenant farmers grabbed his servants. They beat some of them
 and some of them they killed. Some of them they stoned to death.","\u201cAgain he sent other servants
 more than the first group. They treated them in the same way.","Finally he sent his son to them. \u2018They will respect my son
\u2019 he said.","\u201cBut when the tenant farmers saw the son
 they said to each other
 \u2018This is the heir. Come on
 let\u2019s kill him and we\u2019ll have his inheritance.\u2019","They grabbed him
 threw him out of the vineyard
 and killed him.","\u201cWhen the owner of the vineyard comes
 what will he do to those tenant farmers?\u201d","They said
 \u201cHe will totally destroy those wicked farmers and rent the vineyard to other tenant farmers who will give him the fruit when it\u2019s ready.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cHaven\u2019t you ever read in the scriptures
 The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone. The Lord has done this
 and it\u2019s amazing in our eyes?","Therefore
 I tell you that God\u2019s kingdom will be taken away from you and will be given to a people who produce its fruit.","Whoever falls on this stone will be crushed.

 go to the roads on the edge of town and invite everyone you find to the wedding party.\u2019","\u201cThen those servants went to the roads and gathered everyone they found

 the gold or the temple that makes the gold holy?","You say
 \u2018If people swear by the altar
 it\u2019s nothing. But if they swear by the gift on the altar
 they are obligated to do what they swore.\u2019","You blind people! Which is greater
 the gift or the altar that makes the gift holy?","Therefore
 those who swear by the altar swear by it and by everything that\u2019s on it.","Those who swear by the temple swear by it and by everything that\u2019s part of it.","Those who swear by heaven swear by God\u2019s throne and by the one who sits on it.","\u201cHow terrible it will be for you legal experts and Pharisees! Hypocrites! You give to God a tenth of mint
 dill
 and cumin
 but you forget about the more important matters of the Law: justice
 peace
 and faith. You ought to give a tenth but without forgetting about those more important matters.","You blind guides! You filter out an ant but swallow a camel.","\u201cHow terrible it will be for you legal experts and Pharisees! Hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and plate
 but inside they are full of violence and pleasure seeking.","Blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup so that the outside of the cup will be clean too.","\u201cHow terrible it will be for you legal experts and Pharisees! Hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs. They look beautiful on the outside. But inside they are full of dead bones and all kinds of filth.","In the same way you look righteous to people. But inside you are full of pretense and rebellion.","\u201cHow terrible it will be for you legal experts and Pharisees! Hypocrites! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous.","You say
 \u2018If we had lived in our ancestors\u2019 days
 we wouldn\u2019t have joined them in killing the prophets.\u2019","You testify against yourselves that you are children of those who murdered the prophets.","Go ahead
 complete what your ancestors did.","You snakes! You children of snakes! How will you be able to escape the judgment of hell?","Therefore
 look
 I\u2019m sending you prophets
 wise people
 and legal experts. Some of them you will kill and crucify. And some you will beat in your synagogues and chase from city to city.","Therefore
 upon you will come all the righteous blood that has been poured out on the earth
 from the blood of that righteous man Abel to the blood of Zechariah the son of Barachiah
 whom you killed between the temple and the altar.","I assure you that all these things will come upon this generation.","\u201cJerusalem
 Jerusalem! You who kill the prophets and stone those who were sent to you. How often I wanted to gather your people together
 just as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings. But you didn\u2019t want that.","Look
 your house is left to you deserted.","I tell you
 you won\u2019t see me until you say
 Blessings on the one who comes in the Lord\u2019s name.\u201d","He responded
 \u201cDo you see all these things? I assure that no stone will be left on another. Everything will be demolished.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cWatch out that no one deceives you.","Many will come in my name

 \u2018I\u2019m the Christ.\u2019 They will deceive many people.","You will hear about wars and reports of wars. Don\u2019t be alarmed. These things must happen
 but this isn\u2019t the end yet.","Nations and kingdoms will fight against each other
 and there will be famines and earthquakes in all sorts of places.","But all these things are just the beginning of the sufferings associated with the end.","They will arrest you
 abuse you

 the love of many will grow cold.","But the one who endures to the end will be delivered.","This gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the world as a testimony to all the nations. Then the end will come.","\u201cWhen you see the disgusting and destructive thing that Daniel talked about standing in the holy place (the reader should understand this)
","then those in Judea must escape to the mountains.","Those on the roof shouldn\u2019t come down to grab things from their houses.","Those in the field shouldn\u2019t come back to grab their clothes.","How terrible it will be at that time for women who are pregnant and for women who are nursing their children.","Pray that it doesn\u2019t happen in winter or on the Sabbath day.","There will be great suffering such as the world has never before seen and will never again see.","If that time weren\u2019t shortened
 nobody would be rescued. But for the sake of the ones whom God chose
 that time will be cut short.","\u201cThen if somebody says to you
 \u2018Look
 here\u2019s the Christ
\u2019 or \u2018He\u2019s over here
\u2019 don\u2019t believe it.","False christs and false prophets will appear
 and they will offer great signs and wonders in order to deceive
 if possible

 I\u2019ve told you ahead of time.","So if they say to you

 he\u2019s in the desert
\u2019 don\u2019t go out. And if they say
 \u2018Look
 he\u2019s in the rooms deep inside the house
\u2019 don\u2019t believe it.","Just as the lightning flashes from the east to the west
 so it will be with the coming of the Human One.","The vultures gather wherever there\u2019s a dead body.","\u201cNow immediately after the suffering of that time the sun will become dark
 and the moon won\u2019t give its light. The stars will fall from the sky and the planets and other heavenly bodies will be shaken.","Then the sign of the Human One will appear in the sky. At that time all the tribes of the earth will be full of sadness
 and they will see the Human One coming in the heavenly clouds with power and great splendor.","He will send his angels with the sound of a great trumpet
 and they will gather his chosen ones from the four corners of the earth
 from one end of the sky to the other.","\u201cLearn this parable from the fig tree. After its branch becomes tender and it sprouts new leaves
 you know that summer is near.","In the same way
 when you see all these things
 you know that the Human One is near
 at the door.","I assure you that this generation won\u2019t pass away until all these things happen.","Heaven and earth will pass away
 but my words will certainly not pass away.","\u201cBut nobody knows when that day or hour will come
 not the heavenly angels and not the Son. Only the Father knows.","As it was in the time of Noah
 so it will be at the coming of the Human One.","In those days before the flood
 people were eating and drinking
 marrying and giving in marriage
 until the day Noah entered the ark.","They didn\u2019t know what was happening until the flood came and swept them all away. The coming of the Human One will be like that.","At that time there will be two men in the field. One will be taken and the other left.","Two women will be grinding at the mill. One will be taken and the other left.","Therefore
 stay alert! You don\u2019t know what day the Lord is coming.","But you understand that if the head of the house knew at what time the thief would come
 he would keep alert and wouldn\u2019t allow the thief to break into his house.","Therefore
 you also should be prepared
 because the Human One will come at a time you don\u2019t know.","\u201cWho then are the faithful and wise servants whom their master puts in charge of giving food at the right time to those who live in his house?","Happy are those servants whom the master finds fulfilling their responsibilities when he comes.","I assure you that he will put them in charge of all his possessions.","But suppose those bad servants should say to themselves
 My master won\u2019t come until later.","And suppose they began to beat their fellow servants and to eat and drink with the drunks?","The master of those servants will come on a day when they are not expecting him
 at a time they couldn\u2019t predict.","He will cut them in pieces and put them in a place with the hypocrites. People there will be weeping and grinding their teeth.","\u201cAt that time the kingdom of heaven will be like ten young bridesmaids who took their lamps and went out to meet the groom.","Now five of them were wise
 and the other five were foolish.","The foolish ones took their lamps but didn\u2019t bring oil for them.","But the wise ones took their lamps and also brought containers of oil.","\u201cWhen the groom was late in coming
 they all became drowsy and went to sleep.","But at midnight there was a cry
 \u2018Look
 the groom! Come out to meet him.\u2019","\u201cThen all those bridesmaids got up and prepared their lamps.","But the foolish bridesmaids said to the wise ones
 \u2018Give us some of your oil
 because our lamps have gone out.\u2019","\u201cBut the wise bridesmaids replied
 \u2018No
 because if we share with you
 there won\u2019t be enough for our lamps and yours. We have a better idea. You go to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves.\u2019","But while they were gone to buy oil
 the groom came. Those who were ready went with him into the wedding. Then the door was shut.","\u201cLater the other bridesmaids came and said
 \u2018Lord
 lord
 open the door for us.\u2019","\u201cBut he replied
 \u2018I tell you the truth
 I don\u2019t know you.\u2019","\u201cTherefore
 keep alert
 because you don\u2019t know the day or the hour.","\u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like a man who was leaving on a trip. He called his servants and handed his possessions over to them.","To one he gave five valuable coins
 and to another he gave two
 and to another he gave one. He gave to each servant according to that servant\u2019s ability. Then he left on his journey.","\u201cAfter the man left
 the servant who had five valuable coins took them and went to work doing business with them. He gained five more.","In the same way
 the one who had two valuable coins gained two more.","But the servant who had received the one valuable coin dug a hole in the ground and buried his master\u2019s money.","\u201cNow after a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them.","The one who had received five valuable coins came forward with five additional coins. He said
 \u2018Master
 you gave me five valuable coins. Look
 I\u2019ve gained five more.\u2019","\u201cHis master replied
 \u2018Excellent! You are a good and faithful servant! You\u2019ve been faithful over a little. I\u2019ll put you in charge of much. Come
 celebrate with me.\u2019","\u201cThe second servant also came forward and said
 \u2018Master
 you gave me two valuable coins. Look
 I\u2019ve gained two more.\u2019","\u201cHis master replied
 \u2018Well done! You are a good and faithful servant. You\u2019ve been faithful over a little. I\u2019ll put you in charge of much. Come
 celebrate with me.\u2019","\u201cNow the one who had received one valuable coin came and said
 \u2018Master
 I knew that you are a hard man. You harvest grain where you haven\u2019t sown. You gather crops where you haven\u2019t spread seed.","So I was afraid. And I hid my valuable coin in the ground. Here
 you have what\u2019s yours.\u2019","\u201cHis master replied
 \u2018You evil and lazy servant! You knew that I harvest grain where I haven\u2019t sown and that I gather crops where I haven\u2019t spread seed?","In that case
 you should have turned my money over to the bankers so that when I returned
 you could give me what belonged to me with interest.","Therefore
 take from him the valuable coin and give it to the one who has ten coins.","Those who have much will receive more
 and they will have more than they need. But as for those who don\u2019t have much
 even the little bit they have will be taken away from them.","Now take the worthless servant and throw him out into the farthest darkness.\u2019 \u201cPeople there will be weeping and grinding their teeth.","\u201cNow when the Human One comes in his majesty and all his angels are with him
 he will sit on his majestic throne.","All the nations will be gathered in front of him. He will separate them from each other
 just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.","He will put the sheep on his right side. But the goats he will put on his left.","\u201cThen the king will say to those on his right
 \u2018Come
 you who will receive good things from my Father. Inherit the kingdom that was prepared for you before the world began.","I was hungry and you gave me food to eat. I was thirsty and you gave me a drink. I was a stranger and you welcomed me.","I was naked and you gave me clothes to wear. I was sick and you took care of me. I was in prison and you visited me.\u2019","\u201cThen those who are righteous will reply to him
 \u2018Lord
 when did we see you hungry and feed you
 or thirsty and give you a drink?","When did we see you as a stranger and welcome you
 or naked and give you clothes to wear?","When did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?\u2019","\u201cThen the king will reply to them
 \u2018I assure you that when you have done it for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine
 you have done it for me.\u2019","\u201cThen he will say to those on his left
 \u2018Get away from me
 you who will receive terrible things. Go into the unending fire that has been prepared for the devil and his angels.","I was hungry and you didn\u2019t give me food to eat. I was thirsty and you didn\u2019t give me anything to drink.","I was a stranger and you didn\u2019t welcome me. I was naked and you didn\u2019t give me clothes to wear. I was sick and in prison
 and you didn\u2019t visit me.\u2019","\u201cThen they will reply
 \u2018Lord
 when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and didn\u2019t do anything to help you?\u2019","Then he will answer
 \u2018I assure you that when you haven\u2019t done it for one of the least of these
 you haven\u2019t done it for me.\u2019","And they will go away into eternal punishment. But the righteous ones will go into eternal life.\u201d","\u201cYou know that the Passover is two days from now. And the Human One will be handed over to be crucified.\u201d","But Jesus knew what they were thinking. He said
 \u201cWhy do you make trouble for the woman? She\u2019s done a good thing for me.","You always have the poor with you
 but you won\u2019t always have me.","By pouring this perfume over my body she\u2019s prepared me to be buried.","I tell you the truth that wherever in the whole world this good news is announced
 what she\u2019s done will also be told in memory of her.\u201d","He replied
 \u201cGo into the city
 to a certain man
 and say
 \u2018The teacher says
 \u201cMy time is near. I\u2019m going to celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your house.\u201d\u2019\u201d","As they were eating he said
 \u201cI assure you that one of you will betray me.\u201d","He replied
 \u201cThe one who will betray me is the one who dips his hand with me into this bowl.","The Human One goes to his death just as it is written about him. But how terrible it is for that person who betrays the Human One! It would have been better for him if he had never been born.\u201d","Now Judas
 who would betray him
 replied
 \u201cIt\u2019s not me
 is it
 Rabbi?\u201d Jesus answered
 \u201cYou said it.\u201d","While they were eating
 Jesus took bread
 blessed it
 broke it
 and gave it to the disciples and said
 \u201cTake and eat. This is my body.\u201d","He took a cup
 gave thanks
 and gave it to them
 saying
 \u201cDrink from this
 all of you.","This is my blood of the covenant
 which is poured out for many so that their sins may be forgiven.","I tell you
 I won\u2019t drink wine again until that day when I drink it in a new way with you in my Father\u2019s kingdom.\u201d","Then Jesus said to his disciples
 \u201cTonight you will all fall away because of me. This is because it is written
 I will hit the shepherd
 and the sheep of the flock will go off in all directions.","But after I\u2019m raised up
 I\u2019ll go before you to Galilee.\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cI assure you that
 before the rooster crows tonight
 you will deny me three times.\u201d","Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane. He said to the disciples
 \u201cStay here while I go and pray over there.\u201d","Then he said to them
 \u201cI\u2019m very sad. It\u2019s as if I\u2019m dying. Stay here and keep alert with me.\u201d","Then he went a short distance farther and fell on his face and prayed
 \u201cMy Father
 if it\u2019s possible
 take this cup of suffering away from me. However\u2014not what I want but what you want.\u201d","He came back to the disciples and found them sleeping. He said to Peter
 \u201cCouldn\u2019t you stay alert one hour with me?","Stay alert and pray so that you won\u2019t give in to temptation. The spirit is eager
 but the flesh is weak.\u201d","A second time he went away and prayed
 \u201cMy Father
 if it\u2019s not possible that this cup be taken away unless I drink it
 then let it be what you want.\u201d","Then he came to his disciples and said to them
 \u201cWill you sleep and rest all night? Look
 the time has come for the Human One to be betrayed into the hands of sinners.","Get up. Let\u2019s go. Look
 here comes my betrayer.\u201d","But Jesus said to him
 \u201cFriend
 do what you came to do.\u201d Then they came and grabbed Jesus and arrested him.","Then Jesus said to him
 \u201cPut the sword back into its place. All those who use the sword will die by the sword.","Or do you think that I\u2019m not able to ask my Father and he will send to me more than twelve battle groups of angels right away?","But if I did that
 how would the scriptures be fulfilled that say this must happen?\u201d","Then Jesus said to the crowds
 \u201cHave you come with swords and clubs to arrest me
 like a thief? Day after day
 I sat in the temple teaching
 but you didn\u2019t arrest me.","But all this has happened so that what the prophets said in the scriptures might be fulfilled.\u201d Then all the disciples left Jesus and ran away.","\u201cYou said it
\u201d Jesus replied. \u201cBut I say to you that from now on you\u2019ll see the Human One sitting on the right side of the Almighty and coming on the heavenly clouds.\u201d","Peter remembered Jesus\u2019 words
 \u201cBefore the rooster crows you will deny me three times.\u201dAnd Peter went out and cried uncontrollably.","Jesus was brought before the governor. The governor said
 \u201cAre you the king of the Jews?\u201d Jesus replied

 \u201cEli

 go and make disciples of all nations

 \u201cFor now this is how it should be

 \u201cGo away Satan! The Scriptures say: \u2018Worship the Lord your God and serve only him.\u2019\u201d","Then Jesus started preaching

 how can it make food salty? All it is good for is to be thrown out and walked on.","You are like light for the whole world. A city built on top of a hill cannot be hidden

 where it can give light to everyone in the house. ","Make your light shine
 so that others will see the good that you do and will praise your Father in heaven.","Don\u2019t suppose that I came to do away with the Law and the Prophets. I did not come to do away with them

 Jesus spoke to the crowds about John: What sort of person did you go out into the desert to see? Was he like tall grass blown about by the wind? ","What kind of man did you go out to see? Was he someone dressed in fine clothes? People who dress like that live in the king\u2019s palace.","What did you really go out to see? Was he a prophet? He certainly was. I tell you that he was more than a prophet.","In the Scriptures God says about him
 \u201cI am sending my messenger ahead of you to get things ready for you.\u201d ","I tell you that no one ever born on this earth is greater than John the Baptist. But whoever is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than John.","From the time of John the Baptist until now
 violent people have been trying to take over the kingdom of heaven by force. ","All the Books of the Prophets and the Law of Moses told what was going to happen up to the time of John.","And if you believe them
 John is Elijah

 pay attention!","You people are like children sitting in the market and shouting to each other
","\u201cWe played the flute
 but you would not dance! We sang a funeral song
 but you would not mourn!\u201d","John the Baptist did not go around eating and drinking
 and you said
 \u201cThat man has a demon in him!\u201d ","But the Son of Man goes around eating and drinking
 and you say
 \u201cThat man eats and drinks too much! He is even a friend of tax collectors and sinners.\u201d Yet Wisdom is shown to be right by what it does.","In the towns where Jesus had worked most of his miracles
 the people refused to turn to God. So Jesus was upset with them and said:","You people of Chorazin are in for trouble! You people of Bethsaida are in for trouble too! If the miracles that took place in your towns had happened in Tyre and Sidon
 the people there would have turned to God long ago. They would have dressed in sackcloth and put ashes on their heads. ","I tell you that on the day of judgment the people of Tyre and Sidon will get off easier than you will.","People of Capernaum
 do you think you will be honored in heaven? You will go down to hell! If the miracles that took place in your town had happened in Sodom
 that town would still be standing. ","So I tell you that on the day of judgment the people of Sodom will get off easier than you.","At that moment Jesus said: My Father
 Lord of heaven and earth
 I am grateful that you hid all this from wise and educated people and showed it to ordinary people. ","Yes
 Father
 that is what pleased you.","My Father has given me everything
 and he is the only one who knows the Son. The only one who truly knows the Father is the Son. But the Son wants to tell others about the Father
 so that they can know him too.","If you are tired from carrying heavy burdens
 come to me and I will give you rest. ","Take the yoke I give you. Put it on your shoulders and learn from me. I am gentle and humble
 and you will find rest. ","This yoke is easy to bear
 and this burden is light.","Jesus answered: You surely must have read what David did when he and his followers were hungry.","He went into the house of God
 and then they ate the sacred loaves of bread that only priests are supposed to eat. ","Haven\u2019t you read in the Law of Moses that the priests are allowed to work in the temple on the Sabbath? But no one says that they are guilty of breaking the law of the Sabbath.","I tell you that there is something here greater than the temple.","Don\u2019t you know what the Scriptures mean when they say
 \u201cInstead of offering sacrifices to me
 I want you to be merciful to others?\u201d If you knew what this means
 you would not condemn these innocent disciples of mine. ","So the Son of Man is Lord over the Sabbath.","Jesus answered
 \u201cIf you had a sheep that fell into a ditch on the Sabbath
 wouldn\u2019t you lift it out? ","People are worth much more than sheep
 and so it is right to do good on the Sabbath.\u201d ","Then Jesus told the man
 \u201cHold out your hand.\u201d The man did
 and it became as healthy as the other one.","Jesus knew what they were thinking
 and he said to them: Any kingdom where people fight each other will end up ruined. And a town or family that fights will soon destroy itself. ","So if Satan fights against himself
 how can his kingdom last? ","If I use the power of Beelzebul to force out demons
 whose power do your own followers use to force them out? Your followers are the ones who will judge you. ","But when I force out demons by the power of God\u2019s Spirit
 it proves that God\u2019s kingdom has already come to you. ","How can anyone break into a strong man\u2019s house and steal his things
 unless he first ties up the strong man? Then he can take everything.","If you are not on my side
 you are against me. If you don\u2019t gather in the harvest with me
 you scatter it. ","I tell you that any sinful thing you do or say can be forgiven. Even if you speak against the Son of Man
 you can be forgiven. But if you speak against the Holy Spirit
 you can never be forgiven
 either in this life or in the life to come.","A good tree produces only good fruit
 and a bad tree produces bad fruit. You can tell what a tree is like by the fruit it produces. ","You are a bunch of evil snakes
 so how can you say anything good? Your words show what is in your hearts. ","Good people bring good things out of their hearts
 but evil people bring evil things out of their hearts. ","I promise you that on the day of judgment
 everyone will have to account for every careless word they have spoken. ","On that day they will be told that they are either innocent or guilty because of the things they have said.","But Jesus replied: You want a sign because you are evil and won\u2019t believe! But the only sign you will get is the sign of the prophet Jonah.","He was in the stomach of a big fish for three days and nights
 just as the Son of Man will be deep in the earth for three days and nights. ","On the day of judgment the people of Nineveh will stand there with you and condemn you. They turned to God when Jonah preached
 and yet here is something far greater than Jonah. ","The Queen of the South will also stand there with you and condemn you. She traveled a long way to hear Solomon\u2019s wisdom
 and yet here is something much greater than Solomon.","When an evil spirit leaves a person
 it travels through the desert
 looking for a place to rest. But when the demon doesn\u2019t find a place
 ","it says
 \u201cI will go back to the home I left.\u201d When it gets there and finds the place empty
 clean
 and fixed up
 ","it goes off and finds seven other evil spirits even worse than itself. They all come and make their home there
 and the person ends up in worse shape than before. That\u2019s how it will be with you evil people of today.","While Jesus was still speaking to the crowds
 his mother and brothers came and stood outside because they wanted to talk with him. ","Jesus answered
 \u201cWho is my mother and who are my brothers?\u201d ","Then he pointed to his disciples and said
 \u201cThese are my mother and my brothers! ","Anyone who obeys my Father in heaven is my brother or sister or mother.\u201d","Then he taught them many things by using stories. He said: A farmer went out to scatter seed in a field.","While the farmer was scattering the seed
 some of it fell along the road and was eaten by birds. ","Other seeds fell on thin
 rocky ground and quickly started growing because the soil wasn\u2019t very deep. ","But when the sun came up
 the plants were scorched and dried up
 because they did not have enough roots. ","Some other seeds fell where thornbushes grew up and choked the plants.","But a few seeds did fall on good ground where the plants produced a hundred or sixty or thirty times as much as was scattered.","If you have ears
 pay attention!","Jesus answered: I have explained the secrets about the kingdom of heaven to you
 but not to others. ","Everyone who has something will be given more. But people who don\u2019t have anything will lose even what little they have.","I use stories when I speak to them because when they look
 they cannot see
 and when they listen
 they cannot hear or understand. ","So God\u2019s promise came true
 just as the prophet Isaiah had said
 \u201cThese people will listen and listen
 but never understand. They will look and look
 but never see.","All of them have stubborn minds! Their ears are stopped up
 and their eyes are covered. They cannot see or hear or understand. If they could
 they would turn to me
 and I would heal them.\u201d","But God has blessed you
 because your eyes can see and your ears can hear! ","Many prophets and good people were eager to see what you see and to hear what you hear. But I tell you that they did not see or hear.","Now listen to the meaning of the story about the farmer:","The seeds that fell along the road are the people who hear the message about the kingdom
 but don\u2019t understand it. Then the evil one comes and snatches the message from their hearts. ","The seeds that fell on rocky ground are the people who gladly hear the message and accept it right away.","But they don\u2019t have deep roots
 and they don\u2019t last very long. As soon as life gets hard or the message gets them in trouble
 they give up.","The seeds that fell among the thornbushes are also people who hear the message. But they start worrying about the needs of this life and are fooled by the desire to get rich. So the message gets choked out
 and they never produce anything. ","The seeds that fell on good ground are the people who hear and understand the message. They produce as much as a hundred or sixty or thirty times what was planted.","Jesus then told them this story: The kingdom of heaven is like what happened when a farmer scattered good seed in a field.","But while everyone was sleeping
 an enemy came and scattered weed seeds in the field and then left.","When the plants came up and began to ripen
 the farmer\u2019s servants could see the weeds. ","The servants came and asked
 \u201cSir
 didn\u2019t you scatter good seed in your field? Where did these weeds come from?\u201d","\u201cAn enemy did this
\u201d he replied. His servants then asked
 \u201cDo you want us to go out and pull up the weeds?\u201d","\u201cNo!\u201d he answered. \u201cYou might also pull up the wheat.","Leave the weeds alone until harvest time. Then I\u2019ll tell my workers to gather the weeds and tie them up and burn them. But I\u2019ll have them store the wheat in my barn.\u201d","Jesus told them another story: The kingdom of heaven is like what happens when a farmer plants a mustard seed in a field.","Although it is the smallest of all seeds
 it grows larger than any garden plant and becomes a tree. Birds even come and nest on its branches.","Jesus also said: The kingdom of heaven is like what happens when a woman mixes a little yeast into three big batches of flour. Finally
 all the dough rises.","Jesus answered: The one who scattered the good seed is the Son of Man.","The field is the world
 and the good seeds are the people who belong to the kingdom. The weed seeds are those who belong to the evil one
 ","and the one who scattered them is the devil. The harvest is the end of time
 and angels are the ones who bring in the harvest.","Weeds are gathered and burned. That\u2019s how it will be at the end of time.","The Son of Man will send out his angels
 and they will gather from his kingdom everyone who does wrong or causes others to sin. ","Then he will throw them into a flaming furnace
 where people will cry and grit their teeth in pain. ","But everyone who has done right will shine like the sun in their Father\u2019s kingdom. If you have ears
 pay attention!","The kingdom of heaven is like what happens when someone finds a treasure hidden in a field and buries it again. A person like that is happy and goes and sells everything in order to buy that field.","The kingdom of heaven is like what happens when a shop owner is looking for fine pearls.","After finding a very valuable one
 the owner goes and sells everything in order to buy that pearl.","The kingdom of heaven is like what happens when a net is thrown into a lake and catches all kinds of fish.","When the net is full
 it is dragged to the shore
 and the fishermen sit down to separate the fish. They keep the good ones
 but throw the bad ones away. ","That\u2019s how it will be at the end of time. Angels will come and separate the evil people from the ones who have done right.","Then those evil people will be thrown into a flaming furnace
 where they will cry and grit their teeth in pain.","Jesus asked his disciples if they understood all these things. They said
 \u201cYes
 we do.\u201d","So he told them
 \u201cEvery student of the Scriptures who becomes a disciple in the kingdom of heaven is like someone who brings out new and old treasures from the storeroom.\u201d","So the people were very unhappy because of what he was doing. But Jesus said
 \u201cProphets are honored by everyone

 \u201cThey don\u2019t have to leave. Why don\u2019t you give them something to eat?\u201d","Jesus asked his disciples to bring the food to him
 ","At once
 Jesus said to them
 \u201cDon\u2019t worry! I am Jesus. Don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d","\u201cCome on!\u201d Jesus said. Peter then got out of the boat and started walking on the water toward him.","Right away
 Jesus reached out his hand. He helped Peter up and said
 \u201cYou surely don\u2019t have much faith. Why do you doubt?\u201d","Jesus answered: Why do you disobey God and follow your own teaching?","Didn\u2019t God command you to respect your father and mother?

 \u201cBut who do you say I am?\u201d","Jesus told him: Simon
 son of Jonah
 you are blessed! You didn\u2019t discover this on your own. It was shown to you by my Father in heaven. ","So I will call you Peter
 which means \u201ca rock.\u201d On this rock I will build my church
 and death itself will not have any power over it. ","I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven
 and God in heaven will allow whatever you allow on earth. But he will not allow anything that you don\u2019t allow.","Jesus turned to Peter and said
 \u201cSatan
 get away from me! You\u2019re in my way because you think like everyone else and not like God.\u201d","Then Jesus said to his disciples: If any of you want to be my followers
 you must forget about yourself. You must take up your cross and follow me. ","If you want to save your life
 you will destroy it. But if you give up your life for me
 you will find it. ","What will you gain
 if you own the whole world but destroy yourself? What would you give to get back your soul?","The Son of Man will soon come in the glory of his Father and with his angels to reward all people for what they have done.","I promise you that some of those standing here will not die before they see the Son of Man coming with his kingdom.","But Jesus came over and touched them. He said
 \u201cGet up and don\u2019t be afraid!\u201d ","On their way down from the mountain
 Jesus warned his disciples not to tell anyone what they had seen until after the Son of Man had been raised from death.","Jesus told them
 \u201cElijah certainly will come and get everything ready. ","In fact
 he has already come. But the people did not recognize him and treated him just as they wanted to. They will soon make the Son of Man suffer in the same way.\u201d ","Jesus said
 \u201cYou people are too stubborn to have any faith! How much longer must I be with you? Why do I have to put up with you? Bring the boy here.\u201d ","Jesus replied: It is because you don\u2019t have enough faith! But I can promise you this. If you had faith no larger than a mustard seed
 you could tell this mountain to move from here to there. And it would. Everything would be possible for you.","While Jesus and his disciples were going from place to place in Galilee
 he told them
 \u201cThe Son of Man will be handed over to people ","who will kill him. But three days later he will rise to life.\u201d All of this made the disciples very sad.","\u201cYes
 he does
\u201d Peter answered. After they had returned home
 Jesus went up to Peter and asked him
 \u201cSimon
 what do you think? Do the kings of this earth collect taxes and fees from their own people or from foreigners?\u201d","Peter answered
 \u201cFrom foreigners.\u201d Jesus replied
 \u201cThen their own people don\u2019t have to pay. ","But we don\u2019t want to cause trouble. So go cast a line into the lake and pull out the first fish you hook. Open its mouth
 and you will find a coin. Use it to pay your taxes and mine.\u201d","Then he said: I promise you this. If you don\u2019t change and become like a child
 you will never get into the kingdom of heaven. ","But if you are as humble as this child
 you are the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. ","And when you welcome one of these children because of me
 you welcome me.","It will be terrible for people who cause even one of my little followers to sin. Those people would be better off thrown into the deepest part of the ocean with a heavy stone tied around their necks!","The world is in for trouble because of the way it causes people to sin. There will always be something to cause people to sin
 but anyone who does this will be in for trouble.","If your hand or foot causes you to sin
 chop it off and throw it away! You would be better off to go into life crippled or lame than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into the fire that never goes out. ","If your eye causes you to sin
 poke it out and get rid of it. You would be better off to go into life with only one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fires of hell.","Don\u2019t be cruel to any of these little ones! I promise you that their angels are always with my Father in heaven.","Let me ask you this. What would you do if you had a hundred sheep and one of them wandered off? Wouldn\u2019t you leave the ninety-nine on the hillside and go look for the one that had wandered away?","I am sure that finding it would make you happier than having the ninety-nine that never wandered off.","That\u2019s how it is with your Father in heaven. He doesn\u2019t want any of these little ones to be lost.","If one of my followers sins against you
 go and point out what was wrong. But do it in private
 just between the two of you. If that person listens
 you have won back a follower. ","But if that one refuses to listen
 take along one or two others. The Scriptures teach that every complaint must be proven true by two or more witnesses. ","If the follower refuses to listen to them
 report the matter to the church. Anyone who refuses to listen to the church must be treated like an unbeliever or a tax collector.","I promise you that God in heaven will allow whatever you allow on earth
 but he will not allow anything you don\u2019t allow. ","I promise that when any two of you on earth agree about something you are praying for
 my Father in heaven will do it for you. ","Whenever two or three of you come together in my name
 I am there with you.","Jesus answered: Not just seven times
 but seventy-seven times! ","This story will show you what the kingdom of heaven is like: One day a king decided to call in his officials and ask them to give an account of what they owed him.","As he was doing this
 one official was brought in who owed him fifty million silver coins. ","But he didn\u2019t have any money to pay what he owed. The king ordered him to be sold
 along with his wife and children and all he owned
 in order to pay the debt.","The official got down on his knees and began begging
 \u201cHave pity on me
 and I will pay you every cent I owe!\u201d ","The king felt sorry for him and let him go free. He even told the official that he did not have to pay back the money.","As the official was leaving
 he happened to meet another official
 who owed him a hundred silver coins. So he grabbed the man by the throat. He started choking him and said
 \u201cPay me what you owe!\u201d","The man got down on his knees and began begging
 \u201cHave pity on me
 and I will pay you back.\u201d ","But the first official refused to have pity. Instead
 he went and had the other official put in jail until he could pay what he owed.","When some other officials found out what had happened
 they felt sorry for the man who had been put in jail. Then they told the king what had happened. ","The king called the first official back in and said
 \u201cYou\u2019re an evil man! When you begged for mercy
 I said you did not have to pay back a cent. ","Don\u2019t you think you should show pity to someone else
 as I did to you?\u201d ","The king was so angry that he ordered the official to be tortured until he could pay back everything he owed.","That is how my Father in heaven will treat you
 if you don\u2019t forgive each of my followers with all your heart.","Jesus answered
 \u201cDon\u2019t you know that in the beginning the Creator made a man and a woman? ","That\u2019s why a man leaves his father and mother and gets married. He becomes like one person with his wife.","Then they are no longer two people
 but one. And no one should separate a couple that God has joined together.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cYou are so heartless! That\u2019s why Moses allowed you to divorce your wife. But from the beginning God did not intend it to be that way. ","I say that if your wife has not committed some terrible sexual sin
 you must not divorce her to marry someone else. If you do
 you are unfaithful.\u201d","Jesus told them
 \u201cOnly those people who have been given the gift of staying single can accept this teaching. ","Some people are unable to marry because of birth defects or because of what someone has done to their bodies. Others stay single for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Anyone who can accept this teaching should do so.\u201d","But Jesus said
 \u201cLet the children come to me
 and don\u2019t try to stop them! People who are like these children belong to God\u2019s kingdom.\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cWhy do you ask me about what is good? Only God is good. If you want to have eternal life
 you must obey his commandments.\u201d","\u201cWhich ones?\u201d the man asked. Jesus answered
 \u201cDo not murder. Be faithful in marriage. Do not steal. Do not tell lies about others. ","Respect your father and mother. And love others as much as you love yourself.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cIf you want to be perfect
 go sell everything you own! Give the money to the poor
 and you will have riches in heaven. Then come and be my follower.\u201d ","Jesus said to his disciples
 \u201cIt\u2019s terribly hard for rich people to get into the kingdom of heaven! ","In fact
 it\u2019s easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to get into God\u2019s kingdom.\u201d","Jesus looked straight at them and said
 \u201cThere are some things that people cannot do
 but God can do anything.\u201d","Jesus answered: Yes
 all of you have become my followers. And so in the future world
 when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne
 I promise that you will sit on twelve thrones to judge the twelve tribes of Israel. ","All who have given up home or brothers and sisters or father and mother or children or land for me will be given a hundred times as much. They will also have eternal life.","But many who are now first will be last
 and many who are last will be first.","As Jesus was telling what the kingdom of heaven would be like
 he said: Early one morning a man went out to hire some workers for his vineyard. ","After he had agreed to pay them the usual amount for a day\u2019s work
 he sent them off to his vineyard.","About nine that morning
 the man saw some other people standing in the market with nothing to do. ","He said he would pay them what was fair
 if they would work in his vineyard. ","So they went. At noon and again about three in the afternoon he returned to the market. And each time he made the same agreement with others who were loafing around with nothing to do.","Finally
 about five in the afternoon the man went back and found some others standing there. He asked them
 \u201cWhy have you been standing here all day long doing nothing?\u201d","\u201cBecause no one has hired us
\u201d they answered. Then he told them to go work in his vineyard.","That evening the owner of the vineyard told the man in charge of the workers to call them in and give them their money. He also told the man to begin with the ones who were hired last.","When the workers arrived
 the ones who had been hired at five in the afternoon were given a full day\u2019s pay.","The workers who had been hired first thought they would be given more than the others. But when they were given the same
 ","they began complaining to the owner of the vineyard.","They said
 \u201cThe ones who were hired last worked for only one hour. But you paid them the same that you did us. And we worked in the hot sun all day long!\u201d","The owner answered one of them
 \u201cFriend
 I didn\u2019t cheat you. I paid you exactly what we agreed on. ","Take your money now and go! What business is it of yours if I want to pay them the same that I paid you?","Don\u2019t I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Why should you be jealous
 if I want to be generous?\u201d","Jesus then said
 \u201cSo it is. Everyone who is now first will be last
 and everyone who is last will be first.\u201d","We are now on our way to Jerusalem
 where the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the teachers of the Law of Moses. They will sentence him to death
 ","and then they will hand him over to foreigners who will make fun of him. They will beat him and nail him to a cross. But on the third day he will rise from death.","Jesus asked her what she wanted
 and she said
 \u201cWhen you come into your kingdom
 please let one of my sons sit at your right side and the other at your left.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cNot one of you knows what you are asking. Are you able to drink from the cup that I must soon drink from?\u201d James and John said
 \u201cYes
 we are!\u201d","But Jesus called the disciples together and said: You know that foreign rulers like to order their people around. And their great leaders have full power over everyone they rule.","But don\u2019t act like them. If you want to be great
 you must be the servant of all the others. ","And if you want to be first
 you must be the slave of the rest. ","The Son of Man did not come to be a slave master
 but a slave who will give his life to rescue many people.","When Jesus heard them
 he stopped and asked
 \u201cWhat do you want me to do for you?\u201d","He told them
 \u201cGo into the next village
 where you will at once find a donkey and her colt. Untie the two donkeys and bring them to me. ","If anyone asks why you are doing that
 just say
 \u2018The Lord needs them.\u2019 Right away he will let you have the donkeys.\u201d","He told them
 \u201cThe Scriptures say
 \u2018My house should be called a place of worship.\u2019 But you have turned it into a place where robbers hide.\u201d","The men said to Jesus
 \u201cDon\u2019t you hear what those children are saying?\u201d \u201cYes
 I do!\u201d Jesus answered. \u201cDon\u2019t you know that the Scriptures say
 \u2018Children and infants will sing praises\u2019?\u201d ","and along the way he saw a fig tree. But when he came to it
 he found only leaves and no figs. So he told the tree
 \u201cYou will never again grow any fruit!\u201d Right then the fig tree dried up.","But Jesus said to them
 \u201cIf you have faith and don\u2019t doubt
 I promise that you can do what I did to this tree. And you will be able to do even more. You can tell this mountain to get up and jump into the sea
 and it will. ","If you have faith when you pray
 you will be given whatever you ask for.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cI have just one question to ask you. If you answer it
 I will tell you where I got the right to do these things. ","Who gave John the right to baptize? Was it God in heaven or merely some human being?\u201d They thought it over and said to each other
 \u201cWe can\u2019t say that God gave John this right. Jesus will ask us why we didn\u2019t believe John. ","So they told Jesus
 \u201cWe don\u2019t know.\u201d Jesus said
 \u201cThen I won\u2019t tell you who gave me the right to do what I do.\u201d","Jesus said: I will tell you a story about a man who had two sons. Then you can tell me what you think. The father went to the older son and said
 \u201cGo work in the vineyard today!\u201d ","His son told him that he would not do it
 but later he changed his mind and went. ","The man then told his younger son to go work in the vineyard. The boy said he would
 but he didn\u2019t go. ","Which one of the sons obeyed his father? \u201cThe older one
\u201d the chief priests and leaders answered. Then Jesus told them: You can be sure that tax collectors and prostitutes will get into the kingdom of God before you ever will! ","When John the Baptist showed you how to do right
 you would not believe him. But these evil people did believe. And even when you saw what they did
 you still would not change your minds and believe.","Jesus told the chief priests and leaders to listen to this story: A land owner once planted a vineyard. He built a wall around it and dug a pit to crush the grapes in. He also built a lookout tower. Then he rented out his vineyard and left the country.","When it was harvest time
 the owner sent some servants to get his share of the grapes. ","But the renters grabbed those servants. They beat up one
 killed one
 and stoned one of them to death. ","He then sent more servants than he did the first time. But the renters treated them in the same way.","Finally
 the owner sent his own son to the renters
 because he thought they would respect him. ","But when they saw the man\u2019s son
 they said
 \u201cSomeday he will own the vineyard. Let\u2019s kill him! Then we can have it all for ourselves.\u201d ","So they grabbed him
 threw him out of the vineyard
 and killed him.","Jesus asked
 \u201cWhen the owner of that vineyard comes
 what do you suppose he will do to those renters?\u201d","The chief priests and leaders answered
 \u201cHe will kill them in some horrible way. Then he will rent out his vineyard to people who will give him his share of grapes at harvest time.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cYou surely know that the Scriptures say
 \u2018The stone that the builders tossed aside is now the most important stone of all. This is something the Lord has done
 and it is amazing to us.\u2019","I tell you that God\u2019s kingdom will be taken from you and given to people who will do what he demands.","Anyone who stumbles over this stone will be crushed
 and anyone it falls on will be smashed to pieces.\u201d","The kingdom of heaven is like what happened when a king gave a wedding banquet for his son.","The king sent some servants to tell the invited guests to come to the banquet
 but the guests refused. ","He sent other servants to say to the guests
 \u201cThe banquet is ready! My cattle and prize calves have all been prepared. Everything is ready. Come to the banquet!\u201d","But the guests did not pay any attention. Some of them left for their farms
 and some went to their places of business. ","Others grabbed the servants
 then beat them up and killed them.","This made the king so furious that he sent an army to kill those murderers and burn down their city.","Then he said to the servants
 \u201cIt is time for the wedding banquet
 and the invited guests don\u2019t deserve to come. ","Go out to the street corners and tell everyone you meet to come to the banquet.\u201d","They went out on the streets and brought in everyone they could find
 good and bad alike. And the banquet room was filled with guests.","When the king went in to meet the guests
 he found that one of them wasn\u2019t wearing the right kind of clothes for the wedding. ","The king asked
 \u201cFriend
 why didn\u2019t you wear proper clothes for the wedding?\u201d But the guest had no excuse. ","So the king gave orders for that person to be tied hand and foot and to be thrown outside into the dark. That\u2019s where people will cry and grit their teeth in pain.","Many are invited
 but only a few are chosen.","Jesus knew their evil thoughts and said
 \u201cWhy are you trying to test me? You show-offs! ","Let me see one of the coins used for paying taxes.\u201d They brought him a silver coin
 ","and he asked
 \u201cWhose picture and name are on it?\u201d","\u201cThe Emperor\u2019s
\u201d they answered. Then Jesus told them
 \u201cGive the Emperor what belongs to him and give God what belongs to God.\u201d ","Jesus answered: You are completely wrong! You don\u2019t know what the Scriptures teach. And you don\u2019t know anything about the power of God.","When God raises people to life
 they won\u2019t marry. They will be like the angels in heaven. ","And as for people being raised to life
 God was speaking to you when he said
 ","\u201cI am the God worshiped by Abraham
 Isaac
 and Jacob.\u201d He isn\u2019t the God of the dead
 but of the living.","Jesus answered: Love the Lord your God with all your heart
 soul
 and mind. ","This is the first and most important commandment.","The second most important commandment is like this one. And it is
 \u201cLove others as much as you love yourself.\u201d ","All the Law of Moses and the Books of the Prophets are based on these two commandments.","\u201cWhat do you think about the Messiah? Whose family will he come from?\u201d They answered
 \u201cHe will be a son of King David.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cHow then could the Spirit lead David to call the Messiah his Lord? David said
","\u2019The Lord said to my Lord: Sit at my right side until I make your enemies into a footstool for you.\u2019","If David called the Messiah his Lord
 how can the Messiah be a son of King David?\u201d ","The Pharisees and the teachers of the Law are experts in the Law of Moses.","So obey everything they teach you

 they say one thing and do something else.","They pile heavy burdens on people\u2019s shoulders and won\u2019t lift a finger to help.","Everything they do is just to show off in front of others. They even make a big show of wearing Scripture verses on their foreheads and arms
 and they wear big tassels for everyone to see. ","They love the best seats at banquets and the front seats in the meeting places.","And when they are in the market
 they like to have people greet them as their teachers.","But none of you should be called a teacher. You have only one teacher
 and all of you are like brothers and sisters. ","Don\u2019t call anyone on earth your father. All of you have the same Father in heaven.","None of you should be called the leader. The Messiah is your only leader.","Whoever is the greatest should be the servant of the others.","If you put yourself above others
 you will be put down. But if you humble yourself
 you will be honored.","You Pharisees and teachers of the Law of Moses are in for trouble! You\u2019re nothing but show-offs. You lock people out of the kingdom of heaven. You won\u2019t go in yourselves

 the gold or the temple that makes the gold sacred?","You also teach that it doesn\u2019t matter if a person swears by the altar. But you say that it does matter if someone swears by the gift on the altar.","Are you blind? Which is more important

Who are the ones the master will put in charge of giving the other servants their food supplies at the proper time?","Servants are fortunate if their master comes and finds them doing their job.","You may be sure that a servant who is always faithful will be put in charge of everything the master owns.","But suppose one of the servants thinks that the master won\u2019t return until late.","Suppose that evil servant starts beating the other servants and eats and drinks with people who are drunk.","If that happens
 the master will surely come on a day and at a time when the servant least expects him. ","That servant will then be punished and thrown out with the ones who only pretended to serve their master. There they will cry and grit their teeth in pain.","The kingdom of heaven is like what happened one night when ten girls took their oil lamps and went to a wedding to meet the groom.","Five of the girls were foolish and five were wise.","The foolish ones took their lamps
 but no extra oil. ","The ones who were wise took along extra oil for their lamps.","The groom was late arriving
 and the girls became drowsy and fell asleep. ","Then in the middle of the night someone shouted
 \u201cHere\u2019s the groom! Come to meet him!\u201d","When the girls got up and started getting their lamps ready
 ","the foolish ones said to the others
 \u201cLet us have some of your oil! Our lamps are going out.\u201d","The girls who were wise answered
 \u201cThere\u2019s not enough oil for all of us! Go and buy some for yourselves.\u201d","While the foolish girls were on their way to get some oil
 the groom arrived. The girls who were ready went into the wedding
 and the doors were closed. ","Later the other girls returned and shouted
 \u201cSir
 sir! Open the door for us!\u201d","But the groom replied
 \u201cI don\u2019t even know you!\u201d","So
 my disciples
 always be ready! You don\u2019t know the day or the time when all this will happen.","The kingdom is also like what happened when a man went away and put his three servants in charge of all he owned.","The man knew what each servant could do. So he handed five thousand coins to the first servant
 two thousand to the second
 and one thousand to the third. Then he left the country.","As soon as the man had gone
 the servant with the five thousand coins used them to earn five thousand more. ","The servant who had two thousand coins did the same with his money and earned two thousand more.","But the servant with one thousand coins dug a hole and hid his master\u2019s money in the ground.","Some time later the master of those servants returned. He called them in and asked what they had done with his money.","The servant who had been given five thousand coins brought them in with the five thousand that he had earned. He said
 \u201cSir

 and I have earned five thousand more.\u201d","\u201cWonderful!\u201d his master replied. \u201cYou are a good and faithful servant. I left you in charge of only a little
 but now I will put you in charge of much more. Come and share in my happiness!\u201d","Next
 the servant who had been given two thousand coins came in and said
 \u201cSir

 \u201cSir

 \u201cYou are lazy and good-for-nothing! You know that I harvest what I don\u2019t plant and gather crops where I haven\u2019t scattered seed. ","You could have at least put my money in the bank
 so that I could have earned interest on it.\u201d","Then the master said
 \u201cNow your money will be taken away and given to the servant with ten thousand coins! ","Everyone who has something will be given more
 and they will have more than enough. But everything will be taken from those who don\u2019t have anything. ","You are a worthless servant
 and you will be thrown out into the dark where people will cry and grit their teeth in pain.\u201d","When the Son of Man comes in his glory with all of his angels
 he will sit on his royal throne. ","The people of all nations will be brought before him
 and he will separate them
 as shepherds separate their sheep from their goats.","He will place the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.","Then the king will say to those on his right
 \u201cMy father has blessed you! Come and receive the kingdom that was prepared for you before the world was created. ","When I was hungry
 you gave me something to eat

 and when I was in jail
 you visited me.\u201d","Then the ones who pleased the Lord will ask
 \u201cWhen did we give you something to eat or drink? ","When did we welcome you as a stranger or give you clothes to wear","or visit you while you were sick or in jail?\u201d","The king will answer
 \u201cWhenever you did it for any of my people

 you did it for me.\u201d","Then the king will say to those on his left
 \u201cGet away from me! You are under God\u2019s curse. Go into the everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels! ","I was hungry
 but you did not give me anything to eat
 and I was thirsty

 \u201cOne of you men who has eaten with me from this dish will betray me. ","The Son of Man will die
 as the Scriptures say. But it\u2019s going to be terrible for the one who betrays me! That man would be better off if he had never been born.\u201d","Judas said
 \u201cTeacher
 you surely don\u2019t mean me!\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what you say!\u201d Jesus replied. But later
 Judas did betray him.","During the meal Jesus took some bread in his hands. He blessed the bread and broke it. Then he gave it to his disciples and said
 \u201cTake this and eat it. This is my body.\u201d","Jesus picked up a cup of wine and gave thanks to God. He then gave it to his disciples and said
 \u201cTake this and drink it. ","This is my blood

 so that many people will have their sins forgiven. ","From now on I am not going to drink any wine
 until I drink new wine with you in my Father\u2019s kingdom.\u201d ","Jesus said to his disciples
 \u201cDuring this very night
 all of you will reject me

 I will go to Galilee ahead of you.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cI promise you that before a rooster crows tonight
 you will say three times that you don\u2019t know me.\u201d ","Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane. When they got there
 he told them
 \u201cSit here while I go over there and pray.\u201d","and he said to them
 \u201cI am so sad that I feel as if I am dying. Stay here and keep awake with me.\u201d","Jesus walked on a little way. Then he knelt with his face to the ground and prayed
 \u201cMy Father
 if it is possible
 don\u2019t make me suffer by having me drink from this cup. But do what you want

 \u201cMy Father

 Jesus returned to his disciples and said
 \u201cAre you still sleeping and resting? The time has come for the Son of Man to be handed over to sinners. ","Get up! Let\u2019s go. The one who will betray me is already here.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cMy friend
 why are you here?\u201d The men grabbed Jesus and arrested him. ","But Jesus told him
 \u201cPut your sword away. Anyone who lives by fighting will die by fighting. ","Don\u2019t you know that I could ask my Father

 how could the words of the Scriptures come true

 \u201cWhy do you come with swords and clubs to arrest me like a criminal? Day after day I sat and taught in the temple
 and you didn\u2019t arrest me. ","But all this happened
 so that what the prophets wrote would come true.\u201d All of Jesus' disciples left him and ran away.","\u201cThat is what you say!\u201d Jesus answered. \u201cBut I tell all of you
 \u2018Soon you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right side of God All-Powerful and coming on the clouds of heaven.\u2019\u201d","and Peter remembered that Jesus had said
 \u201cBefore a rooster crows
 you will say three times that you don\u2019t know me.\u201d Then Peter went out and cried hard.","Jesus was brought before Pilate the governor

 \u201cAre you the king of the Jews?\u201d \u201cThose are your words!\u201d Jesus answered. ","Then about that time Jesus shouted

 \u201cMy God

 \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid! Tell my followers to go to Galilee. They will see me there.\u201d","Jesus came to them and said: I have been given all authority in heaven and on earth!","Go to the people of all nations and make them my disciples. Baptize them in the name of the Father

 there is no way to make it salty again. It has become worthless
 so it is thrown out and people trample on it.","\u201cYou are like light for the whole world. A city built on a hill cannot be hid.","No one lights a lamp and puts it under a bowl; instead it is put on the lampstand

 so that they will see the good things you do and praise your Father in heaven.","\u201cDo not think that I have come to do away with the Law of Moses and the teachings of the prophets. I have not come to do away with them

 not the least point nor the smallest detail of the Law will be done away with\u2014not until the end of all things. ","So then
 whoever disobeys even the least important of the commandments and teaches others to do the same
 will be least in the Kingdom of heaven. On the other hand
 whoever obeys the Law and teaches others to do the same
 will be great in the Kingdom of heaven. ","I tell you
 then
 that you will be able to enter the Kingdom of heaven only if you are more faithful than the teachers of the Law and the Pharisees in doing what God requires.","\u201cYou have heard that people were told in the past
 \u2018Do not commit murder; anyone who does will be brought to trial.\u2019 ","But now I tell you: if you are angry with your brother you will be brought to trial

 ","leave your gift there in front of the altar
 go at once and make peace with your brother
 and then come back and offer your gift to God.","\u201cIf someone brings a lawsuit against you and takes you to court
 settle the dispute while there is time

 I tell you
 until you pay the last penny of your fine.","\u201cYou have heard that it was said
 \u2018Do not commit adultery.\u2019 ","But now I tell you: anyone who looks at a woman and wants to possess her is guilty of committing adultery with her in his heart.","So if your right eye causes you to sin
 take it out and throw it away! It is much better for you to lose a part of your body than to have your whole body thrown into hell. ","If your right hand causes you to sin

 \u2018Anyone who divorces his wife must give her a written notice of divorce.\u2019 ","But now I tell you: if a man divorces his wife for any cause other than her unfaithfulness

 \u2018Do not break your promise

 lend it to him.","\u201cYou have heard that it was said
 \u2018Love your friends

 do not make a big show of it

 go to your room
 close the door
 and pray to your Father
 who is unseen. And your Father

 will reward you.","\u201cWhen you pray
 do not use a lot of meaningless words
 as the pagans do
 who think that their gods will hear them because their prayers are long. ","Do not be like them. Your Father already knows what you need before you ask him.","This
 then
 is how you should pray: \n\u2018Our Father in heaven:\n    May your holy name be honored;","may your Kingdom come; may your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.","Give us today the food we need.","Forgive us the wrongs we have done
 as we forgive the wrongs that others have done to us.","Do not bring us to hard testing

 your Father in heaven will also forgive you. ","But if you do not forgive others
 then your Father will not forgive the wrongs you have done.","\u201cAnd when you fast
 do not put on a sad face as the hypocrites do. They neglect their appearance so that everyone will see that they are fasting. I assure you
 they have already been paid in full. ","When you go without food

 ","so that others cannot know that you are fasting\u2014only your Father
 who is unseen

 where moths and rust destroy
 and robbers break in and steal. ","Instead
 store up riches for yourselves in heaven
 where moths and rust cannot destroy
 and robbers cannot break in and steal. ","For your heart will always be where your riches are.","\u201cThe eyes are like a lamp for the body. If your eyes are sound
 your whole body will be full of light; ","but if your eyes are no good
 your body will be in darkness. So if the light in you is darkness
 how terribly dark it will be!","\u201cYou cannot be a slave of two masters; you will hate one and love the other; you will be loyal to one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.","\u201cThis is why I tell you: do not be worried about the food and drink you need in order to stay alive

 isn't life worth more than food? And isn't the body worth more than clothes? ","Look at the birds: they do not plant seeds
 gather a harvest and put it in barns; yet your Father in heaven takes care of them! Aren't you worth much more than birds? ","Can any of you live a bit longer by worrying about it?","\u201cAnd why worry about clothes? Look how the wild flowers grow: they do not work or make clothes for themselves.","But I tell you that not even King Solomon with all his wealth had clothes as beautiful as one of these flowers.","It is God who clothes the wild grass\u2014grass that is here today and gone tomorrow

Your Father in heaven knows that you need all these things.","Instead
 be concerned above everything else with the Kingdom of God and with what he requires of you
 and he will provide you with all these other things. ","So do not worry about tomorrow; it will have enough worries of its own. There is no need to add to the troubles each day brings.","\u201cDo not judge others
 so that God will not judge you
 ","for God will judge you in the same way you judge others
 and he will apply to you the same rules you apply to others. ","Why
 then
 do you look at the speck in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the log in your own eye? ","How dare you say to your brother

 will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask him!","\u201cDo for others what you want them to do for you: this is the meaning of the Law of Moses and of the teachings of the prophets.","\u201cGo in through the narrow gate
 because the gate to hell is wide and the road that leads to it is easy
 and there are many who travel it. ","But the gate to life is narrow and the way that leads to it is hard
 and there are few people who find it.","\u201cBe on your guard against false prophets; they come to you looking like sheep on the outside

 they thought they would get more; but they too were given a silver coin each. ","They took their money and started grumbling against the employer.","\u2018These men who were hired last worked only one hour

 because you have hidden these things from wise and intelligent people and have revealed them to infants. ","Yes
 Father
 because this is what was pleasing to you. ","All things have been entrusted to me by my Father. No one fully knows the Son except the Father
 and no one fully knows the Father except the Son and the person to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.","\u201cCome to me
 all of you who are weary and loaded down with burdens
 and I will give you rest. ","Place my yoke on you and learn from me
 because I am gentle and humble
 and you will find rest for your souls
 ","because my yoke is pleasant
 and my burden is light.\u201d","But he told them
 \u201cHaven\u2019t you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry? ","How is it that he went into the house of God and ate the Bread of the Presence
 which was not lawful for him and his companions to eat but was reserved for the priests? ","Or haven\u2019t you read in the Law that on every Sabbath the priests in the Temple violate the Sabbath and yet are innocent?","But I tell you
 something greater than the Temple is here! ","If you had known what \u2018I want mercy and not sacrifice\u2019 means
 you would not have condemned the innocent
 ","for the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.\u201d","But he asked them
 \u201cIs there a man among you who
 if he had one sheep and it fell into a ditch on the Sabbath
 wouldn\u2019t take hold of it and pull it out? ","How much more is a human being worth than a sheep! So it is lawful to do good on Sabbath days.\u201d","Then he told the man
 \u201cHold out your hand.\u201d He held it out and it became normal
 as healthy as his other hand. ","He knew what they were thinking and told them
 \u201cEvery kingdom divided against itself is destroyed
 and every city or household divided against itself will not stand. ","So if Satan drives out Satan
 he is divided against himself. How
 then
 can his kingdom stand? ","If I drive out demons by Beelzebul
 by whom do your own followers drive them out? That is why they will be your judges! ","But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God
 then the kingdom of God has come to you. ","How can someone go into a strong man\u2019s house and carry off his possessions without first tying up the strong man? Then he can ransack his house.","The person who isn\u2019t with me is against me
 and the person who isn\u2019t gathering with me is scattering. ","So I tell you
 every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven
 but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. ","Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven
 but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven
 either in this age or in the one to come.\u201d","\u201cEither make the tree good and its fruit good
 or make the tree rotten and its fruit rotten
 because a tree is known by its fruit. ","You children of serpents! How can you say anything good when you are evil? The mouth speaks about what overflows from the heart.","A good person brings good things out of a good treasure house
 and an evil person brings evil things out of an evil treasure house. ","I tell you
 on Judgment Day people will give an account for every thoughtless word they have uttered
 ","because by your words you will be acquitted
 and by your words you will be condemned.\u201d","But he replied to them
 \u201cAn evil and adulterous generation craves a sign. Yet no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah
 ","because just as Jonah was in the stomach of the sea creature for three days and three nights
 so the Son of Man will be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights. ","The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment and condemn the people living today
 because they repented at the preaching of Jonah. But look\u2014something greater than Jonah is here! ","The queen of the south will stand up and condemn the people living today
 because she came from so far away to hear the wisdom of Solomon. But look! Something greater than Solomon is here!\u201d","\u201cWhenever an unclean spirit goes out of a person
 it wanders through waterless places looking for a place to rest
 but finds none. ","Then it says
 \u2018I will go back to my home that I left.\u2019 When it arrives
 it finds it empty
 swept clean
 and put in order. ","Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more evil than itself
 and they go in and settle there. And so the final condition of that person becomes worse than the first. That\u2019s just what will happen to this evil generation!\u201d","While Jesus was still speaking to the crowds
 his mother and brothers stood outside
 wanting to speak to him. ","He asked the man who told him
 \u201cWho is my mother
 and who are my brothers?\u201d ","Then pointing with his hand at his disciples
 he said
 \u201cHere are my mother and my brothers
 ","because whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.\u201d","Then he began to tell them many things in parables. He said
 \u201cListen! A farmer went out to sow. ","As he was sowing
 some seeds fell along the path
 and birds came and ate them up. ","Other seeds fell on stony ground
 where they did not have a lot of soil. They sprouted at once because the soil wasn\u2019t deep. ","But when the sun came up
 they were scorched. Since they did not have any roots
 they dried up. ","Other seeds fell among thorn bushes
 and the thorn bushes grew higher and choked them out. ","But other seeds fell on good soil and produced a crop
 some 100
 some 60
 and some 30 times what was sown. ","Let the person who has ears listen!\u201d","He answered them
 \u201cYou have been given knowledge about the secrets of the kingdom from heaven
 but it hasn\u2019t been given to them
 ","because to anyone who has something
 more will be given
 and he will have more than enough. But from the one who doesn\u2019t have anything
 even what he has will be taken away from him. ","That\u2019s why I speak to them in parables
 because \u2018they look but don\u2019t see
 and they listen but don\u2019t hear or understand.\u2019","\u201cWith them the prophecy of Isaiah is being fulfilled
 which says: \u2018You will listen and listen but never understand. You will look and look but never comprehend
","for this people\u2019s heart has become dull
 and their ears are hard of hearing. They have shut their eyes so that they might not see with their eyes
 and hear with their ears
 and understand with their heart and turn
 and I would heal them.\u2019","\u201cHow blessed are your eyes because they see
 and your ears because they hear! ","I tell all of you with certainty
 many prophets and righteous people longed to see the things you see but did not see them
 and to hear the things you hear but did not hear them.\u201d","\u201cListen
 then
 to the parable about the farmer. ","When anyone hears the word about the kingdom yet doesn\u2019t understand it
 the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is what was sown along the path. ","As for what was sown on the stony ground
 this is the person who hears the word and accepts it joyfully at once
 ","but since he doesn\u2019t have any root in himself
 he lasts for only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes along because of the word
 he immediately falls away. ","As for what was sown among the thorn bushes
 this is the person who hears the word
 but the worries of life and the deceitful pleasures of wealth choke the word so that it can\u2019t produce a crop. ","But as for what was sown on good soil
 this is the person who hears the word
 understands it
 and produces a crop that yields 100
 60
 or 30 times what was sown.\u201d","He presented another parable to them: \u201cThe kingdom from heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field.","While people were sleeping
 his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and went away. ","When the crop came up and bore grain
 the weeds appeared
 too.","\u201cThe owner\u2019s servants came and asked him
 \u2018Master
 you sowed good seed in your field
 didn\u2019t you? Then where did these weeds come from?\u2019","\u201cHe told them
 \u2018An enemy did this!\u2019 \u201cThe servants asked him
 \u2018Do you want us to go and pull them out?\u2019","\u201cHe said
 \u2018No! If you pull out the weeds
 you might pull out the wheat with them. ","Let both grow together until the harvest
 and at harvest time I will tell the reapers
 \u201cGather the weeds first and tie them in bundles for burning
 but bring the wheat into my barn.\u201d\u2019\u201d","He presented another parable to them
 saying
 \u201cThe kingdom from heaven is like a mustard seed that a man took and planted in his field. ","Although it is the smallest of all seeds
 when it is fully grown it is larger than the garden plants and becomes a tree
 and the birds in the sky come and nest in its branches.\u201d","He told them another parable: \u201cThe kingdom from heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed with three measures of flour until all of it was leavened.\u201d","He answered
 \u201cThe person who sowed good seed is the Son of Man
 ","while the field is the world. The good seed are those who belong to the kingdom
 while the weeds are those who belong to the evil one. ","The enemy who sowed them is the Devil
 the harvest is the end of the age
 and the reapers are the angels. ","Just as weeds are gathered and burned with fire
 so it will be at end of the age. ","The Son of Man will send his angels
 and they will gather from his kingdom everything that causes others to sin and those who practice lawlessness ","and they will throw them into a blazing furnace. In that place there will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.","Then the righteous will shine like the sun in their Father\u2019s kingdom. Let the person who has ears listen!\u201d","\u201cThe kingdom from heaven is like treasure hidden in a field that a man found and hid. In his excitement he went and sold everything he had and bought that field.\u201d","\u201cAgain
 the kingdom from heaven is like a merchant searching for fine pearls. ","When he found a very valuable pearl
 he went and sold everything he had and bought it.\u201d","\u201cAgain
 the kingdom from heaven is like a large net thrown into the sea that gathered all kinds of fish. ","When it was full
 the fishermen hauled it ashore. Then they sat down
 sorted the good fish into containers
 and threw the bad ones away. ","That is how it will be at the end of the age. The angels will go out
 cull out the evil people from among the righteous ones
 ","and will throw them into a blazing furnace. In that place there will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.\u201d","\u201cDo you understand all these things?\u201d They told him
 \u201cYes.\u201d","Then he told them
 \u201cThat is why every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom from heaven is like the master of a household who brings both new and old things out of his treasure chest.\u201d","And they were offended by him. But Jesus told them
 \u201cA prophet is without honor only in his hometown and in his own home.\u201d ","But Jesus told them
 \u201cThey don\u2019t need to go away. You give them something to eat.\u201d","He said
 \u201cBring them to me.\u201d ","\u201cHave courage!\u201d Jesus immediately told them. \u201cIt\u2019s me. Stop being afraid!\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cCome on!\u201d So Peter got down out of the boat
 started walking on the water
 and came to Jesus.","At once Jesus reached out his hand
 caught him
 and asked him
 \u201cYou who have so little faith
 why did you doubt?\u201d ","But he answered them
 \u201cWhy do you also disregard the commandment of God because of your tradition? ","Because God said
 \u2018You are to honor your father and your mother
\u2019 and
 \u2018Whoever curses father or mother must certainly be put to death.\u2019 ","But you say
 \u2018Whoever tells his father or his mother
 \u201cWhatever support you might have received from me has been given to God
\u201d ","does not have to honor his father.\u2019 Because of your tradition
 then
 you have disregarded the authority of God\u2019s word. ","You hypocrites! How well did Isaiah prophesy of you when he said
","\u2018These people honor me with their lips
 but their hearts are far from me.","Their worship of me is empty
 because they teach human rules as doctrines.\u2019\u201d","Then calling out to the crowd
 he addressed them
 \u201cListen and understand! ","It is not what goes into the mouth that makes a person unclean. It is what comes out of the mouth that makes a person unclean.\u201d","He replied
 \u201cEvery plant that my heavenly Father did not plant will be pulled up by the roots. ","Leave them alone. They are blind guides of the blind. If one blind person leads another blind person
 both will fall into a ditch.\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cAre you still so ignorant? ","Don\u2019t you know that everything that goes into the mouth passes into the stomach and then is expelled as waste?","But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart
 and it is those things that make a person unclean. ","It is out of the heart that evil thoughts come
 as well as murder
 adultery
 sexual immorality
 stealing
 false testimony
 and slander. ","These are the things that make a person unclean. But eating with unwashed hands doesn\u2019t make a person unclean.\u201d","But he replied
 \u201cI was sent only to the lost sheep of the nation of Israel.\u201d","He replied
 \u201cIt\u2019s not right to take the children\u2019s bread and throw it to the puppies.\u201d","Then Jesus answered her
 \u201cLady
 your faith is great! What you want is granted.\u201d That very hour her daughter was healed.","Then Jesus called his disciples and said
 \u201cI have compassion for the crowd because they have already been with me for three days and have nothing to eat. I don\u2019t want to send them away without food
 or they may faint on the road.\u201d","Jesus asked them
 \u201cHow many loaves of bread do you have?\u201d They said
 \u201cSeven
 and a few small fish.\u201d","He replied to them
 \u201cYou say
 \u2018Red sky at night
 what a delight!","Red sky in the morning
 cloudy and storming.\u2019 You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky
 yet you can\u2019t interpret the signs of the times? ","An evil and adulterous generation craves a sign
 but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah.\u201d Then he left them and went away.","Jesus told them
 \u201cWatch out! Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees!\u201d","Knowing this
 Jesus asked them
 \u201cYou who have little faith
 why are you discussing among yourselves the fact that you don\u2019t have any bread? ","Don\u2019t you understand yet? Don\u2019t you remember the five loaves for the 5
000 and how many baskets you collected
 ","or the seven loaves for the 4
000 and how many baskets you collected? ","How can you fail to understand that I wasn\u2019t talking to you about bread? Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees!\u201d","When Jesus had come to the region of Caesarea Philippi
 he asked his disciples
 \u201cWho do people say the Son of Man is?\u201d","He asked them
 \u201cBut who do you say I am?\u201d","Then Jesus told him
 \u201cHow blessed you are
 Simon son of Jonah
 since flesh and blood has not revealed this to you
 though my Father in heaven has. ","I tell you that you are Peter
 and it is on this rock that I will build my congregation
 and the powers of hell will not conquer it. ","I will give you the keys to the kingdom from heaven. Whatever you prohibit on earth will have been prohibited in heaven
 and whatever you permit on earth will have been permitted in heaven.\u201d","But Jesus turned and told Peter
 \u201cGet behind me
 Satan! You are an offense to me
 because you are not thinking God\u2019s thoughts but human thoughts!\u201d","Then Jesus told his disciples
 \u201cIf anyone wants to follow me
 he must deny himself
 pick up his cross
 and follow me continuously. ","Whoever wants to save his life will lose it
 but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it
 ","because what profit will a person have if he gains the whole world and forfeits his life? Or what can a person give in exchange for his life?","The Son of Man is going to come with his angels in his Father\u2019s glory
 and then he will repay everyone according to what he has done. ","I tell all of you with certainty
 some people standing here will not experience death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.\u201d","But Jesus came up to them and touched them
 saying
 \u201cGet up
 and stop being afraid.\u201d ","On their way down the mountain
 Jesus ordered them
 \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone about this vision until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead.\u201d","He answered them
 \u201cElijah is indeed coming and will restore all things. ","But I tell you that Elijah has already come
 yet people did not recognize him and treated him just as they pleased. In the same way
 the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands.\u201d ","Jesus replied
 \u201cYou unbelieving and perverted generation! How long must I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring him here to me!\u201d ","He told them
 \u201cBecause of your lack of faith. I tell all of you with certainty
 if you have faith like a grain of mustard seed
 you can say to this mountain
 \u2018Move from here to there
\u2019 and it will move
 and nothing will be impossible for you. ","While they were gathering together in Galilee
 Jesus told them
 \u201cThe Son of Man is going to be betrayed into human hands. ","They will kill him
 but he will be raised on the third day.\u201d Then they were filled with grief.","He answered
 \u201cYes.\u201d When Peter went home
 Jesus spoke to him first and asked him
 \u201cWhat do you think
 Simon? From whom do kings on the earth collect tolls or tributes? From their own subjects
 or from foreigners?\u201d","\u201cFrom foreigners
\u201d he replied. So Jesus told him
 \u201cIn that case
 the subjects are exempt. ","However
 so that we don\u2019t offend them
 go to the sea and throw in a hook. Take the first fish that comes up
 open its mouth
 and you will find a coin. Take it and give it to them for me and you.\u201d","Then he said
 \u201cI tell all of you with certainty
 unless you change and become like little children
 you will never get into the kingdom from heaven. ","Therefore
 whoever humbles himself as this little child is the greatest in the kingdom from heaven
 ","and whoever receives a little child like this in my name receives me.\u201d","\u201cIf anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin
 it would be better for him if a large millstone were hung around his neck and he were drowned at the bottom of the sea. ","How terrible it will be for the world due to its temptations to sin! Temptations to sin are bound to happen
 but how terrible it will be for that person who causes someone to sin!","\u201cSo if your hand or your foot causes you to sin
 cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life injured or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire. ","And if your eye causes you to sin
 tear it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell fire.","\u201cSee to it that you do not despise one of these little ones
 because I tell you
 their angels in heaven always have access to my Father in heaven. ","\u201cWhat do you think? If a man has 100 sheep and one of them strays
 he leaves the 99 in the hills and goes to look for the one that has strayed
 doesn\u2019t he? ","If he finds it
 I tell all of you with certainty that he rejoices over it more than over the 99 that haven\u2019t strayed. ","In the same way
 it is not the will of your Father in heaven that one of these little ones should be lost.\u201d","\u201cIf your brother sins against you
 go and confront him while the two of you are alone. If he listens to you
 you have won back your brother. ","But if he doesn\u2019t listen
 take one or two others with you so that \u2018every word may be confirmed by the testimony of two or three witnesses.\u2019 ","If
 however
 he ignores them
 tell it to the congregation. If he also ignores the congregation
 regard him as an unbeliever and a tax collector.","\u201cI tell all of you with certainty
 whatever you prohibit on earth will have been prohibited in heaven
 and whatever you permit on earth will have been permitted in heaven. ","Furthermore
 I tell all of you with certainty that if two of you agree on earth about anything you request
 it will be done for you by my Father in heaven
 ","because where two or three have come together in my name
 I am there among them.\u201d","Jesus told him
 \u201cI tell you
 not just seven times
 but 77 times! ","\u201cThat is why the kingdom from heaven may be compared to a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.","When he had begun to settle the accounts
 a person who owed him 10
000 talents was brought to him. ","Because he couldn\u2019t pay
 his master ordered him
 his wife
 his children
 and everything that he owned to be sold so that payment could be made. ","Then the servant fell down and bowed low before him
 saying
 \u2018Be patient with me
 and I will repay you everything!\u2019 ","The master of that servant had compassion and released him
 canceling his debt.","\u201cBut when that servant went away
 he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii. He grabbed him
 seized him by the throat
 and said
 \u2018Pay what you owe!\u2019 ","Then his fellow servant fell down and began begging him
 \u2018Be patient with me and I will repay you!\u2019 ","But he refused and had him thrown into prison until he could repay the debt.","\u201cWhen his fellow servants saw what had happened
 they were very disturbed and went and reported to their master everything that had occurred. ","Then his master sent for him and told him
 \u2018You evil servant! I canceled that entire debt for you because you begged me. ","Shouldn\u2019t you have had mercy on your fellow servant
 just as I had mercy on you?\u2019 ","In anger his master handed him over to the jailers until he could repay the entire debt.","This is how my heavenly Father will treat each one of you unless you forgive your brother from your hearts.\u201d","He answered them
 \u201cHaven\u2019t you read that the one who made them at the beginning \u2018made them male and female\u2019 ","and said
 \u2018That is why a man will leave his father and mother and be united with his wife
 and the two will become one flesh\u2019? ","So they are no longer two
 but one flesh. Therefore
 what God has joined together
 man must never separate.\u201d","He told them
 \u201cIt was because of your hardness of heart that Moses allowed you to divorce your wives. But from the beginning it was not this way. ","I tell you that whoever divorces his wife
 except for sexual immorality
 and marries another woman commits adultery.\u201d","\u201cNot everyone can accept this saying
\u201d he replied
 \u201cexcept those to whom celibacy has been granted
 ","because some men are celibate from birth
 while some are celibate because they have been made that way by others. Still others are celibate because they have made themselves that way for the sake of the kingdom from heaven. Let anyone accept this who can.\u201d","Jesus
 however
 said
 \u201cLet the little children come to me
 and stop keeping them away
 because the kingdom from heaven belongs to people like these.\u201d ","Jesus asked him
 \u201cWhy ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good. If you want to get into that life
 you must keep the commandments.\u201d","The young man asked him
 \u201cWhich ones?\u201d Jesus said
 \u201c\u2018You must not murder
 you must not commit adultery
 you must not steal
 you must not give false testimony
 ","honor your father and mother
\u2019 and
 \u2018you must love your neighbor as yourself.\u2019\u201d","Jesus told him
 \u201cIf you want to be perfect
 go and sell what you own and give the money to the destitute
 and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come back and follow me.\u201d ","Then Jesus told his disciples
 \u201cI tell all of you with certainty
 it will be hard for a rich person to get into the kingdom from heaven. ","Again I tell you
 it is easier for a camel to squeeze through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to get into the kingdom of God.\u201d","Jesus looked at them intently and said
 \u201cFor humans this is impossible
 but for God all things are possible.\u201d","Jesus told them
 \u201cI tell all of you with certainty
 when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne in the renewed creation
 you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones
 governing the twelve tribes of Israel. ","In fact
 everyone who has left his homes
 brothers
 sisters
 father
 mother
 children

 and the last will be first.\u201d","\u201cThe kingdom from heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.","After agreeing to pay the workers one denarius a day
 he sent them into his vineyard. ","When he went out about nine o\u2019clock
 he saw others standing in the marketplace without work. ","He told them
 \u2018You go into the vineyard
 too
 and I will pay you whatever is right.\u2019 ","So off they went. He went out again about noon and about three o\u2019clock and did the same thing.","About five o\u2019clock he went out and found some others standing around. He asked them
 \u2018Why are you standing here all day long without work?\u2019 ","They told him
 \u2018Because no one has hired us.\u2019 He told them
 \u2018You go into the vineyard as well.\u2019","\u201cWhen evening came
 the owner of the vineyard told his manager
 \u2018Call the workers and give them their wages
 beginning with the last and ending with the first.\u2019 ","Those who were hired at five o\u2019clock came
 and each received a denarius.","\u201cWhen the first came
 they thought they would receive more
 but each received a denarius as well. ","When they received it
 they began to complain to the landowner
 ","\u2018These last fellows worked only one hour
 but you paid them the same as us
 and we\u2019ve been working all day
 enduring the scorching heat!\u2019","\u201cBut he told one of them
 \u2018Friend
 I\u2019m not treating you unfairly. You did agree with me for a denarius

 am I not? Or are you envious because I\u2019m generous?\u2019","\u201cIn the same way
 the last will be first
 and the first will be last
 because many are called
 but few are chosen.\u201d","\u201cSee
 we are going up to Jerusalem
 and the Son of Man will be handed over to the high priests and scribes

 \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d She told him
 \u201cPromise that in your kingdom these two sons of mine will sit on your right and on your left.\u201d","Jesus replied

 \u201cYou know that the rulers of the unbelievers lord it over them and their superiors act like tyrants over them. ","That\u2019s not the way it should be among you. Instead
 whoever wants to be great among you must be your servant
 ","and whoever wants to be first among you must be your slave.","That\u2019s the way it is with the Son of Man. He did not come to be served
 but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many people.\u201d","Jesus stopped and called them

 \u201cWhat do you want me to do for you?\u201d","told them
 \u201cGo into the village ahead of you. At once you will find a donkey tied up and a colt with it. Untie them

 \u2018My house is to be called a house of prayer
\u2019 but you are turning it into a hideout for bandits!\u201d","and asked him
 \u201cDo you hear what these people are saying?\u201d Jesus told them
 \u201cYes! Haven\u2019t you ever read
 \u2018From the mouths of infants and nursing babies you have created praise\u2019?\u201d ","Seeing a fig tree by the roadside
 he went up to it but found nothing on it except leaves. He told it
 \u201cMay fruit never come from you again!\u201d And immediately the fig tree dried up.","Jesus answered them
 \u201cI tell all of you with certainty
 if you have faith and do not doubt
 not only will you be able to do what has been done to the fig tree

\u2019 and it will happen. ","You will receive whatever you ask for in prayer
 if you believe.\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cI
 too
 will ask you one question. If you answer it for me
 I will also tell you by what authority I am doing these things. ","Where did John\u2019s authority to baptize come from? From heaven or from humans?\u201d They began discussing this among themselves: \u201cIf we say
 \u2018From heaven
\u2019 he will ask us
 \u2018Then why didn\u2019t you believe him?\u2019 ","So they told Jesus
 \u201cWe don\u2019t know.\u201d He in turn told them
 \u201cThen I won\u2019t tell you by what authority I am doing these things.\u201d","\u201cBut what do you think? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said
 \u2018Son

 \u2018I don\u2019t want to
\u2019 but later he changed his mind and went. ","Then the father went to the other son and told him the same thing. He replied
 \u2018I will

 you didn\u2019t change your minds at last and believe him.\u201d","\u201cListen to another parable. There was a landowner who planted a vineyard
 put a wall around it
 dug a wine press in it
 and built a watchtower. Then he leased it to tenant farmers and went abroad. ","When harvest time approached
 he sent his servants to the tenant farmers to collect his produce. ","But the farmers took his servants and beat one
 killed another
 and attacked another with stones. ","Again
 he sent other servants to them
 a greater number than the first

 he sent his son to them
 thinking
 \u2018They will respect my son.\u2019 ","But when the tenant farmers saw his son
 they told one another
 \u2018This is the heir. Come on
 let\u2019s kill him and get his inheritance!\u2019 ","So they grabbed him
 threw him out of the vineyard
 and killed him. ","Now when the owner of the vineyard returns
 what will he do to those farmers?\u201d","They told him
 \u201cHe will put those horrible men to a horrible death. Then he will lease the vineyard to other farmers who will give him his produce at harvest time.\u201d","Jesus asked them
 \u201cHave you never read in the Scriptures
 \u2018The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone. This was the Lord\u2019s doing
 and it is amazing in our eyes.\u2019?","That is why I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce fruit for it.","The person who falls over this stone will be broken to pieces
 but it will crush anyone on whom it falls.\u201d","\u201cThe kingdom from heaven may be compared to a king who gave a wedding banquet for his son.","He sent his servants to call those who had been invited to the wedding
 but they refused to come. ","So he sent other servants after saying
 \u2018Tell those who have been invited
 \u201cLook! I\u2019ve prepared my dinner. My oxen and fattened calves have been slaughtered. Everything is ready. Come to the wedding!\u201d\u2019 ","But they paid no attention to this and went away
 one to his farm
 another to his business. ","The rest grabbed the king\u2019s servants
 treated them brutally
 and then killed them. ","Then the king became outraged. He sent his troops
 and they destroyed those murderers and burned their city.","\u201cThen he told his servants
 \u2018The wedding is ready
 but those who were invited were not worthy. ","So go into the roads leading out of town and invite as many people as you can find to the wedding.\u2019","Those servants went out into the streets and brought in everyone they found
 evil and good alike
 and the wedding hall was packed with guests.","\u201cWhen the king came in to see the guests
 he noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes. ","He asked him
 \u2018Friend
 how did you get in here without wedding clothes?\u2019 But the man was speechless. ","Then the king told his servants
 \u2018Tie his hands and feet
 and throw him into the darkness outside!\u2019 In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth
 ","because many are invited
 but few are chosen.\u201d","Recognizing their wickedness
 Jesus asked
 \u201cWhy are you testing me
 you hypocrites? ","Show me the coin used for the tax.\u201d They brought him a denarius.","Then he asked them
 \u201cWhose face and name is this?\u201d","They told him
 \u201cCaesar\u2019s.\u201d So he told them
 \u201cThen give back to Caesar the things that are Caesar\u2019s
 and to God the things that are God\u2019s.\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cYou are mistaken because you don\u2019t know the Scriptures or God\u2019s power
 ","because in the resurrection
 people neither marry nor are given in marriage but are like the angels in heaven. ","As for the resurrection from the dead
 haven\u2019t you read what was spoken to you by God when he said
 ","\u2018I am the God of Abraham
 the God of Isaac

 \u201c\u2018You must love the Lord your God with all your heart

","\u2018The Lord told my Lord

 ","so do whatever they tell you and follow it

 ","then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains.","Anyone who\u2019s on the housetop must not come down to get what is in his house
 ","and anyone who\u2019s in the field must not turn back to get his coat.","\u201cHow terrible it will be for women who are pregnant or who are nursing babies in those days!","Pray that it may not be in winter or on a Sabbath when you flee
 ","because at that time there will be great suffering
 the kind that hasn\u2019t happened from the beginning of the world until now and certainly won\u2019t ever happen again. ","If those days hadn\u2019t been shortened
 no one would survive. But for the sake of the elect
 those days will be shortened.","\u201cAt that time
 if anyone says to you
 \u2018Look here! The Messiah!\u2019 or \u2018There he is!\u2019
 don\u2019t believe it
 ","because false messiahs and false prophets will have arisen and will produce great signs and startling demonstrations so as to deceive
 if possible
 even the elect. ","Remember
 I\u2019ve told you beforehand. ","So if they say to you
 \u2018Look! He\u2019s in the wilderness
\u2019 don\u2019t go out looking for him. And if they say
 \u2018Look! He\u2019s in the storeroom
\u2019 don\u2019t believe it
 ","because just as the lightning comes from the east and flashes as far as the west
 so will be the coming of the Son of Man. ","Wherever there\u2019s a corpse
 there the vultures will gather.","\u201cNow immediately after the troubles of those days
 \u2018The sun will be darkened
 the moon will not reflect its light
 the stars will fall from the sky
 and the powers from the heavens will be disrupted.\u2019","Then the sign that is the Son of Man will appear in the sky

 from one end of heaven to another.\u201d","\u201cNow learn a lesson from the fig tree. When its branches become tender and it produces leaves
 you know that summer is near. ","In the same way
 when you see all these things
 you\u2019ll know that the Son of Man is near
 right at the door. ","I tell all of you with certainty
 this generation won\u2019t disappear until these things take place. ","Heaven and earth will disappear
 but my words will never disappear.\u201d","\u201cNo one knows when that day and hour will come\u2014neither the heavenly angels nor the Son
 but only the Father
 ","because just as it was in Noah\u2019s time
 so it will be when the Son of Man comes. ","In those days before the flood
 people were eating and drinking
 marrying and giving in marriage right up to the day when Noah went into the ark. ","They were unaware of what was happening until the flood came and swept all of them away. That\u2019s how it will be when the Son of Man appears.","At that time
 two people will be in the field. One will be taken
 and one will be left behind. ","Two women will be grinding grain at the mill. One will be taken
 and one will be left behind.","\u201cSo keep on watching
 because you don\u2019t know on what day your Lord is coming. ","But be sure of this: if the owner of the house had known when during the night the thief would be coming
 he would have stayed awake and not allowed his house to be broken into. ","So you
 too
 must be ready
 because the Son of Man will come at an hour you are not expecting.\u201d","\u201cWho
 then
 is the faithful and wise servant whom his master has put in charge of his household to give the others their food at the right time? ","How blessed is that servant whom his master finds doing this when he comes!","I tell all of you with certainty
 he will put him in charge of all his property.","\u201cBut if that wicked servant says to himself
 \u2018My master has been delayed
\u2019 ","and begins to beat his fellow servants and eat and drink with the drunks
 ","that servant\u2019s master will come on a day when he doesn\u2019t expect him and at an hour that he doesn\u2019t know.","Then his master will punish him severely and assign him a place with the hypocrites. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\u201d","\u201cAt that time
 the kingdom from heaven will be comparable to ten bridesmaids who took their oil lamps and went out to meet the groom. ","Now five of them were foolish
 and five were wise
 ","because when the foolish ones took their lamps
 they didn\u2019t take any oil with them. ","But the wise ones took flasks of oil with their lamps.","Since the groom was late
 all of them became sleepy and lay down. ","But at midnight there came a shout: \u2018The groom is here! Come out to meet him!\u2019","Then all the bridesmaids woke up and got their lamps ready.","\u201cBut the foolish ones told the wise
 \u2018Give us some of your oil
 because our lamps are going out!\u2019","\u201cBut the wise ones replied
 \u2018No! There will never be enough for us and for you. You\u2019d better go to the dealers and buy some for yourselves.\u2019","\u201cWhile they were away buying it
 the groom arrived. Those who were ready went with him into the wedding banquet

 lord

 it is like a man going on a trip
 who called his servants and turned his money over to them. ","To one man he gave five talents
 to another two
 and to another one
 based on their ability. Then he went on his trip.","\u201cThe one who received five talents went out at once and invested them and earned five more.","In the same way

 I would\u2019ve received my money back with interest.\u2019 ","Then the master said
 \u2018Take the talent from him and give it to the man who has the ten talents

 more will be given

 and he would send me more than twelve legions of angels now? ","How
 then
 would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say this must happen?\u201d","At this point
 Jesus asked the crowds
 \u201cHave you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me as if I were a bandit? Day after day I sat teaching in the Temple
 yet you didn\u2019t arrest me. ","But all of this has happened so that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled.\u201d Then all the disciples deserted Jesus and ran away.","Jesus told him
 \u201cYou have said so. Nevertheless I tell you
 from now on you will see \u2018the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power\u2019 and \u2018coming on the clouds of heaven.\u2019\u201d","Peter remembered the words of Jesus when he said
 \u201cBefore a rooster crows
 you\u2019ll deny me three times.\u201d Then he went outside and cried bitterly.","Meanwhile
 Jesus was made to stand in front of the governor. The governor asked him
 \u201cAre you the king of the Jews?\u201d Jesus said
 \u201cYou say so.\u201d","About three o\u2019clock
 Jesus cried out with a loud voice
 \u201cEli
 eli
 lema sabachthani?\u201d
 which means
 \u201cMy God
 my God
 why have you forsaken me?\u201d","Suddenly
 Jesus met them and said
 \u201cGreetings!\u201d They went up to him
 took hold of his feet
 and worshipped him. ","Then Jesus told them
 \u201cStop being frightened! Go and tell my brothers to leave for Galilee
 and they will see me there.\u201d","Then Jesus approached them and told them
 \u201cAll authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. ","Therefore
 as you go
 disciple people in all nations
 baptizing them in the name of the Father
 and the Son
 and the Holy Spirit
 ","teaching them to obey everything that I\u2019ve commanded you. And remember
 I am with you each and every day until the end of the age.\u201d","And Jesus answering said unto him
 Suffer it to be so now
 for thus it is expedient for us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him.","But he answered and said
 It is written
 Man shall not live by bread alone
 but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.","Jesus said unto him
 It is written again
 Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.","Then Jesus said unto him
 Get thee hence
 Satan
 for it is written
 Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God
 and him only shalt thou serve.","From that time Jesus began to preach and to say
 Repent
 for the kingdom of the heavens is at hand.","And he said unto them
 Follow me
 and I will make you fishers of men.","Blessed are the poor in spirit
 for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.","Blessed are those that mourn
 for they shall be comforted.","Blessed are the meek
 for they shall inherit the earth.","Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness
 for they shall be satisfied.","Blessed are the merciful
 for they shall obtain mercy.","Blessed are the pure in heart
 for they shall see God.","Blessed are the peacemakers
 for they shall be called the sons of God.","Blessed are those who suffer persecution for righteousness\u2019 sake
 for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.","Blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake.","Rejoice and be exceeding glad
 for great is your reward in the heavens; for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.","Ye are the salt of the earth
 but if the salt has lost its savour
 with what shall it be salted? From then on it is good for nothing
 but to be cast out and to be trodden under foot of men.","Ye are the light of the world. A city set upon a mountain cannot be hid.","Neither do men light a lamp and put it under a bushel
 but on the lampstand
 and it gives light unto all that are in the house.","Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in the heavens.","Think not that I am come to undo the law or the prophets; I am not come to undo
 but to fulfil.","For verily I say unto you
 Until heaven and earth pass away
 not one jot or one tittle shall pass from the law until all is fulfilled.","Whosoever therefore shall undo one of these least commandments and shall teach men so
 he shall be called the least in the kingdom of the heavens; but whosoever shall do and teach them
 the same shall be called great in the kingdom of the heavens.","For I say unto you
 That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees
 ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of the heavens.","Ye have heard that it was said to the ancients
 Thou shalt not commit murder
 and whosoever shall commit murder shall be guilty of the judgment;","but I say unto you
 That whosoever is angry with his brother out of control shall be in danger of the judgment
 and whosoever shall insult his brother shall be in danger of the council
 but whosoever shall say
 Thou art impious
 shall be in danger of hell.","Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar
 and there remember that thy brother has something against thee;","leave thy gift there before the altar
 and go; first restore friendship with thy brother
 and then come and offer thy gift.","Conciliate with thine adversary quickly
 whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge
 and the judge deliver thee to the officer
 and thou be cast into prison.","Verily I say unto thee
 Thou shalt by no means come out of there
 until thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.","Ye have heard that it was said to the ancients
 Thou shalt not commit adultery;","but I say unto you
 That whosoever looks on a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart.","Therefore if thy right eye should bring thee occasion to stumble
 pluck it out and cast it from thee; for it is better for thee that one of thy members should perish
 and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.","And if thy right hand should bring thee occasion to stumble
 cut it off
 and cast it from thee: for it is better for thee that one of thy members should perish
 and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.","It was also said
 Whosoever shall put away his wife
 let him give her a bill of divorce;","but I say unto you
 That whosoever shall put away his wife
 except for the cause of fornication
 causes her to commit adultery; and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced commits adultery.","Again
 ye have heard that it was said to the ancients
 Thou shalt not perjure thyself
 but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths;","but I say unto you
 Swear not at all; neither by the heaven
 for it is God\u2019s throne
","nor by the earth
 for it is his footstool
 neither by Jerusalem
 for it is the city of the great King.","Neither shalt thou swear by thy head because thou canst not make one hair white or black.","But let your communication be
 Yes
 yes; No
 no; for whatsoever is more than this comes of evil.","Ye have heard that it was said
 An eye for an eye
 and a tooth for a tooth;","but I say unto you
 That ye resist not with evil
 but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek
 turn to him the other also.","And if anyone desires to sue thee at the law
 and take away thy clothing
 let him have thy cloak also.","And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile
 go with him two.","Give to him that asks of thee
 and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.","Ye have heard that it was said
 Thou shalt love thy neighbour
 and hate thine enemy.","But I say unto you
 Love your enemies
 bless those that curse you
 do good to those that hate you
 and pray for those who speak evil about you
 and persecute you;","that ye may be sons of your Father who is in the heavens
 for he makes his sun to rise on the evil and on the good and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.","For if ye love those who love you
 what reward shall ye have? Do not even the publicans the same?","And if ye embrace your brethren only
 what do ye more than others? Do not even the publicans so?","Be ye therefore perfect
 even as your Father who is in the heavens is perfect.","Take heed not to do your alms {lit. acts of mercy} before men
 to be seen of them; otherwise
 ye have no reward of your Father who is in the heavens.","Therefore
 when thou doest thine alms
 do not sound a trumpet before thee
 as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you
 They already have their reward.","But when thou doest alms
 let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth","that thine alms may be in secret; and thy Father who sees in secret
 he shall reward thee openly.","And when thou prayest
 thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are
 for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you
 They already have their reward.","But thou
 when thou prayest
 enter into thy chamber
 and when thou hast shut thy door
 pray to thy Father who is in secret; and thy Father who sees in secret shall reward thee openly.","But when ye pray
 use not vain repetitions as the worldly do
 for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.","Be not ye therefore like unto them
 for your Father knows what things ye have need of before ye ask him.","Ye
 therefore
 are to pray like this: Our Father who art in the heavens
 Hallowed be thy name.","Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth
 as it is in heaven.","Give us this day our daily bread.","And set us free from our debts
 as we set free our debtors.","And lead us not into temptation
 but deliver us from evil
 for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.","For if ye set men free from their trespasses
 your heavenly Father will also set you free;","but if ye do not set men free from their trespasses
 neither will your Father set you free from your trespasses.","Moreover when ye fast
 be not
 as the hypocrites
 of a sad countenance
 for they disfigure their faces that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you
 They already have their reward.","But thou
 when thou dost fast
 anoint thine head
 and wash thy face","that thou appear not unto men to fast
 but unto thy Father who is in secret; and thy Father
 who sees in secret
 shall reward thee openly.","Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon the earth
 where moth and rust corrupt
 and where thieves break through and steal;","but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven
 where neither moth nor rust corrupt and where thieves do not break through nor steal;","for where your treasure is
 there will your heart be also.","The lamp of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye is sincere
 thy whole body shall be full of light.","But if thine eye is evil
 thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If
 therefore
 the light that is in thee is darkness
 how great is that darkness!","No one can serve two masters
 for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and riches.","Therefore I say unto you
 Take no thought for your life
 what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink
 nor yet for your body
 what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than food
 and the body than raiment?","Behold the fowls of the air
 for they sow not
 neither do they reap nor gather into barns
 yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are ye not much better than they?","Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?","And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field
 how they grow: they toil not
 neither do they spin;","and yet I say unto you
 That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.","Therefore
 if God so clothes the grass of the field
 which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven
 shall he not much more clothe you
 O ye of little faith?","Therefore take no thought
 saying
 What shall we eat? or
 What shall we drink? or
 With what shall we be clothed?","(For the Gentiles seek after all these things.) For your heavenly Father knows that ye have need of all these things.","But seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness
 and all these things shall be added unto you.","Take therefore no thought for the morrow
 for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the affliction thereof.","Judge not
 that ye be not judged.","For with the judgment with which ye judge
 ye shall be judged
 and with the measure with which ye measure
 ye shall be measured again.","And why dost thou behold the mote that is in thy brother\u2019s eye but dost not consider the beam that is in thine own eye?","Or how wilt thou say to thy brother
 Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and
 behold
 a beam is in thine own eye?","Thou hypocrite
 first cast out the beam out of thine own eye
 and then shalt thou be able to see to cast out the mote out of thy brother\u2019s eye.","Give not that which is holy unto the dogs
 neither cast ye your pearls before swine
 lest they trample them under their feet and turn again and rend you.","Ask
 and it shall be given you; seek
 and ye shall find; knock
 and it shall be opened unto you;","for every one that asks receives
 and he that seeks finds
 and to him that knocks it shall be opened.","Or what man is there of you
 whom
 if his son asks for bread
 will he give him a stone?","Or if he asks for fish
 will he give him a serpent?","If ye then
 being evil
 know how to give good gifts unto your children
 how much more shall your Father who is in the heavens give good things to those that ask him?","Therefore
 all things whatsoever ye desire that men should do unto you
 so also shall ye do unto them
 for this is the law and the prophets.","Enter ye in at the narrow gate
 for the way that leads to destruction is wide and spacious
 and those who follow it are many;","because narrow is the gate
 and confined is the way which leads unto life
 and there are few that find it.","Keep yourselves also from the false prophets
 who come to you in sheep\u2019s clothing
 but inwardly they are ravening wolves.","Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns
 or figs of thistles?","Even so every good tree brings forth good fruit
 but a corrupt tree brings forth evil fruit.","A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit
 neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.","Every tree that does not bring forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire.","So that by their fruits ye shall know them.","Not every one that saith unto me
 Lord
 Lord
 shall enter into the kingdom of the heavens
 but he that doeth the will of my Father who is in the heavens.","Many will say to me in that day
 Lord
 Lord
 have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?","And then I will profess unto them
 I never knew you; depart from me
 ye that work iniquity.","Therefore
 whosoever hears these words of mine and does them
 I will liken him unto a prudent man
 who built his house upon the rock;","and the rain descended
 and the rivers came
 and the winds blew and beat upon that house
 and it did not fall
 for it was founded upon a rock.","And every one that hears these words of mine and does not do them shall be likened unto a foolish man
 who built his house upon the sand;","and the rain descended
 and the rivers came
 and the winds blew and beat upon that house
 and it fell; and great was the fall of it.","And Jesus put forth his hand
 and touched him
 saying
 I will; be thou clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.","Then Jesus said unto him
 See thou tell no one; but go
 show thyself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded
 for a testimony unto them.","And Jesus said unto him
 I will come and heal him.","When Jesus heard it
 he marvelled and said to those that followed
 Verily I say unto you that not even in Israel have I found such faith.","But I say unto you
 That many shall come from the east and west and shall sit down at the table with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of the heavens.","But the sons of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.","Then Jesus said unto the centurion
 Go
 and as thou hast believed
 so be it done unto thee. And his servant was healed in that same hour.","And Jesus said unto him
 The foxes have holes
 and the birds of the heaven have nests
 but the Son of man has nowhere to lay his head.","But Jesus said unto him
 Follow me
 and let the dead bury their dead.","And he said unto them
 Why are ye fearful
 O ye of little faith? Then
 awake
 he rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm.","And he said unto them
 Go. And when they were come out
 they went into the herd of swine; and
 behold
 the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea and perished in the waters.","And
 behold
 they brought him a paralyzed man
 lying on a bed; and Jesus
 seeing their faith
 said unto the paralyzed man
 Trust
 son; thy sins are forgiven thee.","And Jesus knowing their thoughts said
 Why think ye evil in your hearts?","For what is easier
 to say
 Thy sins are forgiven thee
 or to say
 Arise
 and walk?","But that ye may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins (then said he to the paralyzed man)
 Arise
 take up thy bed
 and go unto thine house.","And as Jesus passed forth from there
 he saw a man
 named Matthew
 sitting at the receipt of custom; and he said unto him
 Follow me. And he arose and followed him.","But when Jesus heard that
 he said unto them
 Those that are whole need not a physician
 but those that are sick.","Therefore go ye and learn what this is
 I will have mercy and not sacrifice
 for I am not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.","And Jesus said unto them
 Can the sons of the bridechamber mourn
 as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken from them
 and then they shall fast.","No one mends an old garment with a piece of new cloth
 for that patch takes from the garment
 and the rent is made worse.","Neither do they put new wine into old wineskins
 otherwise the wineskins break
 and the wine runs out
 and the wineskins perish; but they put new wine into new wineskins
 and both are preserved together.","But Jesus turned around
 and when he saw her
 he said
 Trust
 daughter; thy faith has made thee free. And the woman was free from that hour.","he said unto them
 Give place
 for the maid is not dead
 but sleeps. And they laughed him to scorn.","And when he was come into the house
 the blind men came to him; and Jesus said unto them
 Believe ye that I am able to do this? They said unto him
 Yes
 Lord.","And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly charged them
 saying
 See that no one knows it.","Then he said unto his disciples
 The harvest truly is plenteous
 but the labourers are few;","pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest
 that he will send forth labourers into his harvest.","These twelve Jesus sent forth and commanded them
 saying
 Do not go into the way of the Gentiles
 and do not enter into any city of the Samaritans
","but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.","And as ye go
 preach
 saying
 The kingdom of the heavens has come.","Heal the sick
 cleanse the lepers
 raise the dead
 cast out demons; freely ye have received
 freely give.","Provide neither gold nor silver nor money in your girdles
","nor bag for your journey
 neither two coats
 neither shoes nor a staff
 for the workman is worthy of his food.","And into whatever city or town ye shall enter
 search out with diligence who in it is worthy; and there abide until ye go from there.","And entering into the house
 salute it.","And if the house is worthy
 your peace shall come upon it; but if it is not worthy
 your peace shall return to you.","And whosoever shall not receive you nor hear your words
 depart out of that house or city and shake off the dust of your feet.","Verily I say unto you
 It shall be more tolerable for the land of those of Sodom and those of Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city.","Behold
 I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves; be ye therefore prudent as serpents and innocent as doves.","But keep yourselves from men
 for they will deliver you up in councils
 and they will scourge you in their synagogues;","and ye shall even be brought before princes and kings for my sake
 for testimony unto them and to the Gentiles.","But when they deliver you up
 take no thought how or what ye shall speak
 for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak.","For it is not ye that speak
 but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you.","And brother shall deliver up brother unto death
 and the father the child
 and children shall rise up against their parents and cause them to be put to death.","And ye shall be hated of all men for my name
 but he that endures to the end shall be saved.","But when they persecute you in this city
 flee ye into another
 for verily I say unto you
 Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel until the Son of man be come.","The disciple is not above his master
 nor the slave above his lord.","It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master
 and the slave as his lord. If they have called the husband of the house Beelzebub
 how much more shall they call those of his household?","Fear them not therefore
 for there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed
 nor hid that shall not be known.","What I tell you in darkness
 that speak ye in light
 and what ye hear in the ear
 that preach ye from the housetops.","And fear not those who kill the body but are not able to kill the soul
 but rather fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.","Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? And one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.","But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.","Fear ye not
 therefore; ye are of more value than many sparrows.","Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men
 him will I also confess before my Father who is in the heavens.","But whosoever shall deny me before men
 him will I also deny before my Father who is in the heavens.","Think not that I have come to introduce peace into the land; I came not to introduce peace
 but a sword.","For I have come to set a man at variance against his father
 and the daughter against her mother
 and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.","And a man\u2019s foes shall be those of his own household.","He that loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me
 and he that loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.","And he that does not take his cross {Gr. Stauros \u2013 stake} and follow after me is not worthy of me.","He that finds his life shall lose it
 and he that loses his life for my sake shall find it.","He that receives you receives me
 and he that receives me receives him that sent me.","He that receives a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet\u2019s reward
 and he that receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man\u2019s reward.","And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple
 verily I say unto you
 he shall in no wise lose his reward.","Jesus answered and said unto them
 Go and tell John those things which you hear and see:","The blind receive their sight
 and the lame walk; the lepers are cleansed
 and the deaf hear; the dead are raised up
 and the poor have the gospel preached to them.","And blessed is he who is not offended in me.","And as they departed
 Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John
 What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?","But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold
 those that wear soft clothing are in kings\u2019 houses.","But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes
 I say unto you
 and more than a prophet.","For this is he of whom it is written
 Behold
 I send my messenger before thy face
 who shall prepare thy way before thee.","Verily I say unto you
 Among those that are born of women there has not risen a greater than John the Baptist; notwithstanding
 he that is least in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he.","From the days of John the Baptist until now
 life is given unto the kingdom of the heavens
 and the valiant take hold of it.","For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.","And if ye will receive it
 this is that Elijah who was to come.","He that has ears to hear
 let him hear.","But unto whom shall I liken this generation? It is like unto children sitting in the markets and shouting unto their fellows","and saying
 We have piped unto you
 and ye have not danced; we have mourned unto you
 and ye have not lamented.","For John came neither eating nor drinking
 and they say
 He has a devil.","The Son of man came eating and drinking
 and they say
 Behold a gluttonous man and a winebibber
 a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified by her children.","Then he began to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done because they repented not:","Woe unto thee
 Chorazin! woe unto thee
 Bethsaida! for if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon
 they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.","But I say unto you
 It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment than for you.","And thou
 Capernaum
 which art exalted unto heaven
 shalt be brought down to Hades
 for if the mighty works which have been done in thee had been done in those of Sodom
 it would have remained until this day.","Therefore I say unto you
 That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for thee.","At that time Jesus answered and said
 I praise thee
 O Father
 Lord of heaven and earth
 because thou hast hid these things from the wise and understanding and hast revealed them unto children.","Even so
 Father
 for thus it was pleasing in thy sight.","All things are delivered unto me of my Father
 and no one has known the Son but the Father
 neither has anyone known the Father except the Son and he unto whom the Son will reveal him.","Come unto me
 all ye that labour and are heavy laden
 and I will give you rest.","Take my yoke upon you and learn of me
 for I am meek and humble of heart
 and ye shall find rest for your souls.","For my yoke is easy
 and my burden is light.","But he said unto them
 Have ye not read what David did
 and those that were with him
 when he was hungry
","how he entered into the house of God and ate the showbread
 which was not lawful for him to eat
 neither for those who were with him
 but only for the priests?","Or have ye not read in the law
 how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath and are blameless?","But I say unto you
 That in this place is one greater than the temple.","But if ye knew what this means
 I will have mercy and not sacrifice
 ye would not condemn the innocent.","For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day.","And he said unto them
 What man shall there be among you that shall have one sheep
 and if it falls into a pit on the sabbath day
 will he not lay hold on it and lift it out?","Therefore
 how much more is a man worth than a sheep? So that it is lawful to do good on the sabbath days.","Then he said to the man
 Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole
 like the other.","And Jesus knew their thoughts and said unto them
 Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation
 and every city or house divided against itself shall not remain;","and if Satan casts out Satan
 he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom remain?","And if I by Beelzebub cast out demons
 by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges.","But if I cast out the demons by the Spirit of God
 then certainly the kingdom of God is come unto you.","Or else how can one enter into the strong man\u2019s house and spoil his goods except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house.","He that is not with me is against me
 and he that does not gather with me scatters abroad.","Therefore I say unto you
 All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men
 but the blasphemy against the Spirit shall not be forgiven unto men.","And whosoever speaks a word against the Son of man
 it shall be forgiven him
 but whosoever speaks against the Holy Spirit
 it shall not be forgiven him
 neither in this age
 neither in the age to come.","Either make the tree good and its fruit good
 or else make the tree corrupt and its fruit corrupt; for the tree is known by its fruit.","O generation of vipers
 how can ye
 being evil
 speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.","The good man out of the good treasure of the heart brings forth good things
 and the evil man out of the evil treasure brings forth evil things.","But I say unto you
 That every idle word that men shall speak
 they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.","For by thy words thou shalt be justified
 and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.","But he answered and said unto them
 An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign
 and there no sign shall be given to it
 but the sign of the prophet Jonah;","for as Jonah was three days and three nights in the whale\u2019s belly
 so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.","The men of Nineveh shall rise in the judgment with this generation and shall condemn it because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and
 behold
 a greater than Jonah is here.","The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation and shall condemn it
 for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and
 behold
 a greater than Solomon is here.","When the unclean spirit is gone out of the man
 it walks through dry places
 seeking rest
 and finds none.","Then it says
 I will return into my house from which I came out; and when it is come
 it finds it empty
 swept
 and garnished.","Then it goes and takes with itself seven other spirits worse than itself
 and they enter in and dwell there; and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it also be unto this wicked generation.","While he yet talked to the people
 behold
 his mother and his brothers stood without
 desiring to speak with him.","But he answered and said unto him that told him
 Who is my mother? and who are my brothers?","And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples
 and said
 Behold my mother and my brothers!","For whosoever shall do the will of my Father who is in the heavens
 the same is my brother and sister and mother.","And he spoke many things unto them in parables
 saying
 Behold
 the sower went forth to sow;","and when he sowed
 some of the seed fell beside the way
 and the fowls came and devoured them up.","Some fell upon stony places
 where they had not much earth; and forthwith they sprang up because they had no deepness of earth;","and when the sun was up
 they were scorched; and because they had no root
 they withered away.","And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up and choked them.","But some fell into good ground and brought forth fruit: one a hundredfold and another sixtyfold and another thirtyfold.","who has ears to hear
 let him hear.","He answered and said unto them
 Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens
 but to them it is not given.","For whosoever has
 to him shall be given
 and he shall have in abundance; but whosoever has not
 from him shall be taken away even that which he has.","Therefore
 I speak to them in parables because seeing they see not
 and hearing they hear not
 neither do they understand.","And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah
 which says
 By hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand
 and seeing ye shall see and shall not perceive;","for this people\u2019s heart is waxed gross
 and their ears are dull of hearing
 and their eyes they have closed lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted
 and I should heal them.","But blessed are your eyes
 for they see
 and your ears
 for they hear.","For verily I say unto you
 That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see and have not seen them and to hear those things which ye hear and have not heard them.","Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.","When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it
 then the wicked one comes and catches away that which was sown in his heart. This is he who was planted beside the way.","But he that was planted in stony places
 the same is he that hears the word and receives it immediately with joy;","yet he has no root in himself but is temporal
 for when affliction or persecution arises because of the word
 by and by he is offended.","And he that was planted among the thorns is he that hears the word
 and the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word
 and he becomes unfruitful.","But he that was planted in good ground is he that hears the word and understands it and who also bears the fruit and brings forth: one a hundredfold and another sixty and another thirty.","He put forth another parable unto them
 saying
 The kingdom of the heavens is likened unto a man who sows good seed in his field","But while men slept
 his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat and went away.","But when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit
 then the tares appeared also.","So the slaves of the husband of the house came and said unto him
 Lord
 didst thou not sow good seed in thy field? From where then does it have tares?","He said unto them
 The enemy
 a man
 has done this. The slaves said unto him
 Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?","But he said
 No
 lest while ye gather up the tares
 ye root up also the wheat with them.","Let both grow together until the harvest
 and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers
 Gather ye together first the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them
 but gather the wheat into my barn.","He put forth another parable unto them
 saying
 The kingdom of the heavens is like unto a grain of mustard seed
 which a man took and sowed in his field;","which indeed is the smallest of all the seeds
 but when it is grown
 it is the greatest among herbs and becomes a tree
 so that the birds of the heaven come and make their nests in its branches.","He spoke another parable unto them: The kingdom of the heavens is like unto leaven
 which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened.","He answered and said unto them
 He that sows the good seed is the Son of man;","the field is the world; the good seed are the sons of the kingdom
 but the tares are the sons of the wicked;","and the enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the age
 and the reapers are the angels.","As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire
 so shall it be in the end of this age.","The Son of man shall send forth his angels
 and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend and those who do iniquity","and shall cast them into the furnace of fire; there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.","Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears to hear
 let him hear.","Again
 the kingdom of the heavens is like unto treasure hid in the field
 which when found
 a man hides it and
 for the joy thereof
 goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.","Again
 the kingdom of the heavens is like unto a merchant man
 seeking goodly pearls
","who
 when he had found one pearl of great price
 went and sold all that he had and bought it.","Again
 the kingdom of the heavens is like unto a net that was cast into the sea and gathered of every kind of fish
","which
 when it was full
 they drew to shore and sat down and gathered the good into vessels
 but cast the bad away.","So shall it be at the end of the age; the angels shall come forth and separate the wicked from among the just","and shall cast them into the furnace of fire; there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.","Jesus said unto them
 Have ye understood all these things? They answered unto him
 Yes
 Lord.","And he said unto them
 Therefore every scribe who is instructed in the kingdom of the heavens is like unto a man
 a husband of a house
 who brings forth out of his treasure things new and old.","And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them
 A prophet is not without honour except in his own country and in his own house.","But Jesus said unto them
 They need not depart; give ye them to eat.","He said
 Bring them here to me.","But straightway Jesus spoke unto them
 saying
 Trust that I AM; be not afraid.","And he said
 Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship
 he walked upon the water to go to Jesus.","And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and said unto him
 O thou of little faith
 why didst thou doubt?","But he answered and said unto them
 Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?","For God commanded
 saying
 Honour thy father and mother
 and
 He that curses father or mother
 let him die without recourse.","But ye say
 Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother
 Whatever I might have helped thee with is already my offering unto God
","and now has no need to honour his father or his mother with succour. Thus ye have made the commandment of God of no effect by your tradition.","Ye hypocrites
 well did Isaiah prophesy of you
 saying
","This people draws nigh unto me with their mouth and honours me with their lips
 but their heart is far from me.","But in vain do they worship me
 teaching doctrines and commandments of men.","And calling the multitude unto him
 he said unto them
 Hear and understand:","not that which goes into the mouth defiles the man; but that which comes out of the mouth
 this defiles the man.","But he answered and said
 Every plant which my heavenly Father has not planted shall be rooted up.","Let them alone; they are blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind
 both shall fall into a pit.","And Jesus said
 Are ye also yet without understanding?","Do not ye yet understand that whatever enters in at the mouth goes into the belly and is cast out into the draught?","But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart
 and they defile the man.","For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts
 murders
 adulteries
 fornications
 thefts
 false witness
 blasphemies:","these are the things which defile the man
 but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile the man.","But he answered and said
 I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.","But he answered and said
 It is not good to take the children\u2019s bread and to cast it to the little dogs.","Then Jesus answered and said unto her
 O woman
 great is thy faith; be it unto thee even as thou desire. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.","Then Jesus called his disciples unto him and said
 I have mercy on the multitude because they persevere with me now three days and have nothing to eat
 and I desire not to send them away fasting lest they faint in the way.","And Jesus said unto them
 How many loaves have ye? And they said
 Seven and a few little fishes.","But he answered and said unto them
 When it is evening
 ye say
 It will be fair weather
 for the heaven is glowing with an aurora.","And in the morning
 It will be foul weather today
 for the heaven has an aurora and is cloudy. O ye hypocrites
 ye know how to make decisions based on the face of the heaven
 and regarding the signs of the times are ye unable?","A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign; and no sign shall be given unto it
 but the sign of the prophet Jonah. And he left them and departed.","Then Jesus said unto them
 Take heed and keep yourselves from the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.","Which when Jesus perceived
 he said unto them
 O ye of little faith
 why reason ye among yourselves that ye have brought no bread?","Do ye not yet understand
 neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand
 and how many baskets ye took up?","Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand
 and how many baskets ye took up?","How is it that ye do not understand that I did not speak to you concerning bread that ye should keep yourselves from the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?","When Jesus came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi
 he asked his disciples
 saying
 Who do men say that I the Son of man am?","He said unto them
 But who say ye that I am?","And Jesus answered and said unto him
 Blessed art thou
 Simon son of Jonah
 for flesh and blood has not revealed it unto thee
 but my Father who is in the heavens.","And I say also unto thee
 That thou art Peter
 a small rock and upon the large rock I will build my congregation
 {Gr. ekklesia \u2013 called out ones} and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against her.","And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of the heavens
 and whatever thou shalt bind on the earth shall be bound in the heavens
 and whatever thou shalt loose on the earth shall be loosed in the heaven.","But he turned and said unto Peter
 Remove thyself from before me
 Satan; thou art an offence unto me
 for thou dost not understand that which is of God
 but that which is of men.","Then Jesus said unto his disciples
 If anyone will come after me
 let him deny himself and take up his cross {Gr. Stauros \u2013 stake} and follow me.","For whosoever desires to save his life shall lose it
 and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.","For what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?","For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels
 and then he shall reward everyone according to their works.","Verily I say unto you
 There are some standing here who shall not taste of death until they have seen the Son of man coming in his kingdom.","Then Jesus came and touched them and said
 Arise and be not afraid.","And as they came down from the mountain
 Jesus charged them
 saying
 Tell the vision to no one until the Son of man is risen from the dead.","And Jesus answered and said unto them
 Elijah truly shall come first and restore all things.","But I say unto you
 That Elijah is come already
 and they knew him not
 but have done unto him whatever they pleased. Likewise the Son of man shall also suffer of them.","Then Jesus answered and said
 O unfaithful and crooked generation
 how long shall I be with you? How long shall I suffer you? Bring him here to me.","And Jesus said unto them
 Because of your unfaithfulness; for verily I say unto you
 If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed
 ye shall say unto this mountain
 Remove from here to yonder place
 and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.","And while they abode in Galilee
 Jesus said unto them
 The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men;","and they shall kill him
 and the third day he shall be raised again. And they were exceeding sorry.","He said
 Yes. And when he was come into the house
 Jesus spoke unto him first
 saying
 What thinkest thou
 Simon? of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own sons or of strangers?","Peter said unto him
 Of strangers. Jesus said unto him
 Then the sons are free.","Notwithstanding
 lest we should offend them
 go thou to the sea and cast a hook and take up the first fish that comes up; and when thou hast opened his mouth
 thou shalt find a stater
 a coin worth four drachmas; take that
 and give it unto them for me and thee.","and said
 Verily I say unto you
 Except ye be converted and become as little children
 ye shall not enter into the kingdom of the heavens.","Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child
 the same is greatest in the kingdom of the heavens.","And whosoever shall receive one such little child in my name receives me.","But whosoever shall cause one of these little ones who believe in me to fall
 it would be better for him that a millstone such as is turned by an ass be hanged about his neck and that he be sunk in the depth of the sea.","Woe unto the world because of offenses! For it must needs be that offenses come
 but woe to that man by whom the offense comes!","Therefore if thy hand or thy foot cause thee to fall
 cut them off and cast them from thee; it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed
 rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into eternal fire.","And if thine eye causes thee to fall
 pluck it out and cast it from thee; it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye
 rather than having two eyes to be cast into the hell of fire.","Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you
 That in the heavens their angels always behold the face of my Father who is in the heavens.","What do you think? If a man had a hundred sheep and one of them went astray
 would he not leave the ninety-nine and go into the mountains and seek that which is gone astray?","And if so be that he finds it
 verily I say unto you
 he rejoices more of that one than of the ninety-nine who did not go astray.","Even so it is not the will of your Father who is in the heavens that one of these little ones should perish.","Therefore if thy brother shall sin against thee
 go and reprove him between thee and him alone; if he shall hear thee
 thou hast gained thy brother.","But if he will not hear thee
 then take with thee one or two more that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.","And if he shall neglect to hear them
 tell it unto the congregation; {Gr. ekklesia \u2013 called out ones} but if he neglects to hear the congregation
 {Gr. ekklesia \u2013 called out ones} let him be unto thee as a worldly man and a publican.","Verily I say unto you
 Whatever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in the heaven; and whatever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in the heaven.","Again I say unto you
 That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask
 it shall be done for them of my Father who is in the heavens.","For where two or three are gathered together in my name
 there am I in the midst of them.","Jesus said unto him
 I say not unto thee
 Until seven times
 but
 Until seventy times seven.","Therefore is the kingdom of the heavens likened unto a man who is king who would take account of his slaves.","And when he had begun to reckon
 one was brought unto him who owed him ten thousand talents.","But he not having wherewith to pay
 his lord commanded him to be sold
 and his wife and children and all that he had
 to make payment.","The slave therefore fell down and worshipped him
 saying
 Lord
 have patience with me
 and I will pay thee all.","Then the lord of that slave was moved with compassion and loosed him and forgave him the debt.","But as the same slave was leaving
 he found one of his fellowslaves who owed him a hundred denarius
 and he laid hands on him and took him by the throat
 saying
 Pay me what thou owest.","And his fellowslave fell down at his feet and besought him
 saying
 Have patience with me
 and I will pay thee all.","And he would not
 but went and cast him into prison until he should pay the debt.","So when his fellowslaves saw what was done
 they were very grieved and came and declared unto their lord all that was done.","Then his lord
 after he had called him
 said unto him
 O thou wicked slave
 I forgave thee all that debt because thou didst beseech me;","was it not also expedient unto thee to have mercy on thy fellowslave even as I had mercy on thee?","And his lord was wroth and delivered him to the tormentors until he should pay all that was due unto him.","So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you unless from your hearts ye forgive every one his brother their trespasses.","And he answered and said unto them
 Have ye not read
 that he who made them at the beginning made them male and female?","And said
 For this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall be joined to his wife
 and they shall be two in one flesh.","Therefore they are no longer two
 but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together
 let not man separate.","He said unto them
 Moses
 because of the hardness of your hearts
 suffered you to put away your wives
 but from the beginning it was not so.","And I say unto you
 Whosoever shall put away his wife
 except it be for fornication and shall marry another
 commits adultery
 and whosoever marries her that is put away commits adultery.","But he said unto them
 Everyone cannot receive this word
 except those unto whom it is given.","For there are some eunuchs who were so born from their mother\u2019s womb; and there are some eunuchs who were made eunuchs of men; and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs because of the kingdom of the heavens. He that is able to receive it
 let him receive it.","But Jesus said
 Suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not
 for of such is the kingdom of the heavens.","And he said unto him
 Why dost thou call me good? There is none good but one
 that is
 God
 but if thou wilt enter into life
 keep the commandments.","He said unto him
 Which? Jesus said
 Thou shalt not murder
 Thou shalt not commit adultery
 Thou shalt not steal
 Thou shalt not bear false witness
","Honour thy father and thy mother
 and
 Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.","Jesus said unto him
 If thou desire to be perfect
 go and sell what thou hast and give it to the poor
 and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come and follow me.","Then said Jesus unto his disciples
 Verily I say unto you
 It is difficult that a rich man shall enter into the kingdom of the heavens.","And again I say unto you
 It is easier to put a cable through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.","But Jesus beheld them and said unto them
 With men this is impossible
 but with God all things are possible.","And Jesus said unto them
 Verily I say unto you
 That ye who have followed me
 in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory
 ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones
 to judge the twelve tribes of Israel.","And every one that has forsaken houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my name\u2019s sake shall receive a hundredfold and shall inherit eternal life.","But many that are first shall be last
 and many of the last shall be first.","For the kingdom of the heavens is like unto a man
 the husband of a house
 who went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard.","And when he had agreed with the labourers for a denarius a day
 he sent them into his vineyard.","And he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the marketplace","and said unto them
 Go ye also into the vineyard
 and whatever is right I will give you. And they went.","Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour and did likewise.","And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing idle and said unto them
 Why stand ye here all the day idle?","They say unto him
 Because no one has hired us. He said unto them
 Go ye also into the vineyard
 and whatever is right
 that shall ye receive.","So when evening was come
 the lord of the vineyard said unto his steward
 Call the labourers and give them their hire
 beginning from the last unto the first.","And when those came that were hired about the eleventh hour
 they received every man a denarius.","But when the first came
 they supposed that they should have received more but they likewise received each one a denarius.","And when they had received it
 they murmured against the husband of the house
","saying
 These last have worked but one hour
 and thou hast made them equal unto us who have borne the burden and heat of the day.","But he answered one of them and said
 Friend
 I do thee no wrong; didst not thou agree with me for a denarius?","Take that which is thine and go
 for I desire to give unto this last one
 even as unto thee.","Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil because I am good?","So the first shall be last
 and the last first; for many are called
 but few are chosen.","Behold
 we go up to Jerusalem
 and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the princes of the priests and unto the scribes
 and they shall condemn him to death","and shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock and to scourge and to crucify; {Gr. stauroo \u2013 Hang on a stake} and the third day he shall rise again.","And he said unto her
 What dost thou desire? She said unto him
 Grant that these my two sons may sit the one on thy right hand and the other on the left in thy kingdom.","But Jesus answered and said
 Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say unto him
 We are able.","But Jesus called them unto him and said
 Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them
 and those that are great wield power over them.","But it shall not be so among you
 but whosoever will be great among you
 let him be your minister;","and whosoever will be chief among you
 let him be your slave
","even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto
 but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many.","And Jesus stood still and called them and said
 What desire ye that I shall do unto you?","saying unto them
 Go into the village over against you
 and straightway ye shall find an ass tied and a colt with her; loose them and bring them unto me.","And if anyone says anything unto you
 ye shall say
 The Lord has need of them; and straightway he will send them.","and said unto them
 It is written
 My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.","and said unto him
 Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus said unto them
 Yes; have ye never read
 Out of the mouth of children and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?","And when he saw a fig tree in the way
 he came to it and found nothing upon it
 but leaves only
 and said unto it
 Let no fruit grow on thee from now on for ever. And then the fig tree withered away.","Jesus answered and said unto them
 Verily I say unto you
 If ye have faith and doubt not
 ye shall not only do this to the fig tree
 but also if ye shall say unto this mountain
 Be thou removed
 and be thou cast into the sea
 it shall be done.","And all things
 whatever ye shall ask in prayer
 believing
 ye shall receive.","And Jesus answered and said unto them
 I also will ask you a word
 which if ye tell me
 I will also tell you by what authority I do these things.","The baptism of John
 where was it from? from heaven or of men? And they reasoned with themselves
 saying
 If we shall say
 From heaven
 he will say unto us
 Why did ye not then believe him?","And they answered Jesus and said
 We cannot tell. And he said unto them
 Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.","But what do you think? A certain man had two sons
 and he came to the first and said
 Son
 go work today in my vineyard.","He answered and said
 I will not
 but afterward he repented and went.","And he came to the second and said likewise. And he answered and said
 I will go
 Lord
 and went not.","Which of the two did the will of his father? They say unto him
 The first. Jesus said unto them
 Verily I say unto you
 That the publicans and the harlots go ahead of you into the kingdom of God.","For John came unto you in the way of righteousness
 and ye believed him not
 but the publicans and the harlots believed him
 and ye
 when ye had seen it
 repented not afterward that ye might believe him.","Hear another parable: There was a certain husband of a house who planted a vineyard and hedged it round about and dug a winepress in it and built a tower and let it out to husbandmen and went into a far country
","and when the time of the fruit drew near
 he sent his slaves to the husbandmen that they might receive the fruits of it.","And the husbandmen took his slaves and beat one and killed another and stoned another.","Again
 he sent other slaves more than the first
 and they did unto them likewise.","But last of all he sent unto them his son
 saying
 They will reverence my son.","But when the husbandmen saw the son
 they said among themselves
 This is the heir; come
 let us kill him
 and let us take his inheritance.","And they took hold of him and cast him out of the vineyard and slew him.","Therefore
 when the lord of the vineyard comes
 what will he do unto those husbandmen?","They say unto him
 He will destroy those wicked men without mercy and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen who shall render him the fruits in their seasons.","Jesus said unto them
 Did ye never read in the scriptures
 The stone which the builders rejected
 the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord\u2019s doing
 and it is marvellous in our eyes?","Therefore say I unto you
 The kingdom of God shall be taken from you and given to a people bringing forth the fruits thereof.","And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken
 but on whomsoever it shall fall
 it will grind him to powder.","The kingdom of the heavens is like unto a certain man
 a king
 who made a marriage feast for his son","and sent forth his slaves to call those that were invited to the wedding
 and they would not come.","Again
 he sent forth other slaves
 saying
 Tell those who are invited
 Behold
 I have prepared my dinner; my bulls and my fatlings are killed
 and all things are ready; come unto the marriage.","But they made light of it and went their ways
 one to his farm
 another to his merchandise
","and the others took his slaves and entreated them spitefully and slew them.","But when the king heard of this
 he became angry and sent forth his armies and destroyed those murderers and burned up their city.","Then he said to his slaves
 The wedding is ready
 but those who were called were not worthy.","Go ye therefore into the entrances of the highways and call as many as ye shall find to the marriage.","So those slaves went out into the highways and gathered together everyone that they found
 both bad and good; and the wedding was filled with guests.","And when the king came in to see the guests
 he saw there a man who did not have on a wedding garment
","and he said unto him
 Friend
 how didst thou come in here not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.","Then the king said to the slaves
 Bind him hand and foot and take him away and cast him into the darkness outside; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.","For many are called
 but few are chosen.","But Jesus perceived their wickedness and said
 Why tempt ye me
 ye hypocrites?","Show me the coin of the tribute. And they presented unto him a denarius.","And he said unto them
 Whose is this image and supion?","They say unto him
 Caesar\u2019s. Then said he unto them
 Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar\u2019s and unto God the things that are God\u2019s.","Then Jesus answered and said unto them
 Ye do err
 not knowing the scriptures nor the power of God.","For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage
 but are as the angels of God in heaven.","But concerning the resurrection of the dead
 have ye not read that which is spoken unto you by God
 who saith
","I AM the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead
 but of the living.","Jesus said unto him
 Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind.","This is the first and great commandment.","And the second is like unto it
 Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.","On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.","saying
 What think ye of the Christ? Whose son is he? They say unto him
 The Son of David.","He said unto them
 How then does David in Spirit call him Lord
 saying
","The LORD said unto my Lord
 Sit thou on my right hand until I make thine enemies thy footstool?","If David then calls him Lord
 how is he his son?","saying
 The scribes and the Pharisees have sat down in Moses\u2019 seat;","therefore
 whatever they bid you to observe
 observe it and do it
 but do not act according to their works
 for they say and do not do it.","For they bind burdens that are heavy and grievous to bear and lay them on men\u2019s shoulders
 but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers.","But they do all their works that they may be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries and enlarge the borders of their garments","and love the first place at feasts and the chief seats in the synagogues","and greetings in the markets and to be called of men
 Rabbi
 Rabbi.","But
 as for you
 desire not to be called Rabbi
 for one is your Master
 the Christ; and you are all brothers.","And call no one your father upon the earth
 for one is your Father
 who is in the heavens.","Neither be ye called masters
 for one is your Master
 the Christ.","But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.","And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be humbled
 and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted.","But woe unto you
 scribes and Pharisees
 hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of the heavens in front of men
 for ye neither go in yourselves
 neither suffer ye those that are entering to go in.","Woe unto you
 scribes and Pharisees
 hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte
 and when he is made
 ye make him twofold more a son of hell than yourselves.","Woe unto you
 ye blind guides
 who say
 Whosoever shall swear by the temple
 it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple
 he is a debtor!","Ye fools and blind
 for which is greater
 the gold or the temple that sanctifies the gold?","And
 Whosoever shall swear by the altar
 it is nothing; but whosoever swears by the gift that is upon it
 he is a debtor.","Ye fools and blind
 for which one is greater
 the gift or the altar that sanctifies the gift?","Whosoever therefore shall swear by the altar
 swears by it and by all things thereon.","And whosoever shall swear by the temple
 swears by it and by Him that dwells therein.","And he that shall swear by the heaven
 swears by the throne of God and by Him that sits thereon.","Woe unto you
 scribes and Pharisees
 hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin and have omitted that which is more important of the law: judgment
 mercy
 and faith; these were expedient for ye to have done
 and not to leave the other undone.","Ye blind guides
 who strain at a gnat and swallow a camel.","Woe unto you
 scribes and Pharisees
 hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup or of the platter
 but within they are full of extortion and incontinence.","Thou blind Pharisee
 cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter that the outside of them may be clean also.","Woe unto you
 scribes and Pharisees
 hypocrites! for ye are like unto whitewashed sepulchres
 who indeed appear beautiful outside
 but inside are full of dead men\u2019s bones and of all uncleanness.","Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men
 but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.","Woe unto you
 scribes and Pharisees
 hypocrites! because ye build the tombs of the prophets and adorn the sepulchres of the righteous","and say
 If we had been in the days of our fathers
 we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.","Therefore ye are witnesses unto yourselves that ye are the sons of those who murdered the prophets.","Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers.","Ye serpents
 ye generation of vipers
 how can ye escape the judgment of hell?","Therefore
 behold
 I send unto you prophets and wise men and scribes
 and some of them ye shall kill and crucify
 {Gr. stauroo \u2013 Hang on a stake} and some of them ye shall scourge in your synagogues and persecute them from city to city
","that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias
 whom ye murdered between the temple and the altar.","Verily I say unto you
 All these things shall come upon this generation.","O Jerusalem
 Jerusalem
 thou that didst kill the prophets and stone those who are sent unto thee
 how often I desired to gather thy children together
 even as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings
 and ye would not!","Behold
 your house is left unto you desolate.","For I say unto you
 Ye shall not see me from now on until ye shall say
 Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord.","And Jesus said unto them
 See ye not all these things? verily I say unto you
 There shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down.","And Jesus answered and said unto them
 Take heed that no one deceive you.","For many shall come in my name
 saying
 I am the Christ
 and shall deceive many.","And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars; see that ye be not troubled
 for it is necessary that all these things must take place; but the end is not yet.","For nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom
 and there shall be famines and pestilences and earthquakes in different places.","All these are the beginning of sorrows.","Then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you
 and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name\u2019s sake.","And then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another.","And many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many.","And because lawlessness shall abound
 the charity of many shall wax cold.","But he that shall endure unto the end
 the same shall be saved.","And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations
 and then shall the end come.","Therefore
 when ye see the abomination of desolation
 spoken of by Daniel the prophet
 which shall stand in the holy place (whosoever reads
 let him understand)
","then let those who are in Judaea flee into the mountains;","let him who is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house
","neither let him who is in the field return back to take his clothes.","And woe unto those that are with child and to those that give suck in those days!","But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter neither on the sabbath day
","for then shall be great tribulation
 such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time
 no
 nor ever shall be.","And if those days were not shortened
 no flesh would be saved; but for the elect\u2019s sake those days shall be shortened.","Then if any man shall say unto you
 Behold
 here is the Christ
 or there
 believe it not.","For there shall arise false Christs and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in such a manner that they shall deceive
 if possible
 the very elect.","Behold
 I have told you before.","Therefore if they say unto you
 Behold
 he is in the desert
 go not forth; Behold
 he is in the secret chambers
 believe it not.","For as the lightning that comes out of the east and shines even unto the west
 so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.","For wherever the carcase is
 there will the eagles be gathered together.","Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened
 and the moon shall not give her light
 and the stars shall fall from the heaven
 and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken
","and then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven
 and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn
 and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with great power and glory.","And he shall send his angels with a trumpet and a great voice
 and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds
 from one end of heaven to the other.","Now learn a parable of the fig tree: When his branch is yet tender and puts forth leaves
 ye know that summer is nigh;","so likewise ye
 when ye shall see all these things
 know that it is near
 even at the doors.","Verily I say unto you
 This generation shall not pass until all these things are fulfilled.","The heaven and the earth shall pass away
 but my words shall not pass away.","But of that day and hour no one knows
 no
 not even the angels of the heavens
 but my Father only.","But as the days of Noah were
 so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.","For as they were in the days before the flood
 eating and drinking
 marrying and giving in marriage
 until the day that Noah entered into the ark
","and they knew not until the flood came and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.","Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken and the other left.","Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken and the other left.","Watch therefore
 for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.","But know this that if the husband of the house knew in what watch the thief would come
 he would watch and would not suffer his house to be broken into.","Therefore be ye also ready; the Son of man is to come in the hour that ye think not.","Who then is the faithful and prudent slave
 whom his lord has made ruler over his household to give them food in due season?","Blessed is that slave whom his lord when he comes shall find so doing.","Verily I say unto you
 That he shall make him ruler over all his goods.","But and if that evil slave shall say in his heart
 My lord delays his coming
","and shall begin to smite his fellowslaves and even to eat and drink with the drunken
","the lord of that slave shall come in a day when he does not look for him and in an hour that he is not aware of","and shall cut him off and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.","Then shall the kingdom of the heavens be likened unto ten virgins who
 taking their lamps
 went forth to meet the bridegroom.","And five of them were prudent
 and five were foolish.","Those that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them;","but the prudent took oil in their vessels with their lamps.","While the bridegroom tarried
 they all slumbered and slept.","And at midnight there was a cry made
 Behold
 the bridegroom comes; go ye out to meet him.","Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps.","And the foolish said unto the prudent
 Give us of your oil
 for our lamps are going out.","But the prudent answered
 saying
 Lest there be not enough for us and you
 but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves.","And while they went to buy
 the bridegroom came; and those that were ready went in with him to the marriage
 and the door was shut.","Afterward the other virgins also came
 saying
 Lord
 Lord
 open to us.","But he answered and said
 Verily I say unto you
 I know you not.","Watch
 therefore
 for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man comes.","For it is like a man travelling into a far country
 who called his own slaves and delivered unto them his goods.","And unto one he gave five talents
 to another two
 and to another one
 to each one according to his faculty
 and straightway took his journey.","And after he was gone
 he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same and made another five talents.","And likewise he that had received two
 he also gained another two.","But he that had received one went and dug in the earth and hid his lord\u2019s money.","And after a long time the lord of those slaves came and reckoned accounts with them.","And so he that had received five talents came and brought another five talents
 saying
 Lord
 thou didst deliver unto me five talents; behold
 I have gained beside them five talents more.","His lord said unto him
 Well done
 thou good and faithful slave; thou hast been faithful over a few things; I will set thee over many things; enter thou into the joy of thy lord.","He also that had received two talents came and said
 Lord
 thou didst deliver unto me two talents; behold
 I have gained two other talents beside them.","His lord said unto him
 Well done
 good and faithful slave; thou hast been faithful over a few things; I will set thee over many things; enter thou into the joy of thy lord.","Then he who had received the one talent came and said
 Lord
 I knew thee that thou art a hard man
 reaping where thou hast not sown and gathering where thou hast not scattered;","therefore
 I was afraid and went and hid thy talent in the earth; behold
 thou hast what is thine.","His lord answered and said unto him
 Thou wicked and slothful slave
 thou knewest that I reap where I did not sow and gather where I have not scattered;","therefore
 it was expedient for thee to have put my money to the bankers
 and then at my coming I should have received mine own with interest.","Take
 therefore
 the talent from him and give it unto him who has ten talents.","For unto every one that has shall be given
 and he shall have abundance
 but from him that has not shall be taken away even that which he has.","And cast ye the unprofitable slave into the outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.","When the Son of man shall come in his glory and all the holy angels with him
 then he shall sit upon the throne of his glory
","and before him shall be gathered all nations; and he shall separate them one from another as a shepherd divides his sheep from the goats
","and he shall set the sheep on his right hand
 but the goats on the left.","Then shall the King say unto those on his right hand
 Come
 ye blessed of my Father
 inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world;","for I was hungry
 and ye gave me food; I was thirsty
 and ye gave me drink; I was a stranger
 and ye took me in;","naked
 and ye clothed me; I was sick
 and ye visited me; I was in prison
 and ye came unto me.","Then shall the righteous answer him
 saying
 Lord
 when did we see thee hungry and feed thee? or thirsty and give thee drink?","When did we see thee a stranger and take thee in? or naked and clothe thee?","Or when did we see thee sick or in prison and come unto thee?","And the King shall answer and say unto them
 Verily I say unto you
 Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brothers
 ye have done it unto me.","Then he shall also say unto those who shall be on the left hand
 Depart from me
 ye cursed
 into eternal fire
 prepared for the devil and his angels;","for I was hungry
 and ye gave me no food; I was thirsty
 and ye gave me no drink;","I was a stranger
 and ye took me not in; naked
 and ye clothed me not; sick and in prison
 and ye visited me not.","Then they shall also answer him
 saying
 Lord
 when did we see thee hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister unto thee?","Then he shall answer them
 saying
 Verily I say unto you
 Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of my brothers
 ye did it not to me.","And they shall go away into eternal punishment
 but the righteous into eternal life.","Ye know that after two days is the passover
 and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.","But Jesus
 understanding this
 said unto them
 Why trouble ye the woman? for she has wrought a good work upon me.","For ye have the poor always with you
 but me ye have not always.","For in that she has poured this ointment on my body
 she did it to prepare for my burial.","Verily I say unto you
 Wherever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world
 there shall also this
 that this woman has done
 be told for a memorial of her.","And he said
 Go into the city to a certain man and say unto him
 The Master saith
 My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.","And as they ate
 he said
 Verily I say unto you that one of you shall betray me.","And he answered and said
 He that dips his hand with me in the dish
 the same shall betray me.","The Son of man goes as it is written of him
 but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! It had been good for that man if he had not been born.","Then Judas
 who was betraying him
 answered and said
 Master
 is it I? He said unto him
 Thou hast said.","And as they were eating
 Jesus took the bread
 and
 having blessed it
 broke it and gave it to the disciples and said
 Take
 eat; this is my body.","And taking the cup and having given thanks
 he gave it to them
 saying
 Drink ye all of it;","for this is my blood of the new testament
 which is shed for many for the remission of sins.","But I say unto you
 I will not drink from now on of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father\u2019s kingdom.","Then Jesus said unto them
 All ye shall be offended because of me this night; for it is written
 I will smite the Shepherd
 and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.","But after I am risen again
 I will go before you into Galilee.","Jesus said unto him
 Verily I say unto thee
 That this night before the cock crows
 thou shalt deny me three times.","Then Jesus came with them unto a place called Gethsemane and said unto the disciples
 Sit ye here
 while I go and pray yonder.","Then he said unto them
 My soul is exceeding sorrowful
 even unto death; tarry ye here and watch with me.","And he went a little further and fell on his face
 praying and saying
 O my Father
 if it be possible
 let this cup pass from me; nevertheless not as I will
 but as thou wilt.","And he came unto the disciples and found them asleep and said unto Peter
 What
 could ye not watch with me one hour?","Watch and pray
 that ye enter not into temptation; the spirit indeed is willing
 but the flesh is weak.","He went away again the second time and prayed
 saying
 O my Father
 if this cup may not pass away from me except I drink it
 thy will be done.","Then he came unto his disciples and said unto them
 Sleep on now and take your rest; behold
 the hour is at hand
 and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.","Rise
 let us be going; behold
 he is at hand that doth betray me.","And Jesus said unto him
 Friend
 why art thou come? Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and took him.","Then Jesus said unto him
 Put up again thy sword into its place
 for all those that take the sword shall perish by the sword.","Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father
 and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?","But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled that thus it must be?","In that same hour Jesus said to the multitude
 Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple
 and ye laid no hold on me.","But all this was done that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him and fled.","Jesus said unto him
 Thou hast said it; nevertheless I say unto you
 Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power and coming in the clouds of heaven.","And Peter remembered the word of Jesus
 who said unto him
 Before the cock crows
 thou shalt deny me three times. And he went out and wept bitterly.","And Jesus stood before the governor
 and the governor asked him
 saying
 Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him
 Thou sayest.","And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice
 saying
 Eli
 Eli
 lama sabachthani? That is to say
 My God
 my God
 why hast thou forsaken me?","And as they went to tell his disciples
 behold
 Jesus met them
 saying
 Receive joy. And they came and held him by the feet and worshipped him.","Then Jesus said unto them
 Be not afraid; go tell my brothers that they may go into Galilee
 and there they shall see me.","And Jesus came and spoke unto them
 saying
 All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.","Go ye therefore and teach all nations
 baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit
","teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you; and
 behold
 I am with you always even unto the end of the age. Amen.","And Jesus answering said unto him
 \u201cSuffer it to be so now
 for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness.\u201d Then John suffered Him.","But He answered and said
 \u201cIt is written: \u2018Man shall not live by bread alone
 but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.\u2019\u201d","Jesus said unto him
 \u201cIt is written again: \u2018Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.\u2019\u201d","Then said Jesus unto him
 \u201cGet thee hence
 Satan! For it is written: \u2018Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God
 and Him only shalt thou serve.\u2019\u201d","From that time Jesus began to preach and to say
 \u201cRepent
 for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.\u201d","And He said unto them
 \u201cFollow Me
 and I will make you fishers of men.\u201d","\u201cBlessed are the poor in spirit
 for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.","Blessed are they that mourn
 for they shall be comforted.","Blessed are the meek
 for they shall inherit the earth.","Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness
 for they shall be filled.","Blessed are the merciful
 for they shall obtain mercy.","Blessed are the pure in heart
 for they shall see God.","Blessed are the peacemakers
 for they shall be called the children of God.","Blessed are they that are persecuted for righteousness\u2019 sake
 for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.","Blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you
 and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for My sake.","Rejoice and be exceeding glad
 for great is your reward in Heaven; for so persecuted they the prophets who were before you.","\u201cYe are the salt of the earth
 but if the salt has lost his savor
 wherewith shall it be salted? It is thenceforth good for nothing
 but to be cast out and to be trodden under foot of men.","\u201cYe are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid.","Neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel
 but on a candlestick
 and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.","Let your light so shine before men
 that they may see your good works
 and glorify your Father who is in Heaven.","\u201cThink not that I am come to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I am not come to destroy
 but to fulfill.","For verily I say unto you
 till heaven and earth pass away
 not one jot or one tittle shall in any wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled.","Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments and shall teach men so
 he shall be called the least in the Kingdom of Heaven; but whosoever shall do and teach them
 the same shall be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven.","For I say unto you that unless your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees
 ye shall in no case enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.","\u201cYe have heard that it was said by them of old
 \u2018Thou shalt not kill
\u2019 and \u2018Whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment.\u2019","But I say unto you
 that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment; and whosoever shall say to his brother
 \u2018Raca
\u2019 shall be in danger of the council; but whosoever shall say
 \u2018Thou fool
\u2019 shall be in danger of hell fire.","Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar and there rememberest that thy brother hath aught against thee
","leave there thy gift before the altar
 and go thy way. First be reconciled to thy brother
 and then come and offer thy gift.","\u201cAgree with thine adversary quickly while thou art on the way with him
 lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge
 and the judge deliver thee to the officer
 and thou be cast into prison.","Verily I say unto thee
 thou shalt by no means come out thence until thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.","\u201cYe have heard that it was said by them of old
 \u2018Thou shalt not commit adultery.\u2019","But I say unto you
 that whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.","And if thy right eye cause thee to fall
 pluck it out and cast it from thee; for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish
 and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.","And if thy right hand cause thee to fall
 cut it off and cast it from thee; for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish
 and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.","\u201cIt hath been said
 \u2018Whosoever shall put away his wife
 let him give her a writing of divorcement.\u2019","But I say unto you
 that whosoever shall put away his wife
 except for the cause of fornication
 causeth her to commit adultery; and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery.","\u201cAgain
 ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old times
 \u2018Thou shalt not forswear thyself
 but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths.\u2019","But I say unto you
 swear not at all: neither by Heaven
 for it is God\u2019s throne;","nor by the earth
 for it is His footstool; neither by Jerusalem
 for it is the city of the great King.","Neither shalt thou swear by thy head
 because thou canst not make one hair white or black.","But let your communication be \u2018yea
 yea\u2019 or \u2018nay
 nay\u2019; for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.","\u201cYe have heard that it hath been said
 \u2018An eye for an eye
 and a tooth for a tooth.\u2019","But I say unto you that ye resist not evil
 but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek
 turn to him the other also.","And if any man will sue thee at the law and take away thy coat
 let him have thy cloak also.","And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile
 go with him two.","Give to him that asketh thee; and from him that would borrow of thee
 turn not thou away.","\u201cYe have heard that it hath been said
 \u2018Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy.\u2019","But I say unto you
 love your enemies
 bless them that curse you
 do good to them that hate you
 and pray for them that despitefully use you and persecute you
","that ye may be the children of your Father who is in Heaven. For He maketh His sun to rise on the evil and on the good
 and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.","For if ye love them that love you
 what reward have ye? Do not even the publicans the same?","And if ye salute your brethren only
 what do ye more than others? Do not even the publicans so?","Be ye therefore perfect
 even as your Father who is in Heaven is perfect.","\u201cTake heed that ye do not your almsgiving before men
 to be seen by them; otherwise ye have no reward from your Father who is in Heaven.","Therefore when thou givest thine alms
 do not sound a trumpet before thee
 as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets
 that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you
 they have their reward.","But when thou givest alms
 let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth
","that thine almsgiving may be in secret; and thy Father who seeth in secret
 Himself shall reward thee openly.","\u201cAnd when thou prayest
 thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are. For they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the corners of the streets
 that they may be seen by men. Verily I say unto you
 they have their reward.","But thou
 when thou prayest
 enter into thy closet
 and when thou hast shut thy door
 pray to thy Father who is in secret; and thy Father who seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.","But when ye pray
 use not vain repetitions as the heathen do
 for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.","Be not ye therefore like unto them
 for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of before ye ask Him.","In this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father who art in Heaven
 hallowed be Thy name.","Thy Kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth
 as it is in Heaven.","Give us this day our daily bread.","And forgive us our debts
 as we forgive our debtors.","And lead us not into temptation
 but deliver us from evil. For Thine is the Kingdom
 and the power and the glory for ever. Amen.","For if ye forgive men their trespasses
 your heavenly Father will also forgive you.","But if ye forgive not men their trespasses
 neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.","\u201cMoreover when ye fast
 be not
 as the hypocrites
 of a sad countenance. For they disfigure their faces
 that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you
 they have their reward.","But thou
 when thou fastest
 anoint thine head and wash thy face
","that thou appear not unto men to fast
 but unto thy Father who is in secret; and thy Father
 who seeth in secret
 shall reward thee openly.","\u201cLay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth
 where moth and rust doth corrupt
 and where thieves break through and steal;","but lay up for yourselves treasures in Heaven
 where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt
 and where thieves do not break through nor steal.","For where your treasure is
 there will your heart be also.","\u201cThe light of the body is the eye. If therefore thine eye be single
 thy whole body shall be full of light.","But if thine eye be evil
 thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness
 how great is that darkness!","\u201cNo man can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other
 or else he will hold to the one and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.","\u201cTherefore I say unto you
 take no thought for your life
 what ye shall eat
 or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body
 what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat
 and the body than raiment?","Behold the fowls of the air
 for they sow not
 neither do they reap
 nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?","\u201cWhich of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?","And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field
 how they grow. They toil not
 neither do they spin
","and yet I say unto you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.","Therefore
 if God so clothe the grass of the field
 which today is
 and tomorrow is cast into the oven
 shall He not much more clothe you
 O ye of little faith?","Therefore take no thought
 saying
 \u2018What shall we eat?\u2019 or \u2018What shall we drink?\u2019 or \u2018Wherewith shall we be clothed?\u2019","(For after all these things do the Gentiles seek.) For your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.","But seek ye first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness
 and all these things shall be added unto you.","\u201cTake therefore no thought for the morrow
 for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.","\u201cJudge not
 that ye be not judged.","For with what judgment ye judge
 ye shall be judged; and with what measure ye mete
 it shall be measured to you again.","And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother\u2019s eye
 but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?","Or how wilt thou say to thy brother
 \u2018Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye
\u2019 and behold
 a beam is in thine own eye?","Thou hypocrite
 first cast out the beam out of thine own eye
 and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother\u2019s eye.","\u201cGive not that which is holy unto the dogs
 neither cast ye your pearls before swine
 lest they trample them under their feet
 and turn again and rend you.","\u201cAsk
 and it shall be given you; seek
 and ye shall find; knock
 and it shall be opened unto you.","For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.","\u201cOr what man is there among you whom
 if his son ask for bread
 will give him a stone?","Or if he ask for a fish
 will give him a serpent?","If ye then
 being evil
 know how to give good gifts unto your children
 how much more shall your Father who is in Heaven give good things to them that ask Him?","Therefore
 all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you
 do ye even so to them; for this is the Law and the Prophets.","\u201cEnter ye in at the strait gate
 for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction
 and many there be who go in thereat.","Because strait is the gate
 and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life
 and few there be that find it.","\u201cBeware of false prophets
 who come to you in sheep\u2019s clothing
 but inwardly they are ravening wolves.","Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes from thorns
 or figs from thistles?","Even so
 every good tree bringeth forth good fruit
 but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.","A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit
 neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.","Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire.","Therefore
 by their fruits ye shall know them.","\u201cNot every one that saith unto Me
 \u2018Lord
 Lord
\u2019 shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven
 but he that doeth the will of My Father who is in Heaven.","Many will say to Me in that Day
 \u2018Lord
 Lord
 have we not prophesied in Thy name
 and in Thy name have cast out devils
 and in Thy name done many wonderful works?\u2019","And then will I profess unto them
 \u2018I never knew you: depart from Me
 ye that work iniquity.\u2019","\u201cTherefore
 whosoever heareth these sayings of Mine and doeth them
 I will liken him unto a wise man
 who built his house upon a rock.","And the rain descended and the floods came
 and the winds blew and beat upon that house; and it fell not
 for it was founded upon a rock.","And every one that heareth these sayings of Mine and doeth them not
 shall be likened unto a foolish man
 who built his house upon the sand;","and the rain descended
 and the floods came
 and the winds blew
 and beat upon that house; and it fell
 and great was the fall of it.\u201d","And Jesus put forth His hand and touched him
 saying
 \u201cI will: be thou clean.\u201d And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.","And Jesus said unto him
 \u201cSee thou tell no man; but go thy way
 show thyself to the priest
 and offer the gift that Moses commanded for a testimony unto them.\u201d","And Jesus said unto him
 \u201cI will come and heal him.\u201d","When Jesus heard it
 He marveled and said to those who followed
 \u201cVerily I say unto you
 I have not found such great faith
 no
 not in Israel.","And I say unto you
 that many shall come from the east and west
 and shall sit down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven.","But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\u201d","And Jesus said unto the centurion
 \u201cGo thy way
 and as thou hast believed
 so be it done unto thee.\u201d And his servant was healed in that selfsame hour.","And Jesus said unto him
 \u201cThe foxes have holes
 and the birds of the air have nests
 but the Son of Man hath nowhere to lay His head.\u201d","But Jesus said unto him
 \u201cFollow Me
 and let the dead bury their dead.\u201d","And He said unto them
 \u201cWhy are ye fearful
 O ye of little faith?\u201d Then He arose and rebuked the winds and the sea
 and there was a great calm.","And He said to them
 \u201cGo.\u201d And when they had come out
 they went into the herd of swine
 and behold
 the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea and perished in the waters.","And behold
 they brought to Him a man sick with the palsy
 lying on a bed. And Jesus
 seeing their faith
 said unto the one sick with the palsy
 \u201cSon
 be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee.\u201d","And Jesus
 knowing their thoughts
 said
 \u201cWhy think ye evil in your hearts?","For which is easier: to say
 \u2018Thy sins be forgiven thee
\u2019 or to say
 \u2018Arise and walk\u2019?","But that ye may know that the Son of Man hath power on earth to forgive sins
\u201d\u2014 (then said He to the one sick with palsy) \u201cArise
 take up thy bed and go unto thine house.\u201d","And as Jesus passed forth from thence
 He saw a man named Matthew
 sitting in the customhouse. And He said unto him
 \u201cFollow Me.\u201d And he arose and followed Him.","But when Jesus heard that
 He said unto them
 \u201cThey that be whole need not a physician
 but they that are sick.","But go ye and learn what this meaneth: \u2018I will have mercy and not sacrifice.\u2019 For I am not come to call the righteous
 but sinners to repentance.\u201d","And Jesus said unto them
 \u201cCan the attendants of the bridechamber mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken from them
 and then shall they fast.","\u201cNo man putteth a piece of new cloth upon an old garment
 for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment
 and the rent is made worse.","Neither do men put new wine into old wineskins
 else the wineskins burst and the wine runneth out and the skins perish. But they put new wine into new wineskins
 and both are preserved.\u201d","But Jesus turned about
 and when He saw her
 He said
 \u201cDaughter
 be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole.\u201d And the woman was made whole from that hour.","He said unto them
 \u201cGive way
 for the maid is not dead
 but sleepeth.\u201d And they laughed Him to scorn.","And when He had come into the house
 the blind men came to Him
 and Jesus said unto them
 \u201cBelieve ye that I am able to do this?\u201d They said unto Him
 \u201cYea
 Lord.\u201d","And their eyes were opened
 and Jesus strictly charged them
 saying
 \u201cSee that no man know it.\u201d","Then said He unto His disciples
 \u201cThe harvest truly is plenteous
 but the laborers are few.","Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest
 that He will send forth laborers into His harvest.\u201d","These twelve Jesus sent forth and commanded them

 preach
 saying
 \u2018The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.\u2019","Heal the sick
 cleanse the lepers

 inquire who in it is worthy

 salute it
","and if the house be worthy
 let your peace come upon it; but if it be not worthy
 let your peace return to you.","And whosoever shall not receive you
 nor hear your words

 it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the Day of Judgment than for that city.","\u201cBehold
 I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves. Be ye therefore wise as serpents and harmless as doves.","But beware of men
 for they will deliver you up to the councils
 and they will scourge you in their synagogues
","and ye shall be brought before governors and kings for My sake
 for a testimony against them and the Gentiles.","But when they deliver you up
 take no thought how or what ye shall speak
 for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak.","For it is not ye that speak
 but the Spirit of your Father who speaketh in you.","And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death
 and the father the child; and the children shall rise up against their parents and cause them to be put to death.","And ye shall be hated by all men for My name\u2019s sake

 flee ye into another; for verily I say unto you
 ye shall not have gone through the cities of Israel till the Son of Man be come.","\u201cThe disciple is not above his master
 nor the servant above his lord.","It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master
 and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub
 how much more shall they call them of his household!","Fear them not therefore
 for there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed
 and hid that shall not be known.","What I tell you in darkness
 that speak ye in light; and what ye hear in the ear
 that preach ye upon the housetops.","And fear not them that kill the body
 but are not able to kill the soul; but rather fear Him that is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.","\u201cAre not two sparrows sold for a farthing? And one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.","But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.","Fear ye not
 therefore; ye are of more value than many sparrows.","\u201cWhosoever therefore shall confess Me before men
 him will I confess also before My Father who is in Heaven.","But whosoever shall deny Me before men
 him will I also deny before My Father who is in Heaven.","\u201cThink not that I am come to send peace on earth. I came not to send peace
 but a sword.","For I am come to \u2018set a man at variance against his father

 \u201cGo and show John again those things which ye hear and see:","the blind receive their sight and the lame walk

 Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John
 \u201cWhat went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?","But what went ye out to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold
 they that wear soft clothing are in kings\u2019 houses.","But what went ye out to see? A prophet? Yea
 I say unto you

 among them that are born of women
 there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist; notwithstanding

 the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence
 and the violent take it by force.","For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John.","And if ye will receive it
 this is Elijah
 who was to come.","He that hath ears to hear
 let him hear.","\u201cBut to what shall I liken this generation? It is like unto children sitting in the markets and calling unto their fellows
","and saying
 \u2018We have piped unto you
 and ye have not danced; we have mourned unto you
 and ye have not lamented.\u2019","For John came neither eating nor drinking
 and they say
 \u2018He hath a devil!\u2019","The Son of Man came eating and drinking
 and they say
 \u2018Behold a gluttonous man and a winebibber
 a friend of publicans and sinners!\u2019 But wisdom is justified by her children.\u201d","Then He began to upbraid the cities wherein most of His mighty works were done
 because they repented not.","\u201cWoe unto thee
 Chorazin! Woe unto thee
 Bethsaida! For if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon
 they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.","But I say unto you
 it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the Day of Judgment than for you.","And thou
 Capernaum
 which art exalted unto heaven
 shalt be brought down to hell; for if the mighty works which have been done in thee had been done in Sodom
 it would have remained until this day.","But I say unto you
 that it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the Day of Judgment than for thee.\u201d","At that time Jesus answered and said
 \u201cI thank Thee
 O Father
 Lord of Heaven and earth
 because Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent
 and hast revealed them unto babes.","Even so
 Father
 for so it seemed good in Thy sight.","\u201cAll things are delivered unto Me by My Father

 and I will give you rest.","Take My yoke upon you and learn of Me
 for I am meek and lowly in heart
 and ye shall find rest unto your souls.","For My yoke is easy
 and My burden is light.\u201d","But He said unto them
 \u201cHave ye not read what David did when he hungered and they that were with him:","how he entered into the house of God and ate the showbread
 which was not lawful for him to eat
 neither for those who were with him
 but only for the priests?","Or have ye not read in the law how on the Sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are blameless?","But I say unto you
 that in this place is One greater than the temple.","But if ye had known what this meaneth
 \u2018I will have mercy and not sacrifice
\u2019 ye would not have condemned the guiltless.","For the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath day.\u201d","And He said unto them
 \u201cWhat man shall there be among you that shall have one sheep
 and if it fall into a pit on the Sabbath day
 will not lay hold on it and lift it out?","How much then is a man better than a sheep? Therefore it is lawful to do well on the Sabbath days.\u201d","Then He said to the man
 \u201cStretch forth thine hand.\u201d And he stretched it forth
 and it was restored whole like the other.","And Jesus knew their thoughts and said unto them
 \u201cEvery kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation
 and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand.","And if Satan cast out Satan
 he is divided against himself; how then shall his kingdom stand?","And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils
 by whom do your children cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges.","But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God
 then the Kingdom of God is come unto you.","Or else how can one enter into a strong man\u2019s house and despoil his goods
 unless he first bind the strong man? And then he will despoil his house.","\u201cHe that is not with Me is against Me
 and he that gathereth not with Me scattereth abroad.","Therefore I say unto you
 all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men
 but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.","And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of Man
 it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost
 it shall not be forgiven him
 neither in this world
 neither in the world to come.","Either make the tree good and his fruit good
 or else make the tree corrupt and his fruit corrupt; for the tree is known by his fruit.","\u201cO generation of vipers
 how can ye
 being evil
 speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.","A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things; and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.","But I say unto you that every idle word that men shall speak
 they shall give account thereof in the Day of Judgment.","For by thy words thou shalt be justified
 and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.\u201d","But He answered and said unto them
 \u201cAn evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign
 and there shall no sign be given to it
 but the sign of the prophet Jonah.","For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the whale\u2019s belly
 so shall the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.","The men of Nineveh shall rise in the Judgment with this generation and shall condemn it
 because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold
 a greater than Jonah is here.","The queen of the south shall rise up in the Judgment with this generation and shall condemn it
 for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold
 a greater than Solomon is here.","\u201cWhen the unclean spirit is gone out of a man
 he walketh through dry places
 seeking rest
 and findeth none.","Then he saith
 \u2018I will return into my house from whence I came out.\u2019 And when he is come
 he findeth it empty
 swept
 and garnished.","Then goeth he
 and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself
 and they enter in and dwell there; and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation.\u201d","While He yet talked to the people
 behold
 His mother and His brethren stood outside
 desiring to speak with Him.","But He answered and said unto him that told Him
 \u201cWho is My mother? And who are My brethren?\u201d","And He stretched forth His hand toward His disciples and said
 \u201cBehold
 My mother and My brethren!","For whosoever shall do the will of My Father who is in Heaven
 the same is My brother
 and sister
 and mother.\u201d","And He spoke many things unto them in parables
 saying
 \u201cBehold
 a sower went forth to sow.","And when he sowed
 some seeds fell by the wayside; and the fowls came and devoured them up.","Some fell upon stony places where they had not much earth; and forthwith they sprang up
 because they had no deepness of earth.","And when the sun was up they were scorched
 and because they had no root they withered away.","And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up and choked them.","But others fell into good ground and brought forth fruit
 some a hundredfold
 some sixtyfold
 some thirtyfold.","Who hath ears to hear
 let him hear.\u201d","He answered and said unto them
 \u201cBecause it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven
 but to them it is not given.","For whosoever hath
 to him shall be given
 and he shall have more abundance. But whosoever hath not
 from him shall be taken away even that which he hath.","Therefore speak I to them in parables
 because seeing
 they see not
 and hearing
 they hear not
 neither do they understand.","And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah
 which saith
 \u2018By hearing ye shall hear
 and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see
 and shall not perceive.","For this people\u2019s heart has waxed gross
 and their ears are dull of hearing
 and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with their eyes
 and hear with their ears
 and should understand with their heart
 and should be converted
 and I should heal them.\u2019","But blessed are your eyes
 for they see; and your ears
 for they hear.","For verily I say unto you
 that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see
 and have not seen them
 and to hear those things which ye hear
 and have not heard them.","\u201cHear ye therefore the parable of the sower:","When any one heareth the Word of the Kingdom and understandeth it not
 then cometh the wicked one and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he that received seed by the wayside.","But he that received the seed into stony places
 the same is he that heareth the Word and at once with joy receiveth it;","yet hath he not root in himself
 but endureth for a while. For when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the Word
 by and by he loses faith.","He also that received the seed among the thorns is he that heareth the Word; and the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the Word
 and he becometh unfruitful.","But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the Word and understandeth it; who also beareth fruit and bringeth forth
 some a hundredfold
 some sixty
 some thirty.\u201d","Another parable put He forth before them
 saying
 \u201cThe Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto a man who sowed good seed in his field;","but while men slept
 his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat
 and went his way.","But when the blades had sprung up and brought forth fruit
 then appeared the tares also.","So the servants of the householder came and said unto him
 \u2018Sir
 didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? From whence then hath come the tares?\u2019","He said unto them
 \u2018An enemy hath done this.\u2019 The servants said unto him
 \u2018Wilt thou then have us go and gather them up?\u2019","But he said
 \u2018Nay
 lest while ye gather up the tares
 ye root up also the wheat with them.","Let both grow together until the harvest
 and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers
 \u201cGather ye together first the tares
 and bind them in bundles to burn them
 but gather the wheat into my barn.\u201d\u2019\u201d","Another parable put He forth before them
 saying
 \u201cThe Kingdom of Heaven is like a grain of mustard seed
 which a man took and sowed in his field
","which indeed is the least of all seeds; but when it is grown it is the greatest among herbs and becometh a tree
 so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.\u201d","Another parable spoke He unto them: \u201cThe Kingdom of Heaven is like unto leaven
 which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal till the whole was leavened.\u201d","He answered and said unto them
 \u201cHe that soweth the good seed is the Son of Man.","The field is the world
 the good seed are the children of the Kingdom
 but the tares are the children of the wicked one.","The enemy that sowed them is the devil
 the harvest is the end of the world
 and the reapers are the angels.","As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire
 so shall it be at the end of this world.","The Son of Man shall send forth His angels
 and they shall gather out of His Kingdom all things that offend and them that do iniquity
","and shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.","Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the Kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear
 let him hear.","\u201cAgain
 the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field
 which
 when a man hath found
 he hideth; and for the joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath
 and buyeth that field.","\u201cAgain
 the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a merchant man
 seeking goodly pearls
","who
 when he had found one pearl of great price
 went and sold all that he had and bought it.","\u201cAgain
 the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a net that was cast into the sea
 and gathered of every kind
","which
 when it was full
 they drew to shore
 and sat down and gathered the good into vessels
 but cast the bad away.","So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth and sever the wicked from among the just
","and shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.\u201d","Jesus said unto them
 \u201cHave ye understood all these things?\u201d They said unto Him
 \u201cYea
 Lord.\u201d","Then said He unto them
 \u201cTherefore every scribe who is instructed unto the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a man that is a householder
 who bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old.\u201d","And they were offended at Him. But Jesus said unto them
 \u201cA prophet is not without honor
 save in his own country and in his own house.\u201d","But Jesus said unto them
 \u201cThey need not depart. Give ye them to eat.\u201d","And He said
 \u201cBring them hither to Me.\u201d","But straightway Jesus spoke unto them
 saying
 \u201cBe of good cheer. It is I; be not afraid.\u201d","And He said
 \u201cCome.\u201d And when Peter had come down out of the boat
 he walked on the water to go to Jesus.","And immediately Jesus stretched forth His hand and caught him and said unto him
 \u201cO thou of little faith
 why didst thou doubt?\u201d","But He answered and said unto them
 \u201cWhy do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?","For God commanded
 saying
 \u2018Honor thy father and mother
\u2019 and
 \u2018He that curseth father or mother
 let him die the death.\u2019","But ye say that whosoever shall say to his father or his mother
 \u2018by whatsoever thou might have profited by me
 it is a gift
\u2019","and honor not his father or his mother
 he shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of no effect by your tradition.","Ye hypocrites
 well did Isaiah prophesy of you
 saying
","\u2018This people draweth nigh unto Me with their mouth
 and honoreth Me with their lips
 but their heart is far from Me.","But in vain they do worship Me
 teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.\u2019\u201d","And He called the multitude and said unto them
 \u201cHear and understand:","Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man
 but that which cometh out of the mouth
 this defileth a man.\u201d","But He answered and said
 \u201cEvery plant which My heavenly Father hath not planted shall be rooted up.","Let them alone; they are blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind
 both shall fall into the ditch.\u201d","And Jesus said
 \u201cAre ye also yet without understanding?","Do ye not yet understand that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly
 and is cast out into the drain?","But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart
 and they defile the man.","For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts
 murders
 adulteries
 fornications
 thefts
 false witness
 blasphemies:","these are the things which defile a man. But to eat with unwashed hands defileth not a man.\u201d","But He answered and said
 \u201cI am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\u201d","But He answered and said
 \u201cIt is not meet to take children\u2019s bread and cast it to dogs.\u201d","Then Jesus answered and said unto her
 \u201cO woman

 \u201cI have compassion on the multitude
 because they continue with Me now three days and have had nothing to eat; and I will not send them away fasting
 lest they faint on the way.\u201d","And Jesus said unto them
 \u201cHow many loaves have ye?\u201d And they said
 \u201cSeven
 and a few little fishes.\u201d","He answered and said unto them
 \u201cWhen it is evening ye say
 \u2018It will be fair weather

 \u2018It will be foul weather today
 for the sky is red and lowering.\u2019 O ye hypocrites

 but can ye not discern the signs of the times?","A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign
 and there shall no sign be given unto it
 but the sign of the prophet Jonah.\u201d And He left them and departed.","Then Jesus said unto them
 \u201cTake heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.\u201d","But when Jesus perceived this
 He said unto them
 \u201cO ye of little faith

 \u2018because ye have brought no bread\u2019?","Do ye not yet understand
 neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand
 and how many baskets ye took up?","Nor the seven loaves of the four thousand
 and how many baskets ye took up?","How is it that ye do not understand that I spoke it not to you concerning bread
 but that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees?\u201d","When Jesus came into the region of Caesarea Philippi
 He asked His disciples
 saying
 \u201cWho do men say that I

 that thou art Peter

 \u201cGet thee behind Me
 Satan! Thou art an offense unto Me; for thou savorest not the things that be of God

 \u201cIf any man will come after Me
 let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me.","For whosoever will save his life shall lose it
 and whosoever will lose his life for My sake shall find it.","For what is a man profited
 if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?","For the Son of Man shall come in the glory of His Father with His angels
 and then He shall reward every man according to his works.","Verily I say unto you
 there are some standing here who shall not taste of death till they see the Son of Man coming in His Kingdom.\u201d","And Jesus came and touched them and said
 \u201cArise
 and be not afraid.\u201d","And as they came down from the mountain

 the same is greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven.","And whoso shall receive one such little child in My name
 receiveth Me.","But whoso shall cause one of these little ones who believe in Me to fall
 it were better for him that a millstone were hung about his neck
 and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.","\u201cWoe unto the world because of offenses! For it must happen that offenses come
 but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh.","Therefore if thy hand or thy foot cause thee to fall
 cut them off and cast them from thee; it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed
 rather than having two hands or two feet
 to be cast into everlasting fire.","And if thine eye cause thee to fall
 pluck it out and cast it from thee; it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye
 rather than having two eyes
 to be cast into hell fire.","\u201cTake heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you that in Heaven their angels do always behold the face of My Father who is in Heaven.","How think ye? If a man have a hundred sheep and one of them be gone astray
 doth he not leave the ninety and nine
 and goeth into the mountains and seeketh that which is gone astray?","And if it so be that he find it
 verily I say unto you
 he rejoiceth more over that sheep than over the ninety and nine which went not astray.","Even so it is not the will of your Father who is in Heaven that one of these little ones should perish.","\u201cMoreover
 if thy brother shall trespass against thee
 go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone. If he shall hear thee
 thou hast gained thy brother.","But if he will not hear thee
 then take with thee one or two more
 that \u2018in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.\u2019","And if he shall neglect to hear them
 tell it unto the church; but if he neglect to hear the church
 let him be unto thee as a heathen man and a publican.","Verily I say unto you
 whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in Heaven; and so whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in Heaven.","\u201cAgain I say unto you
 that if two of you shall agree on earth concerning anything that they shall ask
 it shall be done for them by My Father who is in Heaven.","For where two or three are gathered together in My name
 there am I in the midst of them.\u201d","And Jesus said unto him
 \u201cI say not unto thee
 until seven times
 but until seventy times seven.","\u201cTherefore is the Kingdom of Heaven likened unto a certain king who would settle accounts with his servants.","And when he had begun to reckon
 one was brought unto him who owed him ten thousand talents.","But inasmuch as he could not pay
 his lord commanded him to be sold
 and his wife and children and all that he had
 and payment to be made.","The servant therefore fell down and did homage to him
 saying
\u2018Lord
 have patience with me
 and I will pay thee all.\u2019","Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion
 and loosed him and forgave him the debt.","But the same servant went out and found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred pence. And he laid hands on him
 and took him by the throat
 saying
 \u2018Pay me what thou owest.\u2019","And his fellow servant fell down at his feet
 and besought him
 saying
 \u2018Have patience with me
 and I will pay thee all.\u2019","And he would not
 but went and cast him into prison till he should pay the debt.","So when his fellow servants saw what was done
 they were very sorry and came and told unto their lord all that was done.","Then his lord
 after he had called him
 said unto him
 \u2018O thou wicked servant
 I forgave thee all that debt
 because thou desiredst me.","Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellow servant
 even as I had pity on thee?\u2019","And his lord was wroth
 and delivered him to the tormentors till he should pay all that was due unto him.","So likewise shall My heavenly Father do also unto you
 if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother\u2019s trespasses.\u201d","And He answered and said unto them
 \u201cHave ye not read
 that He that made them at the beginning made them male and female
","and said
 \u2018For this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife
 and the two shall be one flesh\u2019?","Therefore they are no more two
 but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together
 let not man put asunder.\u201d","He said unto them
 \u201cMoses
 because of the hardness of your hearts
 suffered you to put away your wives
 but from the beginning it was not so.","And I say unto you
 whosoever shall put away his wife
 except it be for fornication
 and shall marry another
 committeth adultery; and whoso marrieth her who is put away doth commit adultery.\u201d","But He said unto them
 \u201cAll men cannot receive this saying
 save they to whom it is given.","For there are some eunuchs who were so born from their mother\u2019s womb
 and there are some eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men
 and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven\u2019s sake. He that is able to receive it
 let him receive it.\u201d","but Jesus said
 \u201cSuffer little children
 and forbid them not to come unto Me
for of such is the Kingdom of Heaven.\u201d","And He said unto him
 \u201cWhy callest thou Me good? There is none good but One
 that is
 God. But if thou wilt enter into Life
 keep the commandments.\u201d","He said unto Him
 \u201cWhich?\u201d Jesus said
 \u201c\u2018Thou shalt do no murder; thou shalt not commit adultery; thou shalt not steal; thou shalt not bear false witness;","honor thy father and thy mother; and
 thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.\u2019\u201d","Jesus said unto him
 \u201cIf thou wilt be perfect
 go and sell what thou hast and give to the poor
 and thou shalt have treasure in Heaven; and come and follow Me.\u201d","Then said Jesus unto His disciples
 \u201cVerily I say unto you
 that a rich man shall hardly enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.","And again I say unto you
 it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle
 than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God.\u201d","But Jesus beheld them and said unto them
 \u201cWith men this is impossible
 but with God all things are possible.\u201d","And Jesus said unto them
 \u201cVerily I say unto you
 that ye that have followed Me
 in the regeneration when the Son of Man shall sit on the throne of His glory
 ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones
 judging the twelve tribes of Israel.","And everyone that hath forsaken houses or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands
 for My name\u2019s sake
 shall receive a hundredfold and shall inherit everlasting life.","But many that are first shall be last
 and the last shall be first.","\u201cFor the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a man that is a householder
 who went out early in the morning to hire laborers into his vineyard.","And when he had agreed with the laborers for a penny a day
 he sent them into his vineyard.","And he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the marketplace
","and said unto them
 \u2018Go ye also into the vineyard
 and whatsoever is right I will give you.\u2019 And they went their way.","Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour and did likewise.","And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing idle
 and said unto them
 \u2018Why stand ye here all the day idle?\u2019","They said unto him
 \u2018Because no man hath hired us.\u2019 He said unto them
 \u2018Go ye also into the vineyard
 and whatsoever is right
 that shall ye receive.\u2019","So when evening had come
 the lord of the vineyard said unto his steward
 \u2018Call the laborers and give them their hire
 beginning from the last unto the first.\u2019","And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour
 they received every man a penny.","But when the first came
 they supposed they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny.","And when they had received it
 they murmured against the master of the house
","saying
 \u2018These last have wrought but one hour
 and thou hast made them equal unto us who have borne the burden and the heat of the day.\u2019","But he answered one of them and said
 \u2018Friend
 I do thee no wrong. Didst thou not agree with me for a penny?","Take that which is thine and go thy way. I will give unto this last
 even as unto thee.","Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil
 because I am good?\u2019","So the last shall be first
 and the first last. For many are called
 but few are chosen.\u201d","\u201cBehold
 we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of Man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes
 and they shall condemn Him to death
","and shall deliver Him to the Gentiles to mock and to scourge and to crucify Him. And the third day
 He shall rise again.\u201d","And He said unto her
 \u201cWhat wilt thou?\u201d She said unto Him
 \u201cGrant that these my two sons may sit
 the one on Thy right hand and the other on the left in Thy Kingdom.\u201d","But Jesus answered and said
 \u201cYe know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of
 and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?\u201d They said unto Him
 \u201cWe are able.\u201d","But Jesus called them unto Him and said
 \u201cYe know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them
 and they that are great exercise authority upon them.","But it shall not be so among you; but whosoever will be great among you
 let him be your minister;","and whosoever will be chief among you
 let him be your servant
","even as the Son of Man came not to be ministered unto
 but to minister
 and to give His life as a ransom for many.\u201d","And Jesus stood still
 and called them and said
 \u201cWhat will ye that I shall do unto you?\u201d","saying unto them
 \u201cGo into the village opposite you
 and straightway ye shall find an ass tied
 and a colt with her. Loose them and bring them unto Me.","And if any man say aught unto you
 ye shall say
 \u2018The Lord hath need of them
\u2019 and straightway he will send them.\u201d","and said unto them
 \u201cIt is written
 \u2018My house shall be called the house of prayer
\u2019 but ye have made it a den of thieves.\u201d","and said unto Him
 \u201cHearest thou what these say?\u201d And Jesus said unto them
 \u201cYea
 have ye never read
 \u2018Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings Thou hast perfected praise\u2019?\u201d","And when He saw a fig tree by the wayside
 He came to it and found nothing thereon
 but leaves only. And He said unto it
 \u201cLet no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever.\u201d And immediately the fig tree withered away.","Jesus answered and said unto them
 \u201cVerily I say unto you
 if ye have faith and doubt not
 ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree
 but also if ye shall say unto this mountain
 \u2018Be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea
\u2019 it shall be done.","And all things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer
 believing
 ye shall receive.\u201d","And Jesus answered and said unto them
 \u201cI also will ask you one thing
 which if ye tell Me
 I in like manner will tell you by what authority I do these things.","The baptism of John: whence was it? From Heaven
 or of men?\u201d And they reasoned among themselves
 saying
 \u201cIf we shall say
 \u2018From Heaven
\u2019 he will say unto us
 \u2018Why did ye not then believe him?\u2019","And they answered Jesus and said
 \u201cWe cannot tell.\u201d And He said unto them
 \u201cNeither tell I you by what authority I do these things.","\u201cBut what think ye? A certain man had two sons. And he came to the first and said
 \u2018Son
 go work today in my vineyard.\u2019","He answered and said
 \u2018I will not
\u2019 but afterward he repented and went.","And he came to the second and said likewise. And he answered and said
 \u2018I go
 sir
\u2019 and went not.","Which of those two did the will of his father?\u201d They said unto Him
 \u201cThe first.\u201d Jesus said unto them
 \u201cVerily I say unto you
 that the publicans and the harlots go into the Kingdom of God before you.","For John came unto you in the way of righteousness
 and ye believed him not; but the publicans and harlots believed him. And ye
 when ye had seen it
 repented not afterward
 that ye might believe him.","\u201cHear another parable: There was a certain householder who planted a vineyard
 and hedged it round about
 and dug a wine press in it
 and built a tower
 and let it out to husbandmen and went into a far country.","And when the time of the fruit drew near
 he sent his servants to the husbandmen
 that they might receive the fruits of it.","And the husbandmen took his servants
 and beat one and killed another and stoned another.","Again
 he sent other servants
 more than the first; and they did unto them likewise.","But last of all he sent unto them his son
 saying
 \u2018They will reverence my son.\u2019","But when the husbandmen saw the son
 they said among themselves
 \u2018This is the heir. Come
 let us kill him
 and let us seize on his inheritance.\u2019","And they caught him and cast him out of the vineyard and slew him.","When therefore the lord of the vineyard cometh
 what will he do unto those husbandmen?\u201d","They said unto Him
 \u201cHe will miserably destroy those wicked men
 and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen
 who shall render him the fruits in their seasons.\u201d","Jesus said unto them
 \u201cDid ye never read in the Scriptures: \u2018The stone which the builders rejected
 the same is become the head of the corner. This is the Lord\u2019s doing
 and it is marvelous in our eyes\u2019?","Therefore say I unto you
 the Kingdom of God shall be taken from you and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.","And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall
 it will grind him to powder.\u201d","\u201cThe Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a certain king
 who made a marriage for his son.","And he sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding
 and they would not come.","Again he sent forth other servants
 saying
 \u2018Tell them that are bidden
 \u201cBehold
 I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and my fatlings are killed
 and all things are ready. Come unto the marriage.\u201d\u2019","But they made light of it and went their ways
 one to his farm
 and another to his merchandise
","and the remnant took his servants and treated them spitefully and slew them.","But when the king heard thereof he was wroth
 and he sent forth his armies and destroyed those murderers and burned up their city.","Then said he to his servants
 \u2018The wedding is ready
 but they that were bidden were not worthy.","Go ye therefore into the highways
 and as many as ye shall find
 bid to the marriage.\u2019","So those servants went out into the highways
 and gathered all together as many as they found
 both bad and good
 and the wedding was furnished with guests.","And when the king came in to see the guests
 he saw there a man who did not have on a wedding garment.","And he said unto him
 \u2018Friend
 how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment?\u2019 And he was speechless.","Then said the king to the servants
 \u2018Bind him hand and foot and take him away
 and cast him into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\u2019","For many are called
 but few are chosen.\u201d","But Jesus perceived their wickedness and said
 \u201cWhy tempt ye Me
 ye hypocrites?","Show Me the tribute money.\u201d And they brought unto Him a penny.","And He said unto them
 \u201cWhose is this image and superscription?\u201d","And they said unto Him
 \u201cCaesar\u2019s.\u201d Then said He unto them
 \u201cRender therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar\u2019s
 and unto God the things that are God\u2019s.\u201d","Jesus answered and said unto them
 \u201cYe do err
 not knowing the Scriptures
 nor the power of God.","For in the resurrection they neither marry
 nor are given in marriage
 but are as the angels of God in Heaven.","But concerning the resurrection of the dead
 have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God
 saying
","\u2018I am the God of Abraham
 and the God of Isaac
 and the God of Jacob\u2019? God is not the God of the dead
 but of the living.\u201d","Jesus said unto him
 \u201c\u2018Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart
 and with all thy soul
 and with all thy mind.\u2019","This is the first and great commandment.","And the second is like unto it: \u2018Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.\u2019","On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets.\u201d","saying
 \u201cWhat think ye of Christ? Whose Son is He?\u201d They said unto Him
 \u201cThe son of David.\u201d","He said unto them
 \u201cHow then doth David in the Spirit call Him \u2018Lord
\u2019 saying
","\u2018The Lord said unto my Lord
 \u201cSit Thou on My right hand until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool\u201d\u2019?","If David then call Him \u2018Lord
\u2019 how is He his son?\u201d","saying
 \u201cThe scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses\u2019 seat.","All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe
 that observe and do; but do ye not according to their works; for they say
 and do not.","For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne
 and lay them on men\u2019s shoulders
 but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers.","But all their works they do to be seen by men. They make broad their phylacteries
 and enlarge the borders of their garments
","and love the uppermost places at feasts and the chief seats in the synagogues
","and greetings in the markets
 and to be called by men
 \u2018Rabbi
 Rabbi.\u2019","But be not ye called \u2018Rabbi
\u2019 for One is your Master
 even Christ; and all ye are brethren.","\u201cAnd call no man your father upon earth
 for One is your Father
 who is in Heaven.","Neither be ye called masters

 even Christ.","But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.","And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased
 and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted.","\u201cBut woe unto you
 scribes and Pharisees
 hypocrites! For ye shut up the Kingdom of Heaven against men
 for ye neither go in yourselves
 neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.","\u201cWoe unto you
 scribes and Pharisees
 hypocrites! For ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte
 and when he is made
 ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.","\u201cWoe unto you
 ye blind guides
 who say
 \u2018Whosoever shall swear by the temple
 it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple
 he is obligated.\u2019","Ye fools and blind! For which is greater
 the gold
 or the temple that sanctifieth the gold?","And ye say
 \u2018Whosoever shall swear by the altar
 it is nothing; but whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it
 he is liable.\u2019","Ye fools and blind! For which is greater
 the gift
 or the altar that sanctifieth the gift?","Whoso therefore shall swear by the altar
 sweareth by it and by all things thereon.","And whoso shall swear by the temple
 sweareth by it and by Him that dwelleth therein.","And he that shall swear by Heaven
 sweareth by the throne of God and by Him that sitteth thereon.","\u201cWoe unto you
 scribes and Pharisees
 hypocrites! For ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin
 and have omitted the weightier matters of the law: judgment
 mercy
 and faith. These ought ye to have done and not to leave the other undone.","Ye blind guides
 who strain out a gnat and swallow a camel!","\u201cWoe unto you
 scribes and Pharisees
 hypocrites! For ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter
 but within they are full of extortion and excess.","Thou blind Pharisee
 cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter
 that the outside of them may be clean also.","\u201cWoe unto you
 scribes and Pharisees
 hypocrites! For ye are like unto whited sepulchers
 which indeed appear beautiful outwardly
 but are within full of dead men\u2019s bones and of all uncleanness.","Even so
 ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men
 but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.","\u201cWoe unto you
 scribes and Pharisees
 hypocrites! Because ye build the tombs of the prophets and garnish the sepulchers of the righteous
","and say
 \u2018If we had been in the days of our fathers
 we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.\u2019","Therefore ye are witnesses against yourselves
 that ye are the children of them that killed the prophets.","Fill ye up
 then
 the measure of your fathers.","\u201cYe serpents
 ye generation of vipers! How can ye escape the damnation of hell?","Therefore
 behold
 I send unto you prophets and wise men and scribes

 from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zechariah
 son of Barachias

 all these things shall come upon this generation.","\u201cO Jerusalem

 the love of many shall wax cold.","But he that shall endure unto the end
 the same shall be saved.","And this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations

 spoken of by Daniel the prophet
 standing in the holy place (whoso readeth
 let him understand)

 and to them that give suck in those days!","But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter
 neither on the Sabbath day.","For then shall be great tribulation
 such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time
 no
 nor ever shall be.","And unless those days should be shortened

 I have told you before.","Therefore
 if they shall say unto you
 \u2018Behold
 He is in the desert!\u2019 go not forth; or \u2018Behold
 He is in the secret chambers!\u2019 believe it not.","For as the lightning cometh out of the east and shineth even unto the west
 so shall also the coming of the Son of Man be.","For wheresoever the carcass is
 there will the eagles be gathered together.","\u201cImmediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened and the moon shall not give her light
 and the stars shall fall from heaven and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken
","and then shall appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven. And then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn
 and they shall see the Son of Man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and with great glory.","And He shall send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet

 this generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled.","Heaven and earth shall pass away

 knoweth no man
 no

 and made them another five talents.","And likewise he that had received two
 he also gained another two.","But he that had received one went and dug in the earth and hid his lord\u2019s money.","After a long time the lord of those servants came and reckoned with them.","And so he that had received five talents came and brought the other five talents
 saying
 \u2018Lord
 thou deliveredst unto me five talents. Behold
 I have gained beside them five talents more.\u2019","His lord said unto him
 \u2018Well done
 thou good and faithful servant. Thou hast been faithful over a few things; I will make thee ruler over many things. Enter thou into the joy of thy lord.\u2019","\u201cHe also that had received two talents came and said
 \u2018Lord
 thou deliveredst unto me two talents; behold
 I have gained two other talents beside them.\u2019","His lord said unto him
 \u2018Well done
 good and faithful servant. Thou hast been faithful over a few things; I will make thee ruler over many things. Enter thou into the joy of thy lord.\u2019","\u201cThen he that had received the one talent came and said
 \u2018Lord
 I knew thee
 that thou art a hard man
 reaping where thou hast not sown
 and gathering where thou hast not strewed.","And I was afraid
 and went and hid thy talent in the earth. Lo
 there thou hast what is thine.\u2019","His lord answered and said unto him
 \u2018Thou wicked and slothful servant
 thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not
 and gather where I have not strewed.","Thou ought therefore to have placed my money with the exchangers
 and then at my coming I should have received mine own with interest.","Take therefore the talent from him
 and give it unto him that hath ten talents.","For unto every one that hath shall be given
 and he shall have abundance; but from him that hath not
 shall be taken away even that which he hath.","And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\u2019","\u201cWhen the Son of Man shall come in His glory and all the holy angels with Him
 then shall He sit upon the throne of His glory.","And before Him shall be gathered all nations
 and He shall separate them one from another as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats.","And He shall set the sheep on His right hand
 but the goats on the left.","Then shall the King say unto them on His right hand
 \u2018Come
 ye blessed of My Father
 inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.","For I hungered
 and ye gave Me meat; I was thirsty
 and ye gave Me drink; I was a stranger
 and ye took Me in;","naked
 and ye clothed Me; I was sick
 and ye visited Me; I was in prison
 and ye came unto Me.\u2019","Then shall the righteous answer Him
 saying
 \u2018Lord
 when saw we Thee hungering and fed Thee
 or thirsty and gave Thee drink?","When saw we Thee a stranger and took Thee in
 or naked and clothed Thee?","Or when saw we Thee sick
 or in prison
 and came unto Thee?\u2019","And the King shall answer and say unto them
 \u2018Verily I say unto you
 inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these My brethren
 ye have done it unto Me.\u2019","\u201cThen shall He say also unto them on the left hand
 \u2018Depart from Me
 ye cursed
 into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels.","For I hungered
 and ye gave Me no meat; I was thirsty
 and ye gave Me no drink;","I was a stranger
 and ye took Me not in; naked
 and ye clothed Me not; sick and in prison
 and ye visited Me not.\u2019","Then shall they also answer Him
 saying
 \u2018Lord
 when saw we Thee hungering or athirst or a stranger
 or naked or sick or in prison
 and did not minister unto Thee?\u2019","Then shall He answer them
 saying
 \u2018Verily I say unto you
 inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these
 ye did it not to Me.\u2019","And these shall go away into everlasting punishment
 but the righteous into life eternal.\u201d","\u201cYe know that after two days is the Feast of the Passover
 and the Son of Man is betrayed to be crucified.\u201d","When Jesus perceived this
 He said unto them
 \u201cWhy trouble ye the woman? For she hath wrought a good work upon Me.","For ye have the poor always with you
 but Me ye have not always.","For in that she hath poured this ointment on My body
 she did it for My burial.","Verily I say unto you
 wheresoever this Gospel shall be preached in the whole world
 there shall also this
 which this woman hath done
 be told as a memorial of her.\u201d","And He said
 \u201cGo into the city to a certain man and say unto him
 \u2018The Master saith
 \u201cMy time is at hand; I will keep the Passover at thy house with My disciples.\u201d\u2019\u201d","And as they ate
 He said
 \u201cVerily I say unto you
 that one of you shall betray Me.\u201d","And He answered and said
 \u201cHe that dippeth his hand with Me in the dish
 the same shall betray Me.","The Son of Man goeth as it is written of Him
 but woe unto that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It had been good for that man if he had not been born.\u201d","Then Judas
 who betrayed Him
 answered and said
 \u201cMaster
 is it I?\u201d He said unto him
 \u201cThou hast said.\u201d","And as they were eating
 Jesus took bread and blessed it and broke it
 and gave it to the disciples and said
 \u201cTake
 eat; this is My body.\u201d","And He took the cup and gave thanks
 and gave it to them
 saying
 \u201cDrink ye all of it;","for this is My blood of the new testament
 which is shed for many for the remission of sins.","But I say unto you
 I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in My Father\u2019s Kingdom.\u201d","Then Jesus said unto them
 \u201cAll ye shall be offended because of Me this night; for it is written: \u2018I will smite the Shepherd
 and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.\u2019","But after I am risen again
 I will go before you into Galilee.\u201d","Jesus said unto him
 \u201cVerily I say unto thee
 that this night before the cock crow
 thou shalt deny Me thrice.\u201d","Then Jesus came with them unto a place called Gethsemane
 and said unto the disciples
 \u201cSit ye here while I go and pray yonder.\u201d","Then He said unto them
 \u201cMy soul is exceeding sorrowful
 even unto death; tarry ye here and watch with Me.\u201d","And He went a little farther
 and fell on His face and prayed
 saying
 \u201cO My Father
 if it be possible
 let this cup pass from Me; nevertheless
 not as I will
 but as Thou wilt.\u201d","And He came unto the disciples and found them asleep
 and said unto Peter
 \u201cWhat
 could ye not watch with Me one hour?","Watch and pray
 that ye enter not into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing
 but the flesh is weak.\u201d","He went away again the second time and prayed
 saying
 \u201cO My Father
 if this cup may not pass away from Me
 unless I drink it
 Thy will be done.\u201d","Then came He to His disciples and said unto them
 \u201cSleep on now
 and take your rest. Behold
 the hour is at hand
 and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.","Rise
 let us be going. Behold
 he is at hand that doth betray Me.\u201d","And Jesus said unto him
 \u201cFriend
 why art thou come?\u201d Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and took Him.","Then said Jesus unto him
 \u201cPut up again thy sword into his place
 for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.","Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to My Father
 and He shall at once give Me more than twelve legions of angels?","But how then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled
 that thus it must be?\u201d","In that same hour Jesus said to the multitudes
 \u201cAre ye come out as against a thief
 with swords and staves to take Me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple
 and ye laid no hold on Me.","But all this was done that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.\u201d Then all the disciples forsook Him and fled.","Jesus said unto him
 \u201cThou hast said; nevertheless I say unto you
 hereafter shall ye see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power
 and coming in the clouds of heaven.\u201d","And Peter remembered the word of Jesus
 when He said unto him
 \u201cBefore the cock crow
 thou shalt deny Me thrice.\u201d And he went out and wept bitterly.","And Jesus stood before the governor
 and the governor asked Him
 saying
 \u201cArt thou the King of the Jews?\u201d And Jesus said unto him
 \u201cThou sayest.\u201d","And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice
 saying
 \u201cEli
 Eli
 lama sabachthani?\u201d that is to say
 \u201cMy God
 My God
 why hast Thou forsaken Me?\u201d","And as they went to tell His disciples
 behold
 Jesus met them
 saying
 \u201cAll hail.\u201d And they came
 and held Him by the feet
 and worshiped Him.","Then said Jesus unto them
 \u201cBe not afraid. Go tell My brethren to go into Galilee
 and there shall they see Me.\u201d","And Jesus came and spoke unto them
 saying
 \u201cAll power is given unto Me in Heaven and on earth.","Go ye therefore and teach all nations
 baptizing them in the name of the Father
 and of the Son
 and of the Holy Ghost
","teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you. And lo
 I am with you always
 even unto the end of the world.\u201d Amen.","And Jesus answering said unto him
 Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him.","But he answered and said
 It is written
 Man shall not live by bread alone
 but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.","Jesus said unto him
 It is written again
 Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.","Then saith Jesus unto him
 Get thee hence
 Satan: for it is written
 Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God
 and him only shalt thou serve.","From that time Jesus began to preach
 and to say
 Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.","And he saith unto them
 Follow me
 and I will make you fishers of men.","Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.","Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.","Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.","Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.","Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.","Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.","Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.","Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.","Blessed are ye
 when men shall revile you
 and persecute you
 and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely
 for my sake.","Rejoice
 and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.","Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour
 wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing
 but to be cast out
 and to be trodden under foot of men.","Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.","Neither do men light a candle
 and put it under a bushel
 but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.","Let your light so shine before men
 that they may see your good works
 and glorify your Father which is in heaven.","Think not that I am come to destroy the law
 or the prophets: I am not come to destroy
 but to fulfil.","For verily I say unto you
 Till heaven and earth pass
 one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law
 till all be fulfilled.","Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments
 and shall teach men so
 he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them
 the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.","For I say unto you
 That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees
 ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.","Ye have heard that it was said of them of old time
 Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:","But I say unto you
 That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother
 Raca
 shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say
 Thou fool
 shall be in danger of hell fire.","Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar
 and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;","Leave there thy gift before the altar
 and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother
 and then come and offer thy gift.","Agree with thine adversary quickly
 whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge
 and the judge deliver thee to the officer
 and thou be cast into prison.","Verily I say unto thee
 Thou shalt by no means come out thence
 till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.","Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time
 Thou shalt not commit adultery:","But I say unto you
 That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.","And if thy right eye offend thee
 pluck it out
 and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish
 and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.","And if thy right hand offend thee
 cut it off
 and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish
 and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.","It hath been said
 Whosoever shall put away his wife
 let him give her a writing of divorcement:","But I say unto you
 That whosoever shall put away his wife
 saving for the cause of fornication
 causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery.","Again
 ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time
 Thou shalt not forswear thyself
 but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:","But I say unto you
 Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne:","Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.","Neither shalt thou swear by thy head
 because thou canst not make one hair white or black.","But let your communication be
 Yea
 yea; Nay
 nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.","Ye have heard that it hath been said
 An eye for an eye
 and a tooth for a tooth:","But I say unto you
 That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek
 turn to him the other also.","And if any man will sue thee at the law
 and take away thy coat
 let him have thy cloak also.","And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile
 go with him twain.","Give to him that asketh thee
 and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.","Ye have heard that it hath been said
 Thou shalt love thy neighbour
 and hate thine enemy.","But I say unto you
 Love your enemies
 bless them that curse you
 do good to them that hate you
 and pray for them which despitefully use you
 and persecute you;","That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good
 and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.","For if ye love them which love you
 what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?","And if ye salute your brethren only
 what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so?","Be ye therefore perfect
 even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.","Take heed that ye do not your alms before men
 to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.","Therefore when thou doest thine alms
 do not sound a trumpet before thee
 as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets
 that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you
 They have their reward.","But when thou doest alms
 let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:","That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.","And when thou prayest
 thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets
 that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you
 They have their reward.","But thou
 when thou prayest
 enter into thy closet
 and when thou hast shut thy door
 pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.","But when ye pray
 use not vain repetitions
 as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.","Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of
 before ye ask him.","After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven
 Hallowed be thy name.","Thy kingdom come
 Thy will be done in earth
 as it is in heaven.","Give us this day our daily bread.","And forgive us our debts
 as we forgive our debtors.","And lead us not into temptation
 but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom
 and the power
 and the glory
 for ever. Amen.","For if ye forgive men their trespasses
 your heavenly Father will also forgive you:","But if ye forgive not men their trespasses
 neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.","Moreover when ye fast
 be not
 as the hypocrites
 of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces
 that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you
 They have their reward.","But thou
 when thou fastest
 anoint thine head
 and wash thy face;","That thou appear not unto men to fast
 but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father
 which seeth in secret
 shall reward thee openly.","Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth
 where moth and rust doth corrupt
 and where thieves break through and steal:","But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven
 where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt
 and where thieves do not break through nor steal:","For where your treasure is
 there will your heart be also.","The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single
 thy whole body shall be full of light.","But if thine eye be evil
 thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness
 how great is that darkness!","No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one
 and love the other; or else he will hold to the one
 and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.","Therefore I say unto you
 Take no thought for your life
 what ye shall eat
 or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body
 what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat
 and the body than raiment?","Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not
 neither do they reap
 nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?","Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?","And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field
 how they grow; they toil not
 neither do they spin:","And yet I say unto you
 That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.","Wherefore
 if God so clothe the grass of the field
 which to day is
 and to morrow is cast into the oven
 shall he not much more clothe you
 O ye of little faith?","Therefore take no thought
 saying
 What shall we eat? or
 What shall we drink? or
 Wherewithal shall we be clothed?","(For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.","But seek ye first the kingdom of God
 and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.","Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.","Judge not
 that ye be not judged.","For with what judgment ye judge
 ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete
 it shall be measured to you again.","And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye
 but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?","Or how wilt thou say to thy brother
 Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and
 behold
 a beam is in thine own eye?","Thou hypocrite
 first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.","Give not that which is holy unto the dogs
 neither cast ye your pearls before swine
 lest they trample them under their feet
 and turn again and rend you.","Ask
 and it shall be given you; seek
 and ye shall find; knock
 and it shall be opened unto you:","For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.","Or what man is there of you
 whom if his son ask bread
 will he give him a stone?","Or if he ask a fish
 will he give him a serpent?","If ye then
 being evil
 know how to give good gifts unto your children
 how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?","Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you
 do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.","Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate
 and broad is the way
 that leadeth to destruction
 and many there be which go in thereat:","Because strait is the gate
 and narrow is the way
 which leadeth unto life
 and few there be that find it.","Beware of false prophets
 which come to you in sheep's clothing
 but inwardly they are ravening wolves.","Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns
 or figs of thistles?","Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.","A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit
 neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.","Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down
 and cast into the fire.","Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.","Not every one that saith unto me
 Lord
 Lord
 shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.","Many will say to me in that day
 Lord
 Lord
 have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?","And then will I profess unto them
 I never knew you: depart from me
 ye that work iniquity.","Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine
 and doeth them
 I will liken him unto a wise man
 which built his house upon a rock:","And the rain descended
 and the floods came
 and the winds blew
 and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.","And every one that heareth these sayings of mine
 and doeth them not
 shall be likened unto a foolish man
 which built his house upon the sand:","And the rain descended
 and the floods came
 and the winds blew
 and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.","And Jesus put forth his hand
 and touched him
 saying
 I will; be thou clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.","And Jesus saith unto him
 See thou tell no man; but go thy way
 shew thyself to the priest
 and offer the gift that Moses commanded
 for a testimony unto them.","And Jesus saith unto him
 I will come and heal him.","When Jesus heard it
 he marvelled
 and said to them that followed
 Verily I say unto you
 I have not found so great faith
 no
 not in Israel.","And I say unto you
 That many shall come from the east and west
 and shall sit down with Abraham
 and Isaac
 and Jacob
 in the kingdom of heaven.","But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.","And Jesus said unto the centurion
 Go thy way; and as thou hast believed
 so be it done unto thee. And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour.","And Jesus saith unto him
 The foxes have holes
 and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.","But Jesus said unto him
 Follow me; and let the dead bury their dead.","And he saith unto them
 Why are ye fearful
 O ye of little faith? Then he arose
 and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm.","And he said unto them
 Go. And when they were come out
 they went into the herd of swine: and
 behold
 the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea
 and perished in the waters.","And
 behold
 they brought to him a man sick of the palsy
 lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy; Son
 be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee.","And Jesus knowing their thoughts said
 Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts?","For whether is easier
 to say
 Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say
 Arise
 and walk?","But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins
 (then saith he to the sick of the palsy
) Arise
 take up thy bed
 and go unto thine house.","And as Jesus passed forth from thence
 he saw a man
 named Matthew
 sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto him
 Follow me. And he arose
 and followed him.","But when Jesus heard that
 he said unto them
 They that be whole need not a physician
 but they that are sick.","But go ye and learn what that meaneth
 I will have mercy
 and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous
 but sinners to repentance.","And Jesus said unto them
 Can the children of the bridechamber mourn
 as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come
 when the bridegroom shall be taken from them
 and then shall they fast.","No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment
 for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment
 and the rent is made worse.","Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles break
 and the wine runneth out
 and the bottles perish: but they put new wine into new bottles
 and both are preserved.","But Jesus turned him about
 and when he saw her
 he said
 Daughter
 be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour.","He said unto them
 Give place: for the maid is not dead
 but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn.","And when he was come into the house
 the blind men came to him: and Jesus saith unto them
 Believe ye that I am able to do this? They said unto him
 Yea
 Lord.","And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly charged them
 saying
 See that no man know it.","Then saith he unto his disciples
 The harvest truly is plenteous
 but the labourers are few;","Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest
 that he will send forth labourers into his harvest.","These twelve Jesus sent forth
 and commanded them
 saying
 Go not into the way of the Gentiles
 and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not:","But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.","And as ye go
 preach
 saying
 The kingdom of heaven is at hand.","Heal the sick
 cleanse the lepers
 raise the dead
 cast out devils: freely ye have received
 freely give.","Provide neither gold
 nor silver
 nor brass in your purses
","Nor scrip for your journey
 neither two coats
 neither shoes
 nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat.","And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter
 enquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence.","And when ye come into an house
 salute it.","And if the house be worthy
 let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy
 let your peace return to you.","And whosoever shall not receive you
 nor hear your words
 when ye depart out of that house or city
 shake off the dust of your feet.","Verily I say unto you
 It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment
 than for that city.","Behold
 I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents
 and harmless as doves.","But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils
 and they will scourge you in their synagogues;","And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake
 for a testimony against them and the Gentiles.","But when they deliver you up
 take no thought how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak.","For it is not ye that speak
 but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.","And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death
 and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against their parents
 and cause them to be put to death.","And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be saved.","But when they persecute you in this city
 flee ye into another: for verily I say unto you
 Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel
 till the Son of man be come.","The disciple is not above his master
 nor the servant above his lord.","It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master
 and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub
 how much more shall they call them of his household?","Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered
 that shall not be revealed; and hid
 that shall not be known.","What I tell you in darkness
 that speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear
 that preach ye upon the housetops.","And fear not them which kill the body
 but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.","Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.","But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.","Fear ye not therefore
 ye are of more value than many sparrows.","Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men
 him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven.","But whosoever shall deny me before men
 him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven.","Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace
 but a sword.","For I am come to set a man at variance against his father
 and the daughter against her mother
 and the daughter in law against her mother in law.","And a man's foes shall be they of his own household.","He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.","And he that taketh not his cross
 and followeth after me
 is not worthy of me.","He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.","He that receiveth you receiveth me
 and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.","He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward.","And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple
 verily I say unto you
 he shall in no wise lose his reward.","Jesus answered and said unto them
 Go and shew John again those things which ye do hear and see:","The blind receive their sight
 and the lame walk
 the lepers are cleansed
 and the deaf hear
 the dead are raised up
 and the poor have the gospel preached to them.","And blessed is he
 whosoever shall not be offended in me.","And as they departed
 Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John
 What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?","But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? behold
 they that wear soft clothing are in kings' houses.","But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea
 I say unto you
 and more than a prophet.","For this is he
 of whom it is written
 Behold
 I send my messenger before thy face
 which shall prepare thy way before thee.","Verily I say unto you
 Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.","And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence
 and the violent take it by force.","For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.","And if ye will receive it
 this is Elias
 which was for to come.","He that hath ears to hear
 let him hear.","But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like unto children sitting in the markets
 and calling unto their fellows
","And saying
 We have piped unto you
 and ye have not danced; we have mourned unto you
 and ye have not lamented.","For John came neither eating nor drinking
 and they say
 He hath a devil.","The Son of man came eating and drinking
 and they say
 Behold a man gluttonous
 and a winebibber
 a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified of her children.","Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done
 because they repented not:","Woe unto thee
 Chorazin! woe unto thee
 Bethsaida! for if the mighty works
 which were done in you
 had been done in Tyre and Sidon
 they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.","But I say unto you
 It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment
 than for you.","And thou
 Capernaum
 which art exalted unto heaven
 shalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works
 which have been done in thee
 had been done in Sodom
 it would have remained until this day.","But I say unto you
 That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment
 than for thee.","At that time Jesus answered and said
 I thank thee
 O Father
 Lord of heaven and earth
 because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent
 and hast revealed them unto babes.","Even so
 Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight.","All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Son
 but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father
 save the Son
 and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.","Come unto me
 all ye that labour and are heavy laden
 and I will give you rest.","Take my yoke upon you
 and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.","For my yoke is easy
 and my burden is light.","But he said unto them
 Have ye not read what David did
 when he was an hungred
 and they that were with him;","How he entered into the house of God
 and did eat the shewbread
 which was not lawful for him to eat
 neither for them which were with him
 but only for the priests?","Or have ye not read in the law
 how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath
 and are blameless?","But I say unto you
 That in this place is one greater than the temple.","But if ye had known what this meaneth
 I will have mercy
 and not sacrifice
 ye would not have condemned the guiltless.","For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day.","And he said unto them
 What man shall there be among you
 that shall have one sheep
 and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day
 will he not lay hold on it
 and lift it out?","How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days.","Then saith he to the man
 Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole
 like as the other.","And Jesus knew their thoughts
 and said unto them
 Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:","And if Satan cast out Satan
 he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand?","And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils
 by whom do your children cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges.","But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God
 then the kingdom of God is come unto you.","Or else how can one enter into a strong man's house
 and spoil his goods
 except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house.","He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.","Wherefore I say unto you
 All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.","And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man
 it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost
 it shall not be forgiven him
 neither in this world
 neither in the world to come.","Either make the tree good
 and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt
 and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by his fruit.","O generation of vipers
 how can ye
 being evil
 speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.","A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.","But I say unto you
 That every idle word that men shall speak
 they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.","For by thy words thou shalt be justified
 and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.","But he answered and said unto them
 An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it
 but the sign of the prophet Jonas:","For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.","The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation
 and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and
 behold
 a greater than Jonas is here.","The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation
 and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and
 behold
 a greater than Solomon is here.","When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man
 he walketh through dry places
 seeking rest
 and findeth none.","Then he saith
 I will return into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come
 he findeth it empty
 swept
 and garnished.","Then goeth he
 and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself
 and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation.","While he yet talked to the people
 behold
 his mother and his brethren stood without
 desiring to speak with him.","But he answered and said unto him that told him
 Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?","And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples
 and said
 Behold my mother and my brethren!","For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven
 the same is my brother
 and sister
 and mother.","And he spake many things unto them in parables
 saying
 Behold
 a sower went forth to sow;","And when he sowed
 some seeds fell by the way side
 and the fowls came and devoured them up:","Some fell upon stony places
 where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up
 because they had no deepness of earth:","And when the sun was up
 they were scorched; and because they had no root
 they withered away.","And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up
 and choked them:","But other fell into good ground
 and brought forth fruit
 some an hundredfold
 some sixtyfold
 some thirtyfold.","Who hath ears to hear
 let him hear.","He answered and said unto them
 Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven
 but to them it is not given.","For whosoever hath
 to him shall be given
 and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not
 from him shall be taken away even that he hath.","Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not
 neither do they understand.","And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias
 which saith
 By hearing ye shall hear
 and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see
 and shall not perceive:","For this people's heart is waxed gross
 and their ears are dull of hearing
 and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears
 and should understand with their heart
 and should be converted
 and I should heal them.","But blessed are your eyes
 for they see: and your ears
 for they hear.","For verily I say unto you
 That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see
 and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear
 and have not heard them.","Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.","When any one heareth the word of the kingdom
 and understandeth it not
 then cometh the wicked one
 and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side.","But he that received the seed into stony places
 the same is he that heareth the word
 and anon with joy receiveth it;","Yet hath he not root in himself
 but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word
 by and by he is offended.","He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world
 and the deceitfulness of riches
 choke the word
 and he becometh unfruitful.","But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word
 and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit
 and bringeth forth
 some an hundredfold
 some sixty
 some thirty.","Another parable put he forth unto them
 saying
 The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:","But while men slept
 his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat
 and went his way.","But when the blade was sprung up
 and brought forth fruit
 then appeared the tares also.","So the servants of the householder came and said unto him
 Sir
 didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?","He said unto them
 An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him
 Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?","But he said
 Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares
 ye root up also the wheat with them.","Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers
 Gather ye together first the tares
 and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.","Another parable put he forth unto them
 saying
 The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed
 which a man took
 and sowed in his field:","Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown
 it is the greatest among herbs
 and becometh a tree
 so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.","Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven
 which a woman took
 and hid in three measures of meal
 till the whole was leavened.","He answered and said unto them
 He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;","The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;","The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.","As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.","The Son of man shall send forth his angels
 and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend
 and them which do iniquity;","And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.","Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear
 let him hear.","Again
 the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found
 he hideth
 and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath
 and buyeth that field.","Again
 the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man
 seeking goodly pearls:","Who
 when he had found one pearl of great price
 went and sold all that he had
 and bought it.","Again
 the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net
 that was cast into the sea
 and gathered of every kind:","Which
 when it was full
 they drew to shore
 and sat down
 and gathered the good into vessels
 but cast the bad away.","So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth
 and sever the wicked from among the just
","And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.","Jesus saith unto them
 Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him
 Yea
 Lord.","Then said he unto them
 Therefore every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder
 which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old.","And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them
 A prophet is not without honour
 save in his own country
 and in his own house.","But Jesus said unto them
 They need not depart; give ye them to eat.","He said
 Bring them hither to me.","But straightway Jesus spake unto them
 saying
 Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.","And he said
 Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship
 he walked on the water
 to go to Jesus.","And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand
 and caught him
 and said unto him
 O thou of little faith
 wherefore didst thou doubt?","But he answered and said unto them
 Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?","For God commanded
 saying
 Honour thy father and mother: and
 He that curseth father or mother
 let him die the death.","But ye say
 Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother
 It is a gift
 by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;","And honour not his father or his mother
 he shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.","Ye hypocrites
 well did Esaias prophesy of you
 saying
","This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth
 and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.","But in vain they do worship me
 teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.","And he called the multitude
 and said unto them
 Hear
 and understand:","Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth
 this defileth a man.","But he answered and said
 Every plant
 which my heavenly Father hath not planted
 shall be rooted up.","Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind
 both shall fall into the ditch.","And Jesus said
 Are ye also yet without understanding?","Do not ye yet understand
 that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly
 and is cast out into the draught?","But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.","For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts
 murders
 adulteries
 fornications
 thefts
 false witness
 blasphemies:","These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.","But he answered and said
 I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.","But he answered and said
 It is not meet to take the children's bread
 and to cast it to dogs.","Then Jesus answered and said unto her
 O woman
 great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.","Then Jesus called his disciples unto him
 and said
 I have compassion on the multitude
 because they continue with me now three days
 and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting
 lest they faint in the way.","And Jesus saith unto them
 How many loaves have ye? And they said
 Seven
 and a few little fishes.","He answered and said unto them
 When it is evening
 ye say
 It will be fair weather: for the sky is red.","And in the morning
 It will be foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowering. O ye hypocrites
 ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times?","A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it
 but the sign of the prophet Jonas. And he left them
 and departed.","Then Jesus said unto them
 Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.","Which when Jesus perceived
 he said unto them
 O ye of little faith
 why reason ye among yourselves
 because ye have brought no bread?","Do ye not yet understand
 neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand
 and how many baskets ye took up?","Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand
 and how many baskets ye took up?","How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you concerning bread
 that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?","When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi
 he asked his disciples
 saying
 Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?","He saith unto them
 But whom say ye that I am?","And Jesus answered and said unto him
 Blessed art thou
 Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee
 but my Father which is in heaven.","And I say also unto thee
 That thou art Peter
 and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.","And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.","But he turned
 and said unto Peter
 Get thee behind me
 Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of God
 but those that be of men.","Then said Jesus unto his disciples
 If any man will come after me
 let him deny himself
 and take up his cross
 and follow me.","For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.","For what is a man profited
 if he shall gain the whole world
 and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?","For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works.","Verily I say unto you
 There be some standing here
 which shall not taste of death
 till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.","And Jesus came and touched them
 and said
 Arise
 and be not afraid.","And as they came down from the mountain
 Jesus charged them
 saying
 Tell the vision to no man
 until the Son of man be risen again from the dead.","And Jesus answered and said unto them
 Elias truly shall first come
 and restore all things.","But I say unto you
 That Elias is come already
 and they knew him not
 but have done unto him whatsoever they listed. Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them.","Then Jesus answered and said
 O faithless and perverse generation
 how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him hither to me.","And Jesus said unto them
 Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you
 If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed
 ye shall say unto this mountain
 Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.","And while they abode in Galilee
 Jesus said unto them
 The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:","And they shall kill him
 and the third day he shall be raised again. And they were exceeding sorry.","He saith
 Yes. And when he was come into the house
 Jesus prevented him
 saying
 What thinkest thou
 Simon? of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own children
 or of strangers?","Peter saith unto him
 Of strangers. Jesus saith unto him
 Then are the children free.","Notwithstanding
 lest we should offend them
 go thou to the sea
 and cast an hook
 and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth
 thou shalt find a piece of money: that take
 and give unto them for me and thee.","And said
 Verily I say unto you
 Except ye be converted
 and become as little children
 ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.","Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child
 the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.","And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me.","But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me
 it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck
 and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.","Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!","Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee
 cut them off
 and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed
 rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire.","And if thine eye offend thee
 pluck it out
 and cast it from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye
 rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.","Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you
 That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.","How think ye? if a man have an hundred sheep
 and one of them be gone astray
 doth he not leave the ninety and nine
 and goeth into the mountains
 and seeketh that which is gone astray?","And if so be that he find it
 verily I say unto you
 he rejoiceth more of that sheep
 than of the ninety and nine which went not astray.","Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven
 that one of these little ones should perish.","Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee
 go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee
 thou hast gained thy brother.","But if he will not hear thee
 then take with thee one or two more
 that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.","And if he shall neglect to hear them
 tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church
 let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.","Verily I say unto you
 Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.","Again I say unto you
 That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask
 it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.","For where two or three are gathered together in my name
 there am I in the midst of them.","Jesus saith unto him
 I say not unto thee
 Until seven times: but
 Until seventy times seven.","Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king
 which would take account of his servants.","And when he had begun to reckon
 one was brought unto him
 which owed him ten thousand talents.","But forasmuch as he had not to pay
 his lord commanded him to be sold
 and his wife
 and children
 and all that he had
 and payment to be made.","The servant therefore fell down
 and worshipped him
 saying
 Lord
 have patience with me
 and I will pay thee all.","Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion
 and loosed him
 and forgave him the debt.","But the same servant went out
 and found one of his fellowservants
 which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him
 and took him by the throat
 saying
 Pay me that thou owest.","And his fellowservant fell down at his feet
 and besought him
 saying
 Have patience with me
 and I will pay thee all.","And he would not: but went and cast him into prison
 till he should pay the debt.","So when his fellowservants saw what was done
 they were very sorry
 and came and told unto their lord all that was done.","Then his lord
 after that he had called him
 said unto him
 O thou wicked servant
 I forgave thee all that debt
 because thou desiredst me:","Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant
 even as I had pity on thee?","And his lord was wroth
 and delivered him to the tormentors
 till he should pay all that was due unto him.","So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you
 if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.","And he answered and said unto them
 Have ye not read
 that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female
","And said
 For this cause shall a man leave father and mother
 and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?","Wherefore they are no more twain
 but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together
 let not man put asunder.","He saith unto them
 Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.","And I say unto you
 Whosoever shall put away his wife
 except it be for fornication
 and shall marry another
 committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.","But he said unto them
 All men cannot receive this saying
 save they to whom it is given.","For there are some eunuchs
 which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs
 which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs
 which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it
 let him receive it.","But Jesus said
 Suffer little children
 and forbid them not
 to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.","And he said unto him
 Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one
 that is
 God: but if thou wilt enter into life
 keep the commandments.","He saith unto him
 Which? Jesus said
 Thou shalt do no murder
 Thou shalt not commit adultery
 Thou shalt not steal
 Thou shalt not bear false witness
","Honour thy father and thy mother: and
 Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.","Jesus said unto him
 If thou wilt be perfect
 go and sell that thou hast
 and give to the poor
 and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.","Then said Jesus unto his disciples
 Verily I say unto you
 That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.","And again I say unto you
 It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle
 than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.","But Jesus beheld them
 and said unto them
 With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.","And Jesus said unto them
 Verily I say unto you
 That ye which have followed me
 in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory
 ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones
 judging the twelve tribes of Israel.","And every one that hath forsaken houses
 or brethren
 or sisters
 or father
 or mother
 or wife
 or children
 or lands
 for my name's sake
 shall receive an hundredfold
 and shall inherit everlasting life.","But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.","For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder
 which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard.","And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day
 he sent them into his vineyard.","And he went out about the third hour
 and saw others standing idle in the marketplace
","And said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard
 and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way.","Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour
 and did likewise.","And about the eleventh hour he went out
 and found others standing idle
 and saith unto them
 Why stand ye here all the day idle?","They say unto him
 Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them
 Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right
 that shall ye receive.","So when even was come
 the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward
 Call the labourers
 and give them their hire
 beginning from the last unto the first.","And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour
 they received every man a penny.","But when the first came
 they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny.","And when they had received it
 they murmured against the goodman of the house
","Saying
 These last have wrought but one hour
 and thou hast made them equal unto us
 which have borne the burden and heat of the day.","But he answered one of them
 and said
 Friend
 I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny?","Take that thine is
 and go thy way: I will give unto this last
 even as unto thee.","Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil
 because I am good?","So the last shall be first
 and the first last: for many be called
 but few chosen.","Behold
 we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes
 and they shall condemn him to death
","And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock
 and to scourge
 and to crucify him: and the third day he shall rise again.","And he said unto her
 What wilt thou? She saith unto him
 Grant that these my two sons may sit
 the one on thy right hand
 and the other on the left
 in thy kingdom.","But Jesus answered and said
 Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of
 and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say unto him
 We are able.","But Jesus called them unto him
 and said
 Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them
 and they that are great exercise authority upon them.","But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great among you
 let him be your minister;","And whosoever will be chief among you
 let him be your servant:","Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto
 but to minister
 and to give his life a ransom for many.","And Jesus stood still
 and called them
 and said
 What will ye that I shall do unto you?","Saying unto them
 Go into the village over against you
 and straightway ye shall find an ass tied
 and a colt with her: loose them
 and bring them unto me.","And if any man say ought unto you
 ye shall say
 The Lord hath need of them; and straightway he will send them.","And said unto them
 It is written
 My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.","And said unto him
 Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus saith unto them
 Yea; have ye never read
 Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?","And when he saw a fig tree in the way
 he came to it
 and found nothing thereon
 but leaves only
 and said unto it
 Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever. And presently the fig tree withered away.","Jesus answered and said unto them
 Verily I say unto you
 If ye have faith
 and doubt not
 ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree
 but also if ye shall say unto this mountain
 Be thou removed
 and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done.","And all things
 whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer
 believing
 ye shall receive.","And Jesus answered and said unto them
 I also will ask you one thing
 which if ye tell me
 I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do these things.","The baptism of John
 whence was it? from heaven
 or of men? And they reasoned with themselves
 saying
 If we shall say
 From heaven; he will say unto us
 Why did ye not then believe him?","And they answered Jesus
 and said
 We cannot tell. And he said unto them
 Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.","But what think ye? A certain man had two sons; and he came to the first
 and said
 Son
 go work to day in my vineyard.","He answered and said
 I will not: but afterward he repented
 and went.","And he came to the second
 and said likewise. And he answered and said
 I go
 sir: and went not.","Whether of them twain did the will of his father? They say unto him
 The first. Jesus saith unto them
 Verily I say unto you
 That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.","For John came unto you in the way of righteousness
 and ye believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye
 when ye had seen it
 repented not afterward
 that ye might believe him.","Hear another parable: There was a certain householder
 which planted a vineyard
 and hedged it round about
 and digged a winepress in it
 and built a tower
 and let it out to husbandmen
 and went into a far country:","And when the time of the fruit drew near
 he sent his servants to the husbandmen
 that they might receive the fruits of it.","And the husbandmen took his servants
 and beat one
 and killed another
 and stoned another.","Again
 he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them likewise.","But last of all he sent unto them his son
 saying
 They will reverence my son.","But when the husbandmen saw the son
 they said among themselves
 This is the heir; come
 let us kill him
 and let us seize on his inheritance.","And they caught him
 and cast him out of the vineyard
 and slew him.","When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh
 what will he do unto those husbandmen?","They say unto him
 He will miserably destroy those wicked men
 and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen
 which shall render him the fruits in their seasons.","Jesus saith unto them
 Did ye never read in the scriptures
 The stone which the builders rejected
 the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing
 and it is marvellous in our eyes?","Therefore say I unto you
 The kingdom of God shall be taken from you
 and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.","And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall
 it will grind him to powder.","The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king
 which made a marriage for his son
","And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding: and they would not come.","Again
 he sent forth other servants
 saying
 Tell them which are bidden
 Behold
 I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings are killed
 and all things are ready: come unto the marriage.","But they made light of it
 and went their ways
 one to his farm
 another to his merchandise:","And the remnant took his servants
 and entreated them spitefully
 and slew them.","But when the king heard thereof
 he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies
 and destroyed those murderers
 and burned up their city.","Then saith he to his servants
 The wedding is ready
 but they which were bidden were not worthy.","Go ye therefore into the highways
 and as many as ye shall find
 bid to the marriage.","So those servants went out into the highways
 and gathered together all as many as they found
 both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests.","And when the king came in to see the guests
 he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment:","And he saith unto him
 Friend
 how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.","Then said the king to the servants
 Bind him hand and foot
 and take him away
 and cast him into outer darkness
 there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.","For many are called
 but few are chosen.","But Jesus perceived their wickedness
 and said
 Why tempt ye me
 ye hypocrites?","Shew me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny.","And he saith unto them
 Whose is this image and superscription?","They say unto him
 Caesar's. Then saith he unto them
 Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's.","Jesus answered and said unto them
 Ye do err
 not knowing the scriptures
 nor the power of God.","For in the resurrection they neither marry
 nor are given in marriage
 but are as the angels of God in heaven.","But as touching the resurrection of the dead
 have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God
 saying
","I am the God of Abraham
 and the God of Isaac
 and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead
 but of the living.","Jesus said unto him
 Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart
 and with all thy soul
 and with all thy mind.","This is the first and great commandment.","And the second is like unto it
 Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.","On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.","Saying
 What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say unto him
 The son of David.","He saith unto them
 How then doth David in spirit call him Lord
 saying
","The Lord said unto my Lord
 Sit thou on my right hand
 till I make thine enemies thy footstool?","If David then call him Lord
 how is he his son?","Saying The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat:","All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe
 that observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say
 and do not.","For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne
 and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers.","But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries
 and enlarge the borders of their garments
","And love the uppermost rooms at feasts
 and the chief seats in the synagogues
","And greetings in the markets
 and to be called of men
 Rabbi
 Rabbi.","But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master
 even Christ; and all ye are brethren.","And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father
 which is in heaven.","Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master
 even Christ.","But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.","And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted.","But woe unto you
 scribes and Pharisees
 hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves
 neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.","Woe unto you
 scribes and Pharisees
 hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte
 and when he is made
 ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.","Woe unto you
 ye blind guides
 which say
 Whosoever shall swear by the temple
 it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple
 he is a debtor!","Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater
 the gold
 or the temple that sanctifieth the gold?","And
 Whosoever shall swear by the altar
 it is nothing; but whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it
 he is guilty.","Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater
 the gift
 or the altar that sanctifieth the gift?","Whoso therefore shall swear by the altar
 sweareth by it
 and by all things thereon.","And whoso shall swear by the temple
 sweareth by it
 and by him that dwelleth therein.","And he that shall swear by heaven
 sweareth by the throne of God
 and by him that sitteth thereon.","Woe unto you
 scribes and Pharisees
 hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin
 and have omitted the weightier matters of the law
 judgment
 mercy
 and faith: these ought ye to have done
 and not to leave the other undone.","Ye blind guides
 which strain at a gnat
 and swallow a camel.","Woe unto you
 scribes and Pharisees
 hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter
 but within they are full of extortion and excess.","Thou blind Pharisee
 cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter
 that the outside of them may be clean also.","Woe unto you
 scribes and Pharisees
 hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres
 which indeed appear beautiful outward
 but are within full of dead men's bones
 and of all uncleanness.","Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men
 but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.","Woe unto you
 scribes and Pharisees
 hypocrites! because ye build the tombs of the prophets
 and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous
","And say
 If we had been in the days of our fathers
 we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.","Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves
 that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets.","Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers.","Ye serpents
 ye generation of vipers
 how can ye escape the damnation of hell?","Wherefore
 behold
 I send unto you prophets
 and wise men
 and scribes: and some of them ye shall kill and crucify; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues
 and persecute them from city to city:","That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth
 from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias
 whom ye slew between the temple and the altar.","Verily I say unto you
 All these things shall come upon this generation.","O Jerusalem
 Jerusalem
 thou that killest the prophets
 and stonest them which are sent unto thee
 how often would I have gathered thy children together
 even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings
 and ye would not!","Behold
 your house is left unto you desolate.","For I say unto you
 Ye shall not see me henceforth
 till ye shall say
 Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.","And Jesus said unto them
 See ye not all these things? verily I say unto you
 There shall not be left here one stone upon another
 that shall not be thrown down.","And Jesus answered and said unto them
 Take heed that no man deceive you.","For many shall come in my name
 saying
 I am Christ; and shall deceive many.","And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass
 but the end is not yet.","For nation shall rise against nation
 and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines
 and pestilences
 and earthquakes
 in divers places.","All these are the beginning of sorrows.","Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted
 and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.","And then shall many be offended
 and shall betray one another
 and shall hate one another.","And many false prophets shall rise
 and shall deceive many.","And because iniquity shall abound
 the love of many shall wax cold.","But he that shall endure unto the end
 the same shall be saved.","And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.","When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation
 spoken of by Daniel the prophet
 stand in the holy place
 (whoso readeth
 let him understand:)","Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains:","Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house:","Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes.","And woe unto them that are with child
 and to them that give suck in those days!","But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter
 neither on the sabbath day:","For then shall be great tribulation
 such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time
 no
 nor ever shall be.","And except those days should be shortened
 there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened.","Then if any man shall say unto you
 Lo
 here is Christ
 or there; believe it not.","For there shall arise false Christs
 and false prophets
 and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that
 if it were possible
 they shall deceive the very elect.","Behold
 I have told you before.","Wherefore if they shall say unto you
 Behold
 he is in the desert; go not forth: behold
 he is in the secret chambers; believe it not.","For as the lightning cometh out of the east
 and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.","For wheresoever the carcase is
 there will the eagles be gathered together.","Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened
 and the moon shall not give her light
 and the stars shall fall from heaven
 and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:","And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn
 and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.","And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet
 and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds
 from one end of heaven to the other.","Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender
 and putteth forth leaves
 ye know that summer is nigh:","So likewise ye
 when ye shall see all these things
 know that it is near
 even at the doors.","Verily I say unto you
 This generation shall not pass
 till all these things be fulfilled.","Heaven and earth shall pass away
 but my words shall not pass away.","But of that day and hour knoweth no man
 no
 not the angels of heaven
 but my Father only.","But as the days of Noah were
 so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.","For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking
 marrying and giving in marriage
 until the day that Noe entered into the ark
","And knew not until the flood came
 and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.","Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken
 and the other left.","Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken
 and the other left.","Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.","But know this
 that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come
 he would have watched
 and would not have suffered his house to be broken up.","Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.","Who then is a faithful and wise servant
 whom his lord hath made ruler over his household
 to give them meat in due season?","Blessed is that servant
 whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing.","Verily I say unto you
 That he shall make him ruler over all his goods.","But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart
 My lord delayeth his coming;","And shall begin to smite his fellowservants
 and to eat and drink with the drunken;","The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him
 and in an hour that he is not aware of
","And shall cut him asunder
 and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.","Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins
 which took their lamps
 and went forth to meet the bridegroom.","And five of them were wise
 and five were foolish.","They that were foolish took their lamps
 and took no oil with them:","But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.","While the bridegroom tarried
 they all slumbered and slept.","And at midnight there was a cry made
 Behold
 the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.","Then all those virgins arose
 and trimmed their lamps.","And the foolish said unto the wise
 Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.","But the wise answered
 saying
 Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell
 and buy for yourselves.","And while they went to buy
 the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.","Afterward came also the other virgins
 saying
 Lord
 Lord
 open to us.","But he answered and said
 Verily I say unto you
 I know you not.","Watch therefore
 for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.","For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country
 who called his own servants
 and delivered unto them his goods.","And unto one he gave five talents
 to another two
 and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.","Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same
 and made them other five talents.","And likewise he that had received two
 he also gained other two.","But he that had received one went and digged in the earth
 and hid his lord's money.","After a long time the lord of those servants cometh
 and reckoneth with them.","And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents
 saying
 Lord
 thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold
 I have gained beside them five talents more.","His lord said unto him
 Well done
 thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things
 I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.","He also that had received two talents came and said
 Lord
 thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold
 I have gained two other talents beside them.","His lord said unto him
 Well done
 good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things
 I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.","Then he which had received the one talent came and said
 Lord
 I knew thee that thou art an hard man
 reaping where thou hast not sown
 and gathering where thou hast not strawed:","And I was afraid
 and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo
 there thou hast that is thine.","His lord answered and said unto him
 Thou wicked and slothful servant
 thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not
 and gather where I have not strawed:","Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers
 and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.","Take therefore the talent from him
 and give it unto him which hath ten talents.","For unto every one that hath shall be given
 and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.","And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.","When the Son of man shall come in his glory
 and all the holy angels with him
 then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:","And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another
 as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats:","And he shall set the sheep on his right hand
 but the goats on the left.","Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand
 Come
 ye blessed of my Father
 inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:","For I was an hungred
 and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty
 and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger
 and ye took me in:","Naked
 and ye clothed me: I was sick
 and ye visited me: I was in prison
 and ye came unto me.","Then shall the righteous answer him
 saying
 Lord
 when saw we thee an hungred
 and fed thee? or thirsty
 and gave thee drink?","When saw we thee a stranger
 and took thee in? or naked
 and clothed thee?","Or when saw we thee sick
 or in prison
 and came unto thee?","And the King shall answer and say unto them
 Verily I say unto you
 Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren
 ye have done it unto me.","Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand
 Depart from me
 ye cursed
 into everlasting fire
 prepared for the devil and his angels:","For I was an hungred
 and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty
 and ye gave me no drink:","I was a stranger
 and ye took me not in: naked
 and ye clothed me not: sick
 and in prison
 and ye visited me not.","Then shall they also answer him
 saying
 Lord
 when saw we thee an hungred
 or athirst
 or a stranger
 or naked
 or sick
 or in prison
 and did not minister unto thee?","Then shall he answer them
 saying
 Verily I say unto you
 Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these
 ye did it not to me.","And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.","Ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover
 and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.","When Jesus understood it
 he said unto them
 Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.","For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.","For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body
 she did it for my burial.","Verily I say unto you
 Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world
 there shall also this
 that this woman hath done
 be told for a memorial of her.","And he said
 Go into the city to such a man
 and say unto him
 The Master saith
 My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.","And as they did eat
 he said
 Verily I say unto you
 that one of you shall betray me.","And he answered and said
 He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish
 the same shall betray me.","The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.","Then Judas
 which betrayed him
 answered and said
 Master
 is it I? He said unto him
 Thou hast said.","And as they were eating
 Jesus took bread
 and blessed it
 and brake it
 and gave it to the disciples
 and said
 Take
 eat; this is my body.","And he took the cup
 and gave thanks
 and gave it to them
 saying
 Drink ye all of it;","For this is my blood of the new testament
 which is shed for many for the remission of sins.","But I say unto you
 I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine
 until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.","Then saith Jesus unto them
 All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written
 I will smite the shepherd
 and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.","But after I am risen again
 I will go before you into Galilee.","Jesus said unto him
 Verily I say unto thee
 That this night
 before the cock crow
 thou shalt deny me thrice.","Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane
 and saith unto the disciples
 Sit ye here
 while I go and pray yonder.","Then saith he unto them
 My soul is exceeding sorrowful
 even unto death: tarry ye here
 and watch with me.","And he went a little farther
 and fell on his face
 and prayed
 saying
 O my Father
 if it be possible
 let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will
 but as thou wilt.","And he cometh unto the disciples
 and findeth them asleep
 and saith unto Peter
 What
 could ye not watch with me one hour?","Watch and pray
 that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing
 but the flesh is weak.","He went away again the second time
 and prayed
 saying
 O my Father
 if this cup may not pass away from me
 except I drink it
 thy will be done.","Then cometh he to his disciples
 and saith unto them
 Sleep on now
 and take your rest: behold
 the hour is at hand
 and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.","Rise
 let us be going: behold
 he is at hand that doth betray me.","And Jesus said unto him
 Friend
 wherefore art thou come? Then came they
 and laid hands on Jesus and took him.","Then said Jesus unto him
 Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.","Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father
 and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?","But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled
 that thus it must be?","In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes
 Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple
 and ye laid no hold on me.","But all this was done
 that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him
 and fled.","Jesus saith unto him
 Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you
 Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power
 and coming in the clouds of heaven.","And Peter remembered the word of Jesus
 which said unto him
 Before the cock crow
 thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out
 and wept bitterly.","And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him
 saying
 Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him
 Thou sayest.","And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice
 saying
 Eli
 Eli
 lama sabachthani? that is to say
 My God
 my God
 why hast thou forsaken me?","And as they went to tell his disciples
 behold
 Jesus met them
 saying
 All hail. And they came and held him by the feet
 and worshipped him.","Then said Jesus unto them
 Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee
 and there shall they see me.","And Jesus came and spake unto them
 saying
 All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.","Go ye therefore
 and teach all nations
 baptizing them in the name of the Father
 and of the Son
 and of the Holy Ghost:","Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and
 lo
 I am with you always
 even unto the end of the world. Amen.","But Jesus answered and said to him
 \u201cPermit it now
 for in this way it is right for us to fulfill all righteousness.\u201d Then he permitted him. ","But he answered and said
 \u201cIt is written
 \u2018Man will not live on bread alone
 but on every word that comes out of the mouth of God.\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cOn the other hand it is written
 \u2018You are not to put the Lord your God to the test.\u2019\u201d","Then Jesus said to him
 \u201cGo away
 Satan
 for it is written
 \u2018You shall worship the Lord your God and serve only him.\u2019\u201d ","From that time on
 Jesus began to preach and to say
 \u201cRepent
 because the kingdom of heaven is near.\u201d","And he said to them
 \u201cFollow me and I will make you fishers of people.\u201d ","\u201cBlessed are the poor in spirit
 because theirs is the kingdom of heaven.","Blessed are the ones who mourn
 because they will be comforted.","Blessed are the meek
 because they will inherit the earth.","Blessed are the ones who hunger and thirst for righteousness
 because they will be satisfied.","Blessed are the merciful
 because they will be shown mercy.","Blessed are the pure in heart
 because they will see God.","Blessed are the peacemakers
 because they will be called sons of God.","Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness
 because theirs is the kingdom of heaven.","Blessed are you when they insult you and persecute you and say all kinds of evil things against you
 lying on account of me. ","Rejoice and be glad
 because your reward is great in heaven
 for in the same way they persecuted the prophets before you.","\u201cYou are the salt of the earth. But if salt becomes tasteless
 by what will it be made salty? It is good for nothing any longer except to be thrown outside and trampled under foot by people. ","You are the light of the world. A city located on top of a hill cannot be hidden
 ","nor do they light a lamp and place it under a basket
 but on a lampstand
 and it shines on all those in the house. ","In the same way let your light shine before people
 so that they can see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven.","\u201cDo not think that I have come to destroy the law or the prophets. I have not come to destroy them but to fulfill them.","For truly I say to you
 until heaven and earth pass away
 not one tiny letter or one stroke of a letter will pass away from the law until all takes place. ","Therefore whoever abolishes one of the least of these commandments and teaches people to do so will be called least in the kingdom of heaven
 but whoever keeps them and teaches them
 this person will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. ","For I say to you that unless your righteousness greatly surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees
 you will never enter into the kingdom of heaven.","\u201cYou have heard that it was said to the people of old
 \u2018Do not commit murder
\u2019 and \u2018whoever commits murder will be subject to judgment.\u2019 ","But I say to you that everyone who is angry at his brother will be subject to judgment
 and whoever says to his brother
 \u2018Stupid fool!\u2019 will be subject to the council
 and whoever says
 \u2018Obstinate fool!\u2019 will be subject to fiery hell. ","Therefore if you present your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you
 ","leave your gift there before the altar and first go be reconciled to your brother
 and then come and present your gift. ","Settle the case quickly with your accuser while you are with him on the way
 lest your accuser hand you over to the judge
 and the judge to the officer
 and you be thrown into prison. ","Truly I say to you
 you will never come out of there until you have paid back the last penny!","\u201cYou have heard that it was said
 \u2018Do not commit adultery.\u2019 ","But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.","And if your right eye causes you to sin
 tear it out and throw it from you! For it is better for you that one of your members be destroyed than your whole body be thrown into hell. ","And if your right hand causes you to sin
 cut it off and throw it from you! For it is better for you that one of your limbs be destroyed than your whole body go into hell.","\u201cAnd it was said
 \u2018Whoever divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce.\u2019 ","But I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife
 except for a matter of sexual immorality
 causes her to commit adultery
 and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.","\u201cAgain you have heard that it was said to the people of old
 \u2018Do not swear falsely
 but fulfill your oaths to the Lord.\u2019 ","But I say to you
 do not swear at all
 either by heaven
 because it is the throne of God
 ","or by the earth
 because it is the footstool of his feet
 or by Jerusalem
 because it is the city of the great king. ","And do not swear by your head
 because you are not able to make one hair white or black. ","But let your statement be \u2018Yes
 yes; no
 no
\u2019 and anything beyond these is from the evil one.","\u201cYou have heard that it was said
 \u2018An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.\u2019 ","But I say to you
 do not resist the evildoer
 but whoever strikes you on the right cheek
 turn the other to him also. ","And the one who wants to go to court with you and take your tunic
 let him have your outer garment also. ","And whoever forces you to go one mile
 go with him two. ","Give to the one who asks you
 and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.","\u201cYou have heard that it was said
 \u2018Love your neighbor\u2019 and \u2018Hate your enemy.\u2019 ","But I say to you
 love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you
 ","in order that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven

 what reward do you have? Do not the tax collectors also do the same? ","And if you greet only your brothers
 what are you doing that is remarkable? Do not the Gentiles also do the same?

 do not sound a trumpet in front of you
 as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets
 in order that they may be praised by people. Truly I say to you
 they have received their reward in full! ","But you
 when you practice charitable giving
 do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing
 ","in order that your charitable giving may be in secret
 and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.","And whenever you pray
 do not be like the hypocrites
 because they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and on the corners of the streets

 they have received their reward in full! ","But whenever you pray
 enter into your inner room and shut your door and pray to your Father who is in secret

 do not babble repetitiously like the pagans

 may your name be treated as holy.","May your kingdom come
 may your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.","Give us today our daily bread

 as we also have forgiven our debtors.","And do not bring us into temptation

 your heavenly Father will also forgive you. ","But if you do not forgive people
 neither will your Father forgive your sins.","\u201cWhenever you fast
 do not be sullen like the hypocrites

 there your heart will be also.","\u201cThe eye is the lamp of the body. Therefore if your eye is sincere
 your whole body will be full of light. ","But if your eye is evil
 your whole body will be dark. Therefore if the light in you is darkness

 or he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You are not able to serve God and money.","\u201cFor this reason I say to you
 do not be anxious for your life
 what you will eat
 and not for your body
 what you will wear. Is your life not more than food and your body more than clothing? ","Consider the birds of the sky
 that they do not sow or reap or gather produce into barns

 is able to add one hour to his life span? ","And why are you anxious about clothing? Observe the lilies of the field

 so that you will not be judged. ","For by what judgment you judge
 you will be judged

 where it did not have much soil
 and it sprang up at once because it did not have any depth of soil. ","But when the sun rose it was scorched
 and because it did not have enough root
 it withered. ","And other seed fell among the thorn plants
 and the thorn plants came up and choked it. ","But other seed fell on the good soil and produced grain
 this one a hundred times as much and this one sixty and this one thirty. ","The one who has ears
 let him hear!\u201d","And he answered and said to them
 \u201cTo you it has been granted to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven

 to him more will be given
 and he will have an abundance. But whoever does not have
 even what he has will be taken away from him. ","For this reason I speak to them in parables
 because seeing they do not see
 and hearing they do not hear
 nor do they understand
 ","and with reference to them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled that says
 \u201cYou will listen carefully and will never understand
 and you will look closely and will never perceive.","For the heart of this people has become dull
 and with their ears they hear with difficulty

 so that they would not see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and turn
 and I would heal them.\u201d","But your eyes are blessed because they see
 and your ears because they hear. ","For truly I say to you that many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see
 and did not see it
 and to hear what you hear
 and did not hear it!","\u201cYou
 therefore
 listen to the parable of the sower: ","When anyone hears the word about the kingdom and does not understand it
 the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is what was sown on the side of the path. ","And what was sown on the rocky ground\u2014this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy.","But he does not have a root in himself
 but lasts only a little while
 and when affliction or persecution happens because of the word
 immediately he falls away. ","And what was sown into the thorn plants\u2014this is the one who hears the word
 and the anxiety of this world and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word and it becomes unproductive. ","But what was sown on the good soil\u2014this is the one who hears the word and understands it
 who indeed bears fruit and produces
 this one a hundred times as much
 and this one sixty
 and this one thirty.\u201d","He put before them another parable
 saying
 \u201cThe kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field. ","But while his people were sleeping
 his enemy came and sowed darnel in the midst of the wheat and went away. ","So when the wheat sprouted and yielded grain
 then the darnel appeared also. ","So the slaves of the master of the house came and said to him
 \u2018Master
 did you not sow good seed in your field? How then does it have darnel?\u2019 ","And he said to them
 \u2018An enemy has done this!\u2019 So the slaves said to him
 \u2018Then do you want us to go and gather them?\u2019 ","But he said
 \u201cNo
 lest when you gather the darnel you uproot the wheat together with it. ","Let both grow together until the harvest
 and at the season of the harvest I will tell the reapers
 \u201cFirst gather the darnel and tie it into bundles to burn them
 but gather the wheat into my storehouse.\u201d\u2019\u201d","He put before them another parable
 saying
 \u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his field. ","It is the smallest of all the seeds
 but when it is grown it is larger than the garden herbs and becomes a tree
 so that the birds of the sky come and nest in its branches.\u201d","He told them another parable: \u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and put into three measures of wheat flour until the whole batch was leavened.\u201d","So he answered and said
 \u201cThe one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man
 ","and the field is the world. And the good seed\u2014these are the sons of the kingdom
 but the darnel are the sons of the evil one. ","And the enemy who sowed them is the devil
 and the harvest is the end of the age
 and the reapers are angels. ","Thus just as the darnel is gathered and burned with fire
 so it will be at the end of the age. ","The Son of Man will send out his angels and they will gather out of his kingdom all the causes of sin and those who do lawless deeds
 ","and throw them into the fiery furnace. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth!","Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. The one who has ears
 let him hear!","\u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field
 that a man found and concealed
 and in his joy he goes and sells everything that he has and buys that field.","\u201cAgain
 the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant searching for fine pearls. ","And when he found one very valuable pearl
 he went and sold everything that he possessed and purchased it.","\u201cAgain
 the kingdom of heaven is like a dragnet that was thrown into the sea and gathered fish of every kind
 ","which when it was filled they pulled to shore and sat down and collected the good fish into containers
 but the bad they threw out. ","Thus it will be at the end of the age. The angels will go out and separate the evil from among the righteous","and throw them into the fiery furnace. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth!","\u201cHave you understood all these things?\u201d They said to him
 \u201cYes.\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cFor this reason every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like the master of the house who brings out of his storeroom new things and old things.\u201d","And they were offended by him. But Jesus said to them
 \u201cA prophet is not without honor except in his own hometown and in his own household.\u201d ","But Jesus said to them

 I am he! Do not be afraid!\u201d ","So he said
 \u201cCome!\u201d And getting out of the boat
 Peter walked on the water and came toward Jesus. ","And immediately Jesus extended his hand and caught him and said to him
 \u201cYou of little faith! Why did you doubt?\u201d ","So he answered and said to them
 \u201cWhy do you also break the commandment of God because of your tradition? ","For God said
 \u2018Honor your father and your mother
\u2019 and \u2018The one who speaks evil of father or mother must certainly die.\u2019 ","But you say
 \u2018Whoever says to his father or his mother
 \u201cWhatever benefit you would have received from me is a gift to God
\u201d ","need not honor his father
\u2019 and you make void the word of God for the sake of your tradition. ","Hypocrites! Isaiah correctly prophesied about you saying
","\u2018This people honors me with their lips
 but their heart is far
 far away from me
","and they worship me in vain
 teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.\u2019\u201d","And summoning the crowd
 he said to them
 \u201cHear and understand: ","It is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person
 but what comes out of the mouth\u2014this defiles a person.\u201d ","And he answered and said
 \u201cEvery plant that my heavenly Father did not plant will be uprooted. ","Let them! They are blind guides of the blind. And if the blind guide the blind
 both will fall into a pit.\u201d ","But he said
 \u201cAre you also still without understanding? ","Do you not understand that everything that enters into the mouth goes into the stomach and is evacuated into the latrine?","But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart
 and these defile the person. ","For from the heart come evil plans
 murder
 adultery
 sexual immorality
 theft
 false witness
 abusive speech. ","These are the things that defile a person. But eating with unwashed hands does not defile a person!\u201d","But he answered and said
 \u201cI was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\u201d ","And he answered and said
 \u201cIt is not right to take the children\u2019s bread and throw it to the dogs!\u201d ","Then Jesus answered and said to her
 \u201cO woman
 your faith is great! Let it be done for you as you want.\u201d And her daughter was healed from that hour.","And Jesus summoned his disciples and said
 \u201cI have compassion on the crowd
 because they have remained with me three days already and do not have anything to eat
 and I do not want to send them away hungry lest they give out on the way.\u201d ","And Jesus said to them
 \u201cHow many loaves do you have?\u201d So they said
 \u201cSeven
 and a few little fish.\u201d ","So he answered and said to them
 \u201cWhen evening comes you say
 \u2018It will be fair weather because the sky is red
\u2019 ","and early in the morning
 \u2018Today it will be stormy weather
 because the sky is red and darkening.\u2019 You know how to evaluate correctly the appearance of the sky
 but you are not able to evaluate the signs of the times. ","An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign
 and a sign will not be given to it except the sign of Jonah!\u201d And he left them and went away.","And Jesus said to them
 \u201cWatch out for and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees!\u201d ","But knowing this
 Jesus said
 \u201cWhy are you discussing among yourselves that you did not take bread
 you of little faith? ","Do you not yet understand or do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand
 and how many baskets you took up? ","Or the seven loaves for the four thousand and how many baskets you took up?","How do you not understand that I did not speak to you about bread? But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees!\u201d","Now when Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi
 he began asking his disciples
 saying
 \u201cWho do people say that the Son of Man is?\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cBut who do you say that I am?\u201d ","And Jesus answered and said to him
 \u201cBlessed are you
 Simon son of Jonah
 because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you
 but my Father who is in heaven. ","And I also say to you that you are Peter
 and on this rock I will build my church
 and the gates of Hades will not overpower it! ","I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven
 and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven
 and whatever you release on earth will be released in heaven.\u201d ","But he turned around and said to Peter
 \u201cGet behind me
 Satan! You are a cause for stumbling to me
 because you are not intent on the things of God
 but the things of people!\u201d","Then Jesus said to his disciples
 \u201cIf anyone wants to come after me
 let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. ","For whoever wants to save his life will lose it
 but whoever loses his life on account of me will find it. ","For what will a person be benefited if he gains the whole world but forfeits his life? Or what will a person give in exchange for his life?","For the Son of Man is going to come in the glory of his Father with his angels
 and at that time he will reward each one according to what he has done. ","Truly I say to you
 that there are some of those standing here who will never experience death until they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.\u201d","And Jesus came and touched them and said
 \u201cGet up and do not be afraid.\u201d ","And as they were coming down from the mountain
 Jesus commanded them saying
 \u201cTell no one the vision until the Son of Man is raised from the dead.\u201d ","And he answered and said
 \u201cElijah indeed is coming
 and will restore all things. ","But I say to you that Elijah has already come
 and they did not recognize him
 but did with him whatever they wanted. In the same way also the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands.\u201d ","And Jesus answered and said
 \u201cO unbelieving and perverse generation! How long will I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring him here to me!\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cBecause of your little faith. For truly I say to you
 if you have faith like a mustard seed
 you will say to this mountain
 \u2018Move from here to there
\u2019 and it will move
 and nothing will be impossible for you.\u201d","Now as they were gathering in Galilee
 Jesus said to them
 \u201cThe Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men
 ","and they will kill him
 and on the third day he will be raised.\u201d And they were extremely distressed.","He said
 \u201cYes.\u201d And when he came into the house
 Jesus spoke to him first
 saying
 \u201cWhat do you think
 Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth collect tolls or taxes\u2014from their own sons
 or from foreigners?\u201d ","And when he said
 \u201cFrom foreigners
\u201d Jesus said to him
 \u201cThen the sons are free. ","But so that we do not give offense to them
 go out to the sea
 cast a line with a hook
 and take the first fish that comes up. And when you open its mouth
 you will find a four-drachma coin. Take that and give it to them for me and you.\u201d","and said
 \u201cTruly I say to you
 unless you turn around and become like young children
 you will never enter into the kingdom of heaven! ","Therefore whoever humbles himself like this child
 this person is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven
 ","and whoever welcomes one child such as this in my name welcomes me.","But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin
 it would be better for him that a large millstone be hung on his neck and he be drowned in the depths of the sea. ","Woe to the world because of causes for stumbling
 for it is a necessity that causes for stumbling come; nevertheless
 woe to the person through whom the cause for stumbling comes. ","And if your hand or your foot causes you to sin
 cut it off and throw it from you! It is better for you to enter into life crippled or lame than
 having two hands or two feet
 to be thrown into the eternal fire! ","And if your eye causes you to sin
 tear it out and throw it from you! It is better for you to enter into life one-eyed than
 having two eyes
 to be thrown into fiery hell!","\u201cSee to it that you do not despise one of these little ones
 for I tell you that their angels in heaven constantly see the face of my Father who is in heaven. ","What do you think? If a certain man has a hundred sheep
 and one of them wanders away
 will he not leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go and look for the one that wandered away? ","And if he happens to find it
 truly I say to you that he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that did not wander away. ","In the same way it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones perish.","\u201cNow if your brother sins against you
 go correct him between you and him alone. If he listens to you
 you have gained your brother. ","But if he does not listen
 take with you in addition one or two others
 so that by the testimony of two or three witnesses every matter may be established. ","And if he refuses to listen to them
 tell it to the church. But if he refuses to listen to the church also
 let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector.","\u201cTruly I say to you
 whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven
 and whatever you release on earth will be released in heaven. ","Again
 truly I say to you that if two of you agree on earth about any matter that they ask
 it will be done for them from my Father who is in heaven. ","For where two or three are gathered in my name
 I am there in the midst of them.\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cI do not say to you up to seven times
 but up to seventy times seven!","\u201cFor this reason the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man\u2014a king\u2014who wanted to settle accounts with his slaves.","And when he began to settle them
 someone was brought to him who owed ten thousand talents. ","And because he did not have enough to repay it
 the master ordered him to be sold
 and his wife and his children and everything that he had
 and to be repaid. ","Then the slave threw himself to the ground and began to do obeisance to him
 saying
 \u2018Be patient with me
 and I will pay back everything to you!\u2019 ","So the master of that slave
 because he had compassion
 released him and forgave him the loan. ","But that slave went out and found one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii
 and taking hold of him
 he began to choke him
 saying
 \u2018Pay back everything that you owe!\u2019 ","Then his fellow slave threw himself to the ground and began to implore him
 saying
 \u2018Be patient with me and I will repay you!\u2019 ","But he did not want to
 but rather he went and threw him into prison until he would repay what was owed. ","So when his fellow slaves saw what had happened
 they were extremely distressed
 and went and reported to their master everything that had happened. ","Then his master summoned him and said to him
 \u2018Wicked slave! I forgave you all that debt because you implored me! ","Should you not also have shown mercy to your fellow slave as I also showed mercy to you?\u2019","And because he was angry
 his master handed him over to the merciless jailers until he would repay everything that was owed. ","So also my heavenly Father will do to you
 unless each of you forgives his brother from your hearts!\u201d","And he answered and said
 \u201cHave you not read that the one who created them from the beginning made them male and female ","and said
 \u2018On account of this a man will leave his father and his mother and will be joined to his wife
 and the two will become one flesh\u2019? ","So then
 they are no longer two but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together
 man must not separate.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cMoses
 with reference to your hardness of heart
 permitted you to divorce your wives
 but from the beginning it was not like this. ","Now I say to you that whoever divorces his wife
 except on the basis of sexual immorality
 and marries another commits adultery
 and whoever marries her who is divorced commits adultery.\u201d","But he said to them
 \u201cNot everyone can accept this saying but those to whom it has been given. ","For there are eunuchs who were born as such from their mother\u2019s womb
 and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by people
 and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. The one who is able to accept this
 let him accept it.\u201d","But Jesus said
 \u201cAllow the children
 and do not forbid them to come to me
 for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven.\u201d ","And he said to him
 \u201cWhy are you asking me about what is good? There is one who is good. But if you want to enter into life
 keep the commandments!\u201d ","He said to him
 \u201cWhich ones?\u201d And Jesus said
 \u201cDo not commit murder
 do not commit adultery
 do not steal
 do not give false testimony
 ","honor your father and your mother
 and love your neighbor as yourself.\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cIf you want to be perfect
 go
 sell your possessions and give the proceeds to the poor\u2014and you will have treasure in heaven\u2014and come
 follow me.\u201d ","And Jesus said to his disciples
 \u201cTruly I say to you that with difficulty a rich person will enter into the kingdom of heaven! ","And again I say to you
 it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than a rich person into the kingdom of God.\u201d ","But Jesus looked at them and said to them
 \u201cWith human beings this is impossible
 but with God all things are possible.\u201d ","And Jesus said to them
 \u201cTruly I say to you that in the renewal of the world
 when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne
 you who have followed me\u2014you also will sit on twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel. ","And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or fields on account of my name will receive a hundred times as much
 and will inherit eternal life. ","But many who are first will be last
 and the last first.","\u201cFor the kingdom of heaven is like a man\u2014the master of the house\u2014who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.","And after coming to an agreement with the workers for a denarius per day
 he sent them into his vineyard. ","And going out about the third hour
 he saw others standing idle in the marketplace. ","And to those people he said
 \u2018You also go into the vineyard
 and I will give you whatever is right.\u2019 ","So they went. Going out again about the sixth and ninth hour he did the same thing.","And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing there and said to them
 \u2018Why are you standing here the whole day unemployed?\u2019 ","They said to him
 \u2018Because no one hired us.\u2019 He said to them
 \u2018You go also into the vineyard.\u2019 ","And when evening came
 the owner of the vineyard said to his manager
 \u2018Call the workers and pay them their wages
 beginning from the last up to the first.\u2019 ","And when the ones hired about the eleventh hour came
 they received a denarius apiece. ","And when the first came
 they thought that they would receive more
 and they also received a denarius apiece. ","And when they received it
 they began to complain against the master of the house
 ","saying
 \u2018These last people worked one hour and you made them equal to us who have endured the burden of the day and the burning heat!\u2019 ","But he answered one of them and said
 \u2018Friend
 I am not doing you wrong. Did you not come to an agreement with me for a denarius? ","Take what is yours and go! But I want to give to this last person the same as I gave to you also.","Is it not permitted for me to do whatever I want with what is mine? Or is your eye evil because I am generous?\u2019","Thus the last will be first and the first last.\u201d","\u201cBehold
 we are going up to Jerusalem
 and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and scribes
 and they will condemn him to death
 ","and will hand him over to the Gentiles to mock him and flog him and crucify him
 and on the third day he will be raised.\u201d","And he said to her
 \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d She said to him
 \u201cSay that these two sons of mine may sit one at your right hand and one at your left in your kingdom.\u201d ","But Jesus answered and said
 \u201cYou do not know what you are asking! Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink?\u201d They said to him
 \u201cWe are able.\u201d ","But Jesus called them to himself and said
 \u201cYou know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them
 and those in high positions exercise authority over them. ","It will not be like this among you! But whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant
 ","and whoever wants to be most prominent among you must be your slave\u2014","just as the Son of Man did not come to be served
 but to serve
 and to give his life as a ransom for many.\u201d","And Jesus stopped
 called them
 and said
 \u201cWhat do you want me to do for you?\u201d ","saying to them
 \u201cGo into the village before you
 and right away you will find a donkey tied and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them to me. ","And if anyone says anything to you
 you will say
 \u2018The Lord needs them
\u2019 and he will send them at once.\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cIt is written
 \u2018My house will be called a house of prayer
\u2019 but you have made it a cave of robbers!\u201d","And they said to him
 \u201cDo you hear what these children are saying?\u201d So Jesus said to them
 \u201cYes
 have you never read
 \u2018Out of the mouths of children and nursing babies you have prepared for yourself praise\u2019?\u201d ","And seeing a single fig tree by the road
 he went to it and found nothing on it except leaves only. And he said to it
 \u201cMay there be no more fruit from you forever
 and the fig tree withered at once. ","And Jesus answered and said to them
 \u201cTruly I say to you
 if you have faith and do not doubt
 you will do not only what was done to the fig tree
 but even if you say to this mountain
 \u2018Be lifted up and thrown into the sea
\u201d it will happen! ","And whatever you ask in prayer
 if you believe
 you will receive.\u201d","And Jesus answered and said to them
 \u201cI also will ask you one question. If you tell the answer to me
 I also will tell you by what authority I am doing these things. ","From where was the baptism of John\u2014from heaven or from men?\u201d And they began to discuss this among themselves
 saying
 \u201cIf we say \u2018From heaven
\u2019 he will say to us
 \u2018Why then did you not believe him?\u2019 ","And they answered and said to Jesus
 \u201cWe do not know.\u201d And he said to them
 \u201cNeither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.","\u201cNow what do you think? A man had two sons. He approached the first and said
 \u2018Son
 go work in the vineyard today.\u2019 ","And he answered and said
 \u2018I do not want to!\u2019 But later he changed his mind and went. ","And he approached the second and said the same thing. So he answered and said
 \u2018I will
 sir
\u2019 and he did not go. ","Which of the two did the will of his father?\u201d They said
 \u201cThe first.\u201d Jesus said to them
 \u201cTruly I say to you that the tax collectors and the prostitutes are going ahead of you into the kingdom of God! ","For John came to you in the way of righteousness and you did not believe him
 but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did believe him. And when you saw it
 you did not even change your minds later so as to believe in him.","\u201cListen to another parable: There was a man\u2014a master of a house\u2014who planted a vineyard
 and put a fence around it
 and dug a winepress in it
 and built a watchtower
 and leased it to tenant farmers
 and went on a journey. ","And when the season of fruit drew near
 he sent his slaves to the tenant farmers to collect his fruit. ","And the tenant farmers seized his slaves
 one of whom they beat
 and one of whom they killed
 and one of whom they stoned. ","Again
 he sent other slaves
 more than the first ones
 and they did the same thing to them. ","So finally he sent his son to them
 saying
 \u2018They will respect my son.\u2019 ","But when the tenant farmers saw the son
 they said among themselves
 \u2018This is the heir. Come
 let us kill him and have his inheritance!\u2019 ","And they seized him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.","Now when the master of the vineyard arrives
 what will he do to those tenant farmers?\u201d ","They said to him
 \u201cHe will destroy those evil men completely and lease the vineyard to other tenant farmers who will give him the fruits in their season.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cHave you never read in the scriptures
 \u2018The stone which the builders rejected
 this has become the cornerstone. This came about from the Lord
 and it is marvelous in our eyes\u2019?","For this reason
 I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and will be given to a people who produce its fruits. ","And the one who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces
 and the one on whom it falls\u2014it will crush him!\u201d ","\u201cThe kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man\u2014a king\u2014who gave a wedding celebration for his son.","And he sent his slaves to summon those who had been invited to the wedding celebration
 and they did not want to come. ","Again he sent other slaves
 saying
 \u2018Tell those who have been invited

 I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and fattened cattle have been slaughtered
 and everything is ready. Come to the wedding celebration!\u201d\u2019 ","But they paid no attention and went away\u2014this one to his own field
 that one to his business. ","And the others
 seizing his slaves
 mistreated them and killed them. ","And the king was angry and sent his troops and destroyed those murderers and burned their city.","Then he said to his slaves
 \u2018The wedding celebration is ready
 but those who had been invited were not worthy. ","Therefore
 go out to the places where the roads exit the city and invite to the wedding celebration as many people as you find.\u2019 ","And those slaves went out into the roads and gathered everyone whom they found
 both evil and good
 and the wedding celebration was filled with dinner guests. ","But when the king came in to see the dinner guests
 he saw a man there not dressed in wedding clothes. ","And he said to him
 \u2018Friend
 how did you come in here
 not having wedding clothes?\u2019 But he could say nothing. ","Then the king said to the servants
 \u2018Tie him up hand and foot and throw him into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth!\u2019 ","For many are called but few are chosen.\u201d","But because he knew their maliciousness
 Jesus said
 \u201cHypocrites! Why are you testing me? ","Show me the coin for the tax!\u201d So they brought him a denarius.","And he said to them
 \u201cWhose image and inscription is this?\u201d ","They said to him
 \u201cCaesar\u2019s.\u201d Then he said to them

 \u201cYou are mistaken

 ","so that upon you will come all the righteous blood shed on the earth from the blood of righteous Abel up to the blood of Zechariah son of Barachiah
 whom you murdered between the temple and the altar. ","Truly I say to you
 all these things will come upon this generation!","\u201cJerusalem
 Jerusalem
 who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her! How many times I wanted to gather your children together the way a hen gathers her young together under her wings
 and you were not willing! ","Behold
 your house has been left to you desolate! ","For I tell you
 you will never see me from now on until you say
 \u2018Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord!\u2019\u201d","But he answered and said to them
 \u201cDo you not see all these things? Truly I say to you
 not one stone will be left here on another stone that will not be thrown down!\u201d","And Jesus answered and said to them
 \u201cWatch out that no one deceives you! ","For many will come in my name
 saying
 \u2018I am the Christ
\u2019 and they will deceive many. ","And you are going to hear about wars and rumors of wars. See to it that you are not alarmed
 for this must happen
 but the end is not yet. ","For nation will rise up against nation and kingdom against kingdom
 and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places. ","But all these things are the beginning of birth pains.","\u201cThen they will hand you over to persecution and will kill you
 and you will be hated by all the nations because of my name. ","And then many will be led into sin and will betray one another and will hate one another
 ","and many false prophets will appear and will deceive many
 ","and because lawlessness will increase
 the love of many will grow cold. ","But the one who endures to the end\u2014this person will be saved.","And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed in the whole inhabited earth for a testimony to all the nations
 and then the end will come.","\u201cSo when you see the abomination of desolation spoken about by the prophet Daniel standing in the holy place\u201d (let the one who reads understand)
 ","\u201cthen those in Judea must flee to the mountains!","The one who is on his housetop must not come down to take things out of his house
 ","and the one who is in the field must not turn back to pick up his cloak.","And woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing their babies in those days!","But pray that your flight may not happen in winter or on a Sabbath.","For at that time there will be great tribulation
 such as has not happened from the beginning of the world until now
 nor ever will happen. ","And unless those days had been shortened
 no human being would be saved. But for the sake of the elect
 those days will be shortened.","\u201cAt that time if anyone should say to you
 \u2018Behold
 here is the Christ
\u2019 or \u2018Here he is
\u2019 do not believe him! ","For false messiahs and false prophets will appear
 and will produce great signs and wonders in order to deceive
 if possible
 even the elect. ","Behold
 I have told you ahead of time! ","Therefore if they say to you
 \u2018Behold
 he is in the wilderness
\u2019 do not go out
 or \u2018Behold
 he is in the inner rooms
\u2019 do not believe it! ","For just as the lightning comes from the east and flashes to the west
 so the coming of the Son of Man will be. ","Wherever the corpse is
 there the vultures will gather.","\u201cAnd immediately after the tribulation of those days
 \u2018the sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light
 and the stars will fall from heaven
 and the powers of heaven will be shaken.\u2019","And then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven
 and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn
 and they will see the Son of Man arriving on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. ","And he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call
 and they will gather his elect together from the four winds
 from one end of heaven to the other end of it.","\u201cNow learn the parable from the fig tree: Whenever its branch has already become tender and puts forth its leaves
 you know that summer is near. ","So also you
 when you see all these things
 know that he is near
 at the door. ","Truly I say to you that this generation will never pass away until all these things take place!","Heaven and earth will pass away
 but my words will never pass away.","\u201cBut concerning that day and hour no one knows\u2014not even the angels of heaven nor the Son\u2014except the Father alone.","For just as the days of Noah were
 so the coming of the Son of Man will be. ","For as in the days before the flood they were eating and drinking
 marrying and giving in marriage
 until the day Noah entered into the ark. ","And they did not know anything until the deluge came and swept them all away. So also the coming of the Son of Man will be.","Then there will be two men in the field; one will be taken and one left.","Two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken and one left.","Therefore be on the alert
 because you do not know what day your Lord is coming! ","But understand this: that if the master of the house had known what watch of the night the thief was coming
 he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken into. ","For this reason you also must be ready
 because the Son of Man is coming at an hour that you do not think he will come.","\u201cWho then is the faithful and wise slave whom the master has put in charge of his household slaves to give them their food at the right time?","Blessed is that slave whom his master will find so doing when he comes back.","Truly I say to you that he will put him in charge of all his possessions.","But if that evil slave should say to himself
 \u2018My master is staying away for a long time
\u2019 ","and he begins to beat his fellow slaves and eats and drinks with drunkards
 ","the master of that slave will come on a day that he does not expect and at an hour that he does not know
 ","and will cut him in two and assign his place with the hypocrites. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth!","\u201cThen the kingdom of heaven may be compared to ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.","Now five of them were foolish and five were wise.","For when the foolish ones took their lamps
 they did not take olive oil with them. ","But the wise ones took olive oil in flasks with their lamps.","And when the bridegroom was delayed
 they all became drowsy and fell asleep. ","But in the middle of the night there was a shout
 \u2018Behold
 the bridegroom! Come out to meet him!\u2019 ","Then all those virgins woke up and trimmed their lamps.","And the foolish ones said to the wise ones
 \u2018Give us some of your olive oil
 because our lamps are going out!\u2019 ","But the wise ones answered saying
 \u201cCertainly there will never be enough for us and for you! Go instead to those who sell olive oil and buy some for yourselves.\u2019 ","But while they had gone away to buy it the bridegroom arrived
 and those who were ready went inside with him to the wedding celebration
 and the door was shut. ","And later the other virgins came also
 saying
 \u2018Lord
 lord
 open the door for us!\u2019 ","But he answered and said
 \u2018Truly I say to you
 I do not know you!\u2019 ","Therefore be on the alert
 because you do not know the day or the hour!","For it is like a man going on a journey. He summoned his own slaves and handed over his property to them.","And to one he gave five talents
 and to another two
 and to another one
 to each one according to his own ability
 and he went on a journey immediately. ","The one who had received the five talents went out and traded with them and gained five more.","In the same way the one who had the two gained two more.","But the one who had received the one went away and dug up the ground and hid his master\u2019s money.","Now after a long time
 the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them. ","And the one who had received the five talents came up and brought five more talents
 saying
 \u2018Master
 you handed over to me five talents. See
 I have gained five more talents!\u2019 ","His master said to him
 \u2018Well done
 good and faithful slave! You were faithful over a few things; I will put you in charge over many things. Enter into the joy of your master!\u2019 ","And the one who had the two talents also came up and said
 \u2018Master
 you handed over to me two talents. See
 I have gained two talents more!\u2019 ","His master said to him
 \u2018Well done
 good and faithful slave! You were faithful over a few things; I will put you in charge over many things. Enter into the joy of your master!\u2019 ","And the one who had received the one talent came up also and said
 \u2018Master
 because I knew you
 that you are a hard man
 reaping where you did not sow and gathering from where you did not scatter seed. ","And because I was afraid
 I went away and hid your talent in the ground. See
 you have what is yours!\u2019 ","But his master answered and said to him
 \u2018Evil and lazy slave! You knew that I reap where I did not sow and gather from where I did not scatter seed. ","Then you ought to have deposited my money with the bankers
 and when I returned I would have gotten back what was mine with interest! ","Therefore take the talent from him and give it to the one who has the ten talents.","For to everyone who has
 more will be given
 and he will have an abundance. But from the one who does not have
 even what he has will be taken away from him. ","And throw the worthless slave into the outer darkness\u2014in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth!\u2019","Now when the Son of Man comes in his glory and all the angels with him
 then he will sit on his glorious throne. ","And all the nations will be gathered before him
 and he will separate them from one another like a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. ","And he will place the sheep on his right and the goats on the left.","Then the king will say to those on his right
 \u2018Come
 you who are blessed by my Father. Inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world! ","For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat
 I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink
 I was a stranger and you welcomed me as a guest
 ","I was naked and you clothed me
 I was sick and you cared for me
 I was in prison and you came to me.\u2019 ","Then the righteous will answer him
 saying
 \u2018Lord
 when did we see you hungry and feed you
 or thirsty and give you something to drink? ","And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you as a guest
 or naked and clothe you? ","And when did we see you sick or in prison and come to you?\u2019","And the king will answer and say to them
 \u2018Truly I say to you
 in as much as you did it to one of the least of these brothers of mine
 you did it to me.\u2019 ","Then he will also say to those on his left
 \u2018Depart from me
 you accursed ones
 into the eternal fire that has been prepared for the devil and his angels! ","For I was hungry and you did not give me anything to eat
 I was thirsty and you did not give me anything to drink
 ","I was a stranger and you did not welcome me as a guest
 naked and you did not clothe me
 sick and in prison and you did not care for me.\u2019 ","Then they will also answer
 saying
 \u2018Lord
 when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and not serve you?\u2019 ","Then he will answer them
 saying
 \u2018Truly I say to you
 in as much as you did not do it to one of the least of these
 you did not do it to me.\u2019 ","And these will depart into eternal punishment
 but the righteous into eternal life.\u201d","\u201cYou know that after two days the Passover takes place
 and the Son of Man will be handed over in order to be crucified.\u201d","But Jesus
 knowing this
 said to them
 \u201cWhy do you cause trouble for the woman? For she has done a good deed for me. ","For the poor you always have with you
 but you do not always have me. ","For when this woman poured this ointment on my body
 she did it in order to prepare me for burial. ","Truly I say to you
 wherever this gospel is proclaimed in the whole world
 what this woman has done will also be told in memory of her.\u201d","And he said
 \u201cGo into the city to a certain man and tell him
 \u2018The Teacher says
 \u201cMy time is near. I am celebrating the Passover with you with my disciples.\u201d\u2019 ","And while they were eating he said
 \u201cTruly I say to you
 that one of you will betray me.\u201d ","And he answered and said
 \u201cThe one who dips his hand in the bowl with me\u2014this one will betray me. ","The Son of Man is going just as it is written about him
 but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for him if that man had not been born.\u201d ","And Judas
 the one who was betraying him
 answered and said
 \u201cSurely I am not he
 am I
 Rabbi?\u201d He said to him
 \u201cYou have said it.\u201d","Now while they were eating Jesus took bread and
 after giving thanks
 he broke it
 and giving it to the disciples
 he said
 \u201cTake
 eat
 this is my body.\u201d ","And after taking the cup and giving thanks he gave it to them
 saying
 \u201cDrink from it
 all of you
 ","for this is my blood of the covenant which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.","But I tell you
 from now on I will never drink of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of my Father.\u201d ","Then Jesus said to them
 \u201cYou will all fall away because of me during this night
 for it is written
 \u2018I will strike the shepherd and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.\u2019","But after I am raised
 I will go ahead of you into Galilee.\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cTruly I say to you that during this night
 before the rooster crows
 you will deny me three times!\u201d ","Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane
 and he said to the disciples
 \u201cSit here while I go over there and pray.\u201d ","Then he said to them
 \u201cMy soul is deeply grieved
 to the point of death. Remain here and stay awake with me.\u201d ","And going forward a little he fell down on his face
 praying and saying
 \u201cMy Father
 if it is possible
 let this cup pass from me. Nevertheless
 not as I will
 but as you will.\u201d ","And he came to the disciples and found them sleeping
 and he said to Peter
 \u201cSo
 were you not able to stay awake with me one hour? ","Stay awake and pray that you will not enter into temptation. The spirit is willing
 but the flesh is weak!\u201d ","Again for the second time he went away and prayed
 saying
 \u201cMy Father
 if this cannot pass unless I drink it
 your will must be done.\u201d ","Then he came to the disciples and said to them
 \u201cAre you still sleeping and resting? Behold
 the hour is near
 and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners. ","Get up
 let us go! Behold
 the one who is betraying me is approaching!\u201d","And Jesus said to him
 \u201cFriend
 do that for which you have come.\u201d Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus and arrested him.","Then Jesus said to him
 \u201cPut your sword back into its place! For all who take up the sword will die by the sword. ","Or do you think that I cannot call upon my Father
 and he would put at my disposal at once more than twelve legions of angels? ","How then would the scriptures be fulfilled that it must happen in this way?\u201d","At that time Jesus said to the crowds
 \u201cHave you come out with swords and clubs
 as against a robber
 to arrest me? Every day in the temple courts I sat teaching
 and you did not arrest me! ","But all this has happened in order that the scriptures of the prophets would be fulfilled.\u201d Then the disciples all abandoned him and fled.","Jesus said to him
 \u201cYou have said it. But I tell you
 from now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power and coming on the clouds of heaven.\u201d ","And Peter remembered the statement Jesus had said
 \u201cBefore the rooster crows
 you will deny me three times
\u201d and he went outside and wept bitterly.","So Jesus stood before the governor
 and the governor asked him
 saying
 \u201cAre you the king of the Jews?\u201d And Jesus said
 \u201cYou say so.\u201d ","And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice
 saying
 \u201cEli
 Eli
 lema sabachthani?\u201d (that is
 \u201cMy God
 my God
 why have you forsaken me?\u201d) ","And behold
 Jesus met them
 saying
 \u201cGreetings!\u201d And they came up and took hold of his feet and worshiped him. ","Then Jesus said to them
 \u201cDo not be afraid! Go tell my brothers that they should go to Galilee
 and there they will see me.\u201d","And Jesus approached and spoke to them
 saying
 \u201cAll authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. ","Therefore
 go and make disciples of all the nations
 baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit
 ","teaching them to observe everything I have commanded you
 and behold
 I am with you all the days until the end of the age.\u201d","Jesus said to him in reply
 \u201cAllow it now
 for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.\u201d Then he allowed him. ","He said in reply
 \u201cIt is written: \u2018One does not live by bread alone
 but by every word that comes forth from the mouth of God.\u2019\u201d","Jesus answered him
 \u201cAgain it is written
 \u2018You shall not put the Lord

 to the test.\u2019\u201d ","At this
 Jesus said to him
 \u201cGet away
 Satan! It is written: \u2018The Lord
 your God
 shall you worship and him alone shall you serve.\u2019\u201d","From that time on
 Jesus began to preach and say
 \u201cRepent
 for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cCome after me
 and I will make you fishers of men.\u201d ","\u201cBlessed are the poor in spirit
 for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.","Blessed are they who mourn

 for they will be shown mercy.","Blessed are the clean of heart
 for they will see God.","Blessed are the peacemakers
 for they will be called children of God.","Blessed are they who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness
 for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.","Blessed are you when they insult you and persecute you and utter every kind of evil against you  because of me. ","Rejoice and be glad
 for your reward will be great in heaven. Thus they persecuted the prophets who were before you.","\u201cYou are the salt of the earth. But if salt loses its taste
 with what can it be seasoned? It is no longer good for anything but to be thrown out and trampled underfoot. ","You are the light of the world. A city set on a mountain cannot be hidden. ","Nor do they light a lamp and then put it under a bushel basket; it is set on a lampstand
 where it gives light to all in the house. ","Just so
 your light must shine before others
 that they may see your good deeds and glorify your heavenly Father.","\u201cDo not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets. I have come not to abolish but to fulfill.","Amen
 I say to you
 until heaven and earth pass away
 not the smallest letter or the smallest part of a letter will pass from the law
 until all things have taken place. ","Therefore
 whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do so will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever obeys and teaches these commandments will be called greatest in the kingdom of heaven. ","I tell you
 unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees
 you will not enter into the kingdom of heaven.","\u201cYou have heard that it was said to your ancestors
 \u2018You shall not kill; and whoever kills will be liable to judgment.\u2019 ","But I say to you

\u2019 will be liable to fiery Gehenna. ","Therefore
 if you bring your gift to the altar
 and there recall that your brother has anything against you

 go first and be reconciled with your brother

 I say to you
 you will not be released until you have paid the last penny.","\u201cYou have heard that it was said
 \u2018You shall not commit adultery.\u2019","But I say to you
 everyone who looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her in his heart. ","If your right eye causes you to sin
 tear it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one of your members than to have your whole body thrown into Gehenna. ","And if your right hand causes you to sin
 cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one of your members than to have your whole body go into Gehenna.","\u201cIt was also said
 \u2018Whoever divorces his wife must give her a bill of divorce.\u2019","But I say to you

 \u2018An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.\u2019","But I say to you

 did we not prophesy in your name? Did we not drive out demons in your name? Did we not do mighty deeds in your name?\u2019 ","Then I will declare to them solemnly
 \u2018I never knew you. Depart from me
 you evildoers.\u2019","\u201cEveryone who listens to these words of mine and acts on them will be like a wise man who built his house on rock.","The rain fell
 the floods came
 and the winds blew and buffeted the house. But it did not collapse; it had been set solidly on rock. ","And everyone who listens to these words of mine but does not act on them will be like a fool who built his house on sand. ","The rain fell
 the floods came
 and the winds blew and buffeted the house. And it collapsed and was completely ruined.\u201d","He stretched out his hand
 touched him
 and said
 \u201cI will do it. Be made clean.\u201d His leprosy was cleansed immediately. ","Then Jesus said to him
 \u201cSee that you tell no one
 but go show yourself to the priest
 and offer the gift that Moses prescribed; that will be proof for them.\u201d","He said to him
 \u201cI will come and cure him.\u201d ","When Jesus heard this
 he was amazed and said to those following him
 \u201cAmen
 I say to you
 in no one in Israel have I found such faith. ","I say to you
 many will come from the east and the west
 and will recline with Abraham
 Isaac
 and Jacob at the banquet in the kingdom of heaven
 ","but the children of the kingdom will be driven out into the outer darkness
 where there will be wailing and grinding of teeth.\u201d ","And Jesus said to the centurion
 \u201cYou may go; as you have believed
 let it be done for you.\u201d And at that very hour  servant was healed.","Jesus answered him
 \u201cFoxes have dens and birds of the sky have nests
 but the Son of Man has nowhere to rest his head.\u201d ","But Jesus answered him
 \u201cFollow me
 and let the dead bury their dead.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cWhy are you terrified
 O you of little faith?\u201d Then he got up
 rebuked the winds and the sea
 and there was great calm. ","And he said to them
 \u201cGo then!\u201d They came out and entered the swine
 and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea where they drowned. ","And there people brought to him a paralytic lying on a stretcher. When Jesus saw their faith
 he said to the paralytic
 \u201cCourage
 child
 your sins are forgiven.\u201d ","Jesus knew what they were thinking
 and said
 \u201cWhy do you harbor evil thoughts? ","Which is easier
 to say
 \u2018Your sins are forgiven
\u2019 or to say
 \u2018Rise and walk\u2019? ","But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins\u201d\u2014he then said to the paralytic
 \u201cRise
 pick up your stretcher
 and go home.\u201d ","As Jesus passed on from there
 he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the customs post. He said to him
 \u201cFollow me.\u201d And he got up and followed him. ","He heard this and said
 \u201cThose who are well do not need a physician
 but the sick do. ","Go and learn the meaning of the words
 \u2018I desire mercy
 not sacrifice.\u2019 I did not come to call the righteous but sinners.\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cCan the wedding guests mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them
 and then they will fast. ","No one patches an old cloak with a piece of unshrunken cloth
 for its fullness pulls away from the cloak and the tear gets worse. ","People do not put new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise the skins burst
 the wine spills out
 and the skins are ruined. Rather
 they pour new wine into fresh wineskins
 and both are preserved.\u201d","Jesus turned around and saw her
 and said
 \u201cCourage
 daughter! Your faith has saved you.\u201d And from that hour the woman was cured.","he said
 \u201cGo away! The girl is not dead but sleeping.\u201d And they ridiculed him. ","When he entered the house
 the blind men approached him and Jesus said to them
 \u201cDo you believe that I can do this?\u201d \u201cYes
 Lord
\u201d they said to him. ","And their eyes were opened. Jesus warned them sternly
 \u201cSee that no one knows about this.\u201d ","Then he said to his disciples
 \u201cThe harvest is abundant but the laborers are few; ","so ask the master of the harvest to send out laborers for his harvest.\u201d","Jesus sent out these twelve after instructing them thus
 \u201cDo not go into pagan territory or enter a Samaritan town.","Go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. ","As you go
 make this proclamation: \u2018The kingdom of heaven is at hand.\u2019 ","Cure the sick
 raise the dead
 cleanse lepers
 drive out demons. Without cost you have received; without cost you are to give. ","Do not take gold or silver or copper for your belts; ","no sack for the journey
 or a second tunic
 or sandals
 or walking stick. The laborer deserves his keep. ","Whatever town or village you enter
 look for a worthy person in it
 and stay there until you leave. ","As you enter a house
 wish it peace. ","If the house is worthy
 let your peace come upon it; if not
 let your peace return to you. ","Whoever will not receive you or listen to your words\u2014go outside that house or town and shake the dust from your feet. ","Amen
 I say to you
 it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town.","\u201cBehold
 I am sending you like sheep in the midst of wolves; so be shrewd as serpents and simple as doves.","But beware of people
 for they will hand you over to courts and scourge you in their synagogues
 ","and you will be led before governors and kings for my sake as a witness before them and the pagans. ","When they hand you over
 do not worry about how you are to speak or what you are to say. You will be given at that moment what you are to say. ","For it will not be you who speak but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you. ","Brother will hand over brother to death
 and the father his child; children will rise up against parents and have them put to death. ","You will be hated by all because of my name
 but whoever endures to the end will be saved. ","When they persecute you in one town
 flee to another. Amen
 I say to you
 you will not finish the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes. ","No disciple is above his teacher
 no slave above his master. ","It is enough for the disciple that he become like his teacher
 for the slave that he become like his master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul
 how much more those of his household!","\u201cTherefore do not be afraid of them. Nothing is concealed that will not be revealed
 nor secret that will not be known.","What I say to you in the darkness
 speak in the light; what you hear whispered
 proclaim on the housetops. ","And do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; rather
 be afraid of the one who can destroy both soul and body in Gehenna. ","Are not two sparrows sold for a small coin? Yet not one of them falls to the ground without your Father\u2019s knowledge. ","Even all the hairs of your head are counted. ","So do not be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows. ","Everyone who acknowledges me before others I will acknowledge before my heavenly Father. ","But whoever denies me before others
 I will deny before my heavenly Father.","\u201cDo not think that I have come to bring peace upon the earth. I have come to bring not peace but the sword.","For I have come to set a man \u2018against his father
 a daughter against her mother
 and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law;","    and one\u2019s enemies will be those of his household.\u2019","\u201cWhoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me
 and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me;","and whoever does not take up his cross and follow after me is not worthy of me. ","Whoever finds his life will lose it
 and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.","\u201cWhoever receives you receives me
 and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me.","Whoever receives a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a prophet\u2019s reward
 and whoever receives a righteous man because he is righteous will receive a righteous man\u2019s reward. ","And whoever gives only a cup of cold water to one of these little ones to drink because he is a disciple\u2014amen
 I say to you
 he will surely not lose his reward.\u201d","Jesus said to them in reply
 \u201cGo and tell John what you hear and see: ","the blind regain their sight
 the lame walk
 lepers are cleansed
 the deaf hear
 the dead are raised
 and the poor have the good news proclaimed to them. ","And blessed is the one who takes no offense at me.\u201d","As they were going off
 Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John
 \u201cWhat did you go out to the desert to see? A reed swayed by the wind? ","Then what did you go out to see? Someone dressed in fine clothing? Those who wear fine clothing are in royal palaces. ","Then why did you go out? To see a prophet? Yes
 I tell you
 and more than a prophet. ","This is the one about whom it is written: \u2018Behold
 I am sending my messenger ahead of you; he will prepare your way before you.\u2019","Amen
 I say to you
 among those born of women there has been none greater than John the Baptist; yet the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. ","From the days of John the Baptist until now
 the kingdom of heaven suffers violence
 and the violent are taking it by force. ","All the prophets and the law prophesied up to the time of John. ","And if you are willing to accept it
 he is Elijah
 the one who is to come. ","Whoever has ears ought to hear.","\u201cTo what shall I compare this generation? It is like children who sit in marketplaces and call to one another
 ","\u2018We played the flute for you
 but you did not dance
 we sang a dirge but you did not mourn.\u2019 ","For John came neither eating nor drinking
 and they said
 \u2018He is possessed by a demon.\u2019 ","The Son of Man came eating and drinking and they said
 \u2018Look
 he is a glutton and a drunkard
 a friend of tax collectors and sinners.\u2019 But wisdom is vindicated by her works.\u201d","Then he began to reproach the towns where most of his mighty deeds had been done
 since they had not repented.","\u201cWoe to you
 Chorazin! Woe to you
 Bethsaida! For if the mighty deeds done in your midst had been done in Tyre and Sidon
 they would long ago have repented in sackcloth and ashes. ","But I tell you
 it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you. ","And as for you
 Capernaum: \u2018Will you be exalted to heaven? You will go down to the netherworld.\u2019 For if the mighty deeds done in your midst had been done in Sodom
 it would have remained until this day. ","But I tell you
 it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom on the day of judgment than for you.\u201d","At that time Jesus said in reply
 \u201cI give praise to you
 Father
 Lord of heaven and earth
 for although you have hidden these things from the wise and the learned you have revealed them to the childlike.","Yes
 Father
 such has been your gracious will. ","All things have been handed over to me by my Father. No one knows the Son except the Father
 and no one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son wishes to reveal him.","\u201cCome to me
 all you who labor and are burdened
 and I will give you rest.","Take my yoke upon you and learn from me
 for I am meek and humble of heart; and you will find rest for yourselves. ","For my yoke is easy
 and my burden light.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cHave you not read what David did when he and his companions were hungry
 ","how he went into the house of God and ate the bread of offering
 which neither he nor his companions but only the priests could lawfully eat? ","Or have you not read in the law that on the sabbath the priests serving in the temple violate the sabbath and are innocent? ","I say to you
 something greater than the temple is here. ","If you knew what this meant
 \u2018I desire mercy
 not sacrifice
\u2019 you would not have condemned these innocent men. ","For the Son of Man is Lord of the sabbath.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cWhich one of you who has a sheep that falls into a pit on the sabbath will not take hold of it and lift it out? ","How much more valuable a person is than a sheep. So it is lawful to do good on the sabbath.\u201d ","Then he said to the man
 \u201cStretch out your hand.\u201d He stretched it out
 and it was restored as sound as the other. ","But he knew what they were thinking and said to them
 \u201cEvery kingdom divided against itself will be laid waste
 and no town or house divided against itself will stand. ","And if Satan drives out Satan
 he is divided against himself; how
 then
 will his kingdom stand? ","And if I drive out demons by Beelzebul
 by whom do your own people drive them out? Therefore they will be your judges. ","But if it is by the Spirit of God that I drive out demons
 then the kingdom of God has come upon you. ","How can anyone enter a strong man\u2019s house and steal his property
 unless he first ties up the strong man? Then he can plunder his house. ","Whoever is not with me is against me
 and whoever does not gather with me scatters. ","Therefore
 I say to you
 every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people
 but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. ","And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven; but whoever speaks against the holy Spirit will not be forgiven
 either in this age or in the age to come.","\u201cEither declare the tree good and its fruit is good
 or declare the tree rotten and its fruit is rotten
 for a tree is known by its fruit.","You brood of vipers
 how can you say good things when you are evil? For from the fullness of the heart the mouth speaks. ","A good person brings forth good out of a store of goodness
 but an evil person brings forth evil out of a store of evil. ","I tell you
 on the day of judgment people will render an account for every careless word they speak. ","By your words you will be acquitted
 and by your words you will be condemned.\u201d","He said to them in reply
 \u201cAn evil and unfaithful generation seeks a sign
 but no sign will be given it except the sign of Jonah the prophet. ","Just as Jonah was in the belly of the whale three days and three nights
 so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights. ","At the judgment
 the men of Nineveh will arise with this generation and condemn it
 because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and there is something greater than Jonah here. ","At the judgment the queen of the south will arise with this generation and condemn it
 because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and there is something greater than Solomon here.","\u201cWhen an unclean spirit goes out of a person it roams through arid regions searching for rest but finds none. ","Then it says
 \u2018I will return to my home from which I came.\u2019 But upon returning
 it finds it empty
 swept clean
 and put in order. ","Then it goes and brings back with itself seven other spirits more evil than itself
 and they move in and dwell there; and the last condition of that person is worse than the first. Thus it will be with this evil generation.\u201d","While he was still speaking to the crowds
 his mother and his brothers appeared outside
 wishing to speak with him. ","But he said in reply to the one who told him
 \u201cWho is my mother? Who are my brothers?\u201d ","And stretching out his hand toward his disciples
 he said
 \u201cHere are my mother and my brothers. ","For whoever does the will of my heavenly Father is my brother
 and sister
 and mother.\u201d","And he spoke to them at length in parables
 saying: \u201cA sower went out to sow. ","And as he sowed
 some seed fell on the path
 and birds came and ate it up. ","Some fell on rocky ground
 where it had little soil. It sprang up at once because the soil was not deep
 ","and when the sun rose it was scorched
 and it withered for lack of roots. ","Some seed fell among thorns
 and the thorns grew up and choked it. ","But some seed fell on rich soil
 and produced fruit
 a hundred or sixty or thirtyfold. ","Whoever has ears ought to hear.\u201d","He said to them in reply
 \u201cBecause knowledge of the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven has been granted to you
 but to them it has not been granted. ","To anyone who has
 more will be given and he will grow rich; from anyone who has not
 even what he has will be taken away. ","This is why I speak to them in parables
 because \u2018they look but do not see and hear but do not listen or understand.\u2019 ","Isaiah\u2019s prophecy is fulfilled in them
 which says: \u2018You shall indeed hear but not understand
 you shall indeed look but never see.","Gross is the heart of this people
 they will hardly hear with their ears
 they have closed their eyes
 lest they see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and be converted
 and I heal them.\u2019","\u201cBut blessed are your eyes
 because they see
 and your ears
 because they hear. ","Amen
 I say to you
 many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see but did not see it
 and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.","\u201cHear then the parable of the sower. ","The seed sown on the path is the one who hears the word of the kingdom without understanding it
 and the evil one comes and steals away what was sown in his heart. ","The seed sown on rocky ground is the one who hears the word and receives it at once with joy. ","But he has no root and lasts only for a time. When some tribulation or persecution comes because of the word
 he immediately falls away. ","The seed sown among thorns is the one who hears the word
 but then worldly anxiety and the lure of riches choke the word and it bears no fruit. ","But the seed sown on rich soil is the one who hears the word and understands it
 who indeed bears fruit and yields a hundred or sixty or thirtyfold.\u201d","He proposed another parable to them. \u201cThe kingdom of heaven may be likened to a man who sowed good seed in his field.","While everyone was asleep his enemy came and sowed weeds all through the wheat
 and then went off. ","When the crop grew and bore fruit
 the weeds appeared as well. ","The slaves of the householder came to him and said
 \u2018Master
 did you not sow good seed in your field? Where have the weeds come from?\u2019 ","He answered
 \u2018An enemy has done this.\u2019 His slaves said to him
 \u2018Do you want us to go and pull them up?\u2019 ","He replied
 \u2018No
 if you pull up the weeds you might uproot the wheat along with them. ","Let them grow together until harvest; then at harvest time I will say to the harvesters
 \u201cFirst collect the weeds and tie them in bundles for burning; but gather the wheat into my barn.\u201d\u2019\u201d","He proposed another parable to them. \u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that a person took and sowed in a field. ","It is the smallest of all the seeds
 yet when full-grown it is the largest of plants. It becomes a large bush
 and the \u2018birds of the sky come and dwell in its branches.\u2019\u201d","He spoke to them another parable. \u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed with three measures of wheat flour until the whole batch was leavened.\u201d","He said in reply
 \u201cHe who sows good seed is the Son of Man
 ","the field is the world
 the good seed the children of the kingdom. The weeds are the children of the evil one
 ","and the enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age
 and the harvesters are angels. ","Just as weeds are collected and burned  with fire
 so will it be at the end of the age. ","The Son of Man will send his angels
 and they will collect out of his kingdom all who cause others to sin and all evildoers. ","They will throw them into the fiery furnace
 where there will be wailing and grinding of teeth. ","Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Whoever has ears ought to hear.","\u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like a treasure buried in a field
 which a person finds and hides again
 and out of joy goes and sells all that he has and buys that field. ","Again
 the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant searching for fine pearls. ","When he finds a pearl of great price
 he goes and sells all that he has and buys it. ","Again
 the kingdom of heaven is like a net thrown into the sea
 which collects fish of every kind. ","When it is full they haul it ashore and sit down to put what is good into buckets. What is bad they throw away. ","Thus it will be at the end of the age. The angels will go out and separate the wicked from the righteous ","and throw them into the fiery furnace
 where there will be wailing and grinding of teeth.","\u201cDo you understand all these things?\u201d They answered
 \u201cYes.\u201d","And he replied
 \u201cThen every scribe who has been instructed in the kingdom of heaven is like the head of a household who brings from his storeroom both the new and the old.\u201d ","And they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them
 \u201cA prophet is not without honor except in his native place and in his own house.\u201d "," said to them
 \u201cThere is no need for them to go away; give them some food yourselves.\u201d ","Then he said
 \u201cBring them here to me
\u201d ","At once  spoke to them
 \u201cTake courage
 it is I; do not be afraid.\u201d ","He said
 \u201cCome.\u201d Peter got out of the boat and began to walk on the water toward Jesus. ","Immediately Jesus stretched out his hand and caught him
 and said to him
 \u201cO you of little faith
 why did you doubt?\u201d ","He said to them in reply
 \u201cAnd why do you break the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition? ","For God said
 \u2018Honor your father and your mother
\u2019 and \u2018Whoever curses father or mother shall die.\u2019 ","But you say
 \u2018Whoever says to father or mother
 \u201cAny support you might have had from me is dedicated to God
\u201d ","need not honor his father.\u2019 You have nullified the word of God for the sake of your tradition. ","Hypocrites
 well did Isaiah prophesy about you when he said:","\u2018This people honors me with their lips
 but their hearts are far from me;","in vain do they worship me
 teaching as doctrines human precepts.\u2019\u201d","He summoned the crowd and said to them
 \u201cHear and understand. ","It is not what enters one\u2019s mouth that defiles that person; but what comes out of the mouth is what defiles one.\u201d ","He said in reply
 \u201cEvery plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted. ","Let them alone; they are blind guides (of the blind). If a blind person leads a blind person
 both will fall into a pit.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cAre even you still without understanding? ","Do you not realize that everything that enters the mouth passes into the stomach and is expelled into the latrine? ","But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart
 and they defile. ","For from the heart come evil thoughts
 murder
 adultery
 unchastity
 theft
 false witness
 blasphemy. ","These are what defile a person
 but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile.\u201d","He said in reply
 \u201cI was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\u201d ","He said in reply
 \u201cIt is not right to take the food of the children and throw it to the dogs.\u201d ","Then Jesus said to her in reply
 \u201cO woman
 great is your faith! Let it be done for you as you wish.\u201d And her daughter was healed from that hour.","Jesus summoned his disciples and said
 \u201cMy heart is moved with pity for the crowd
 for they have been with me now for three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry
 for fear they may collapse on the way.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cHow many loaves do you have?\u201d \u201cSeven
\u201d they replied
 \u201cand a few fish.\u201d ","He said to them in reply
 \u201c[In the evening you say
 \u2018Tomorrow will be fair

 in the morning
 \u2018Today will be stormy
 for the sky is red and threatening.\u2019 You know how to judge the appearance of the sky
 but you cannot judge the signs of the times.] ","An evil and unfaithful generation seeks a sign
 but no sign will be given it except the sign of Jonah.\u201d Then he left them and went away.","Jesus said to them
 \u201cLook out
 and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\u201d ","When Jesus became aware of this he said
 \u201cYou of little faith
 why do you conclude among yourselves that it is because you have no bread? ","Do you not yet understand
 and do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand
 and how many wicker baskets you took up? ","Or the seven loaves for the four thousand
 and how many baskets you took up? ","How do you not comprehend that I was not speaking to you about bread? Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\u201d ","When Jesus went into the region of Caesarea Philippi he asked his disciples
 \u201cWho do people say that the Son of Man is?\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cBut who do you say that I am?\u201d ","Jesus said to him in reply
 \u201cBlessed are you
 Simon son of Jonah. For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you
 but my heavenly Father. ","And so I say to you
 you are Peter

 and the gates of the netherworld shall not prevail against it. ","I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\u201d ","He turned and said to Peter
 \u201cGet behind me

 for I say to you that their angels in heaven always look upon the face of my heavenly Father.  [11 ] ","What is your opinion? If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them goes astray
 will he not leave the ninety-nine in the hills and go in search of the stray? ","And if he finds it
 amen
 I say to you
 he rejoices more over it than over the ninety-nine that did not stray. ","In just the same way
 it is not the will of your heavenly Father that one of these little ones be lost.","\u201cIf your brother sins [against you]
 go and tell him his fault between you and him alone. If he listens to you
 you have won over your brother. ","If he does not listen
 take one or two others along with you

 if two of you agree on earth about anything for which they are to pray
 it shall be granted to them by my heavenly Father. ","For where two or three are gathered together in my name
 there am I in the midst of them.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cI say to you
 not seven times but seventy-seven times. ","That is why the kingdom of heaven may be likened to a king who decided to settle accounts with his servants. ","When he began the accounting
 a debtor was brought before him who owed him a huge amount. ","Since he had no way of paying it back
 his master ordered him to be sold
 along with his wife
 his children
 and all his property
 in payment of the debt. ","At that
 the servant fell down
 did him homage
 and said
 \u2018Be patient with me
 and I will pay you back in full.\u2019 ","Moved with compassion the master of that servant let him go and forgave him the loan. ","When that servant had left
 he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a much smaller amount. He seized him and started to choke him
 demanding
 \u2018Pay back what you owe.\u2019 ","Falling to his knees
 his fellow servant begged him
 \u2018Be patient with me
 and I will pay you back.\u2019 ","But he refused. Instead
 he had him put in prison until he paid back the debt. ","Now when his fellow servants saw what had happened
 they were deeply disturbed
 and went to their master and reported the whole affair. ","His master summoned him and said to him
 \u2018You wicked servant! I forgave you your entire debt because you begged me to. ","Should you not have had pity on your fellow servant
 as I had pity on you?\u2019 ","Then in anger his master handed him over to the torturers until he should pay back the whole debt. ","So will my heavenly Father do to you
 unless each of you forgives his brother from his heart.\u201d","He said in reply
 \u201cHave you not read that from the beginning the Creator \u2018made them male and female\u2019 ","and said
 \u2018For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife
 and the two shall become one flesh\u2019? ","So they are no longer two
 but one flesh. Therefore
 what God has joined together
 no human being must separate.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cBecause of the hardness of your hearts Moses allowed you to divorce your wives
 but from the beginning it was not so. ","I say to you
 whoever divorces his wife (unless the marriage is unlawful) and marries another commits adultery.\u201d ","He answered
 \u201cNot all can accept  word
 but only those to whom that is granted. ","Some are incapable of marriage because they were born so; some
 because they were made so by others; some
 because they have renounced marriage for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Whoever can accept this ought to accept it.\u201d","but Jesus said
 \u201cLet the children come to me
 and do not prevent them; for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.\u201d ","He answered him
 \u201cWhy do you ask me about the good? There is only One who is good. If you wish to enter into life
 keep the commandments.\u201d ","He asked him
 \u201cWhich ones?\u201d And Jesus replied
 \u201c \u2018You shall not kill; you shall not commit adultery; you shall not steal; you shall not bear false witness; ","honor your father and your mother\u2019; and \u2018you shall love your neighbor as yourself.\u2019\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cIf you wish to be perfect
 go
 sell what you have and give to  poor
 and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come
 follow me.\u201d ","Then Jesus said to his disciples
 \u201cAmen
 I say to you
 it will be hard for one who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven. ","Again I say to you
 it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for one who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.\u201d ","Jesus looked at them and said
 \u201cFor human beings this is impossible
 but for God all things are possible.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cAmen
 I say to you that you who have followed me
 in the new age
 when the Son of Man is seated on his throne of glory
 will yourselves sit on twelve thrones
 judging the twelve tribes of Israel. ","And everyone who has given up houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands for the sake of my name will receive a hundred times more
 and will inherit eternal life. ","But many who are first will be last
 and the last will be first.","\u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out at dawn to hire laborers for his vineyard.","After agreeing with them for the usual daily wage
 he sent them into his vineyard. ","Going out about nine o\u2019clock
 he saw others standing idle in the marketplace
 ","and he said to them
 \u2018You too go into my vineyard
 and I will give you what is just.\u2019 ","So they went off.  he went out again around noon
 and around three o\u2019clock
 and did likewise. ","Going out about five o\u2019clock
 he found others standing around
 and said to them
 \u2018Why do you stand here idle all day?\u2019 ","They answered
 \u2018Because no one has hired us.\u2019 He said to them
 \u2018You too go into my vineyard.\u2019 ","When it was evening the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman
 \u2018Summon the laborers and give them their pay
 beginning with the last and ending with the first.\u2019 ","When those who had started about five o\u2019clock came
 each received the usual daily wage. ","So when the first came
 they thought that they would receive more
 but each of them also got the usual wage. ","And on receiving it they grumbled against the landowner
 ","saying
 \u2018These last ones worked only one hour
 and you have made them equal to us
 who bore the day\u2019s burden and the heat.\u2019 ","He said to one of them in reply
 \u2018My friend
 I am not cheating you. Did you not agree with me for the usual daily wage? ","Take what is yours and go. What if I wish to give this last one the same as you? "," am I not free to do as I wish with my own money? Are you envious because I am generous?\u2019 ","Thus
 the last will be first
 and the first will be last.\u201d","\u201cBehold
 we are going up to Jerusalem
 and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the scribes

 ","and hand him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and scourged and crucified

 \u201cWhat do you wish?\u201d She answered him

 \u201cYou do not know what you are asking. Can you drink the cup that I am going to drink?\u201d They said to him
 \u201cWe can.\u201d ","But Jesus summoned them and said
 \u201cYou know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them
 and the great ones make their authority over them felt. ","But it shall not be so among you. Rather
 whoever wishes to be great among you shall be your servant; ","whoever wishes to be first among you shall be your slave. ","Just so
 the Son of Man did not come to be served but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many.\u201d","Jesus stopped and called them and said
 \u201cWhat do you want me to do for you?\u201d ","saying to them
 \u201cGo into the village opposite you
 and immediately you will find an ass tethered
 and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them here to me. ","And if anyone should say anything to you
 reply
 \u2018The master has need of them.\u2019 Then he will send them at once.\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cIt is written: \u2018My house shall be a house of prayer
\u2019 but you are making it a den of thieves.\u201d","and said to him

 \u201cAmen

 you will receive.\u201d","Jesus said to them in reply
 \u201cI shall ask you one question
 and if you answer it for me
 then I shall tell you by what authority I do these things. ","Where was John\u2019s baptism from? Was it of heavenly or of human origin?\u201d They discussed this among themselves and said
 \u201cIf we say \u2018Of heavenly origin

 \u2018Then why did you not believe him?\u2019 ","So they said to Jesus in reply
 \u201cWe do not know.\u201d He himself said to them
 \u201cNeither shall I tell you by what authority I do these things.","\u201cWhat is your opinion? A man had two sons. He came to the first and said
 \u2018Son

 \u2018I will not
\u2019 but afterwards he changed his mind and went. ","The man came to the other son and gave the same order. He said in reply
 \u2018Yes

 \u201cThe first.\u201d Jesus said to them
 \u201cAmen
 I say to you
 tax collectors and prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God before you. ","When John came to you in the way of righteousness
 you did not believe him; but tax collectors and prostitutes did. Yet even when you saw that
 you did not later change your minds and believe him.","\u201cHear another parable. There was a landowner who planted a vineyard
 put a hedge around it
 dug a wine press in it
 and built a tower. Then he leased it to tenants and went on a journey. ","When vintage time drew near
 he sent his servants to the tenants to obtain his produce. ","But the tenants seized the servants and one they beat
 another they killed
 and a third they stoned. ","Again he sent other servants
 more numerous than the first ones

 he sent his son to them

 \u2018They will respect my son.\u2019 ","But when the tenants saw the son
 they said to one another
 \u2018This is the heir. Come
 let us kill him and acquire his inheritance.\u2019 ","They seized him
 threw him out of the vineyard
 and killed him. ","What will the owner of the vineyard do to those tenants when he comes?\u201d ","They answered him
 \u201cHe will put those wretched men to a wretched death and lease his vineyard to other tenants who will give him the produce at the proper times.\u201d ","Jesus said to them

 the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people that will produce its fruit. ","[ The one who falls on this stone will be dashed to pieces; and it will crush anyone on whom it falls.]\u201d ","\u201cThe kingdom of heaven may be likened to a king who gave a wedding feast for his son.

 you who are blessed by my Father. Inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. ","For I was hungry and you gave me food
 I was thirsty and you gave me drink
 a stranger and you welcomed me
 ","naked and you clothed me
 ill and you cared for me
 in prison and you visited me.\u2019 ","Then the righteous will answer him and say
 \u2018Lord
 when did we see you hungry and feed you
 or thirsty and give you drink? ","When did we see you a stranger and welcome you
 or naked and clothe you? ","When did we see you ill or in prison
 and visit you?\u2019 ","And the king will say to them in reply
 \u2018Amen
 I say to you
 whatever you did for one of these least brothers of mine
 you did for me.\u2019 ","Then he will say to those on his left
 \u2018Depart from me
 you accursed
 into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. ","For I was hungry and you gave me no food
 I was thirsty and you gave me no drink
 ","a stranger and you gave me no welcome
 naked and you gave me no clothing
 ill and in prison
 and you did not care for me.\u2019 ","Then they will answer and say
 \u2018Lord
 when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or ill or in prison
 and not minister to your needs?\u2019 ","He will answer them
 \u2018Amen
 I say to you
 what you did not do for one of these least ones
 you did not do for me.\u2019 ","And these will go off to eternal punishment
 but the righteous to eternal life.\u201d","\u201cYou know that in two days\u2019 time it will be Passover
 and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.\u201d ","Since Jesus knew this
 he said to them
 \u201cWhy do you make trouble for the woman? She has done a good thing for me. ","The poor you will always have with you; but you will not always have me. ","In pouring this perfumed oil upon my body
 she did it to prepare me for burial. ","Amen
 I say to you
 wherever this gospel is proclaimed in the whole world
 what she has done will be spoken of
 in memory of her.\u201d","He said
 \u201cGo into the city to a certain man and tell him
 \u2018The teacher says
 \u201cMy appointed time draws near; in your house I shall celebrate the Passover with my disciples.\u201d\u2019\u201d ","And while they were eating
 he said
 \u201cAmen
 I say to you
 one of you will betray me.\u201d ","He said in reply
 \u201cHe who has dipped his hand into the dish with me is the one who will betray me. ","The Son of Man indeed goes
 as it is written of him
 but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed. It would be better for that man if he had never been born.\u201d ","Then Judas
 his betrayer
 said in reply
 \u201cSurely it is not I
 Rabbi?\u201d He answered
 \u201cYou have said so.\u201d","While they were eating
 Jesus took bread
 said the blessing
 broke it
 and giving it to his disciples said
 \u201cTake and eat; this is my body.\u201d","Then he took a cup
 gave thanks
 and gave it to them
 saying
 \u201cDrink from it
 all of you
 ","for this is my blood of the covenant
 which will be shed on behalf of many for the forgiveness of sins. ","I tell you
 from now on I shall not drink this fruit of the vine until the day when I drink it with you new in the kingdom of my Father.\u201d ","Then Jesus said to them
 \u201cThis night all of you will have your faith in me shaken
 for it is written: \u2018I will strike the shepherd
 and the sheep of the flock will be dispersed\u2019;","but after I have been raised up
 I shall go before you to Galilee.\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cAmen
 I say to you
 this very night before the cock crows
 you will deny me three times.\u201d ","Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane
 and he said to his disciples
 \u201cSit here while I go over there and pray.\u201d","Then he said to them
 \u201cMy soul is sorrowful even to death. Remain here and keep watch with me.\u201d ","He advanced a little and fell prostrate in prayer
 saying
 \u201cMy Father
 if it is possible
 let this cup pass from me; yet
 not as I will
 but as you will.\u201d ","When he returned to his disciples he found them asleep. He said to Peter
 \u201cSo you could not keep watch with me for one hour? ","Watch and pray that you may not undergo the test. The spirit is willing
 but the flesh is weak.\u201d ","Withdrawing a second time
 he prayed again
 \u201cMy Father
 if it is not possible that this cup pass without my drinking it
 your will be done!\u201d ","Then he returned to his disciples and said to them
 \u201cAre you still sleeping and taking your rest? Behold
 the hour is at hand when the Son of Man is to be handed over to sinners. ","Get up
 let us go. Look
 my betrayer is at hand.\u201d","Jesus answered him
 \u201cFriend
 do what you have come for.\u201d Then stepping forward they laid hands on Jesus and arrested him. ","Then Jesus said to him
 \u201cPut your sword back into its sheath
 for all who take the sword will perish by the sword. ","Do you think that I cannot call upon my Father and he will not provide me at this moment with more than twelve legions of angels? ","But then how would the scriptures be fulfilled which say that it must come to pass in this way?\u201d ","At that hour Jesus said to the crowds
 \u201cHave you come out as against a robber
 with swords and clubs to seize me? Day after day I sat teaching in the temple area
 yet you did not arrest me. ","But all this has come to pass that the writings of the prophets may be fulfilled.\u201d Then all the disciples left him and fled.","Jesus said to him in reply
 \u201cYou have said so. But I tell you: From now on you will see \u2018the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Power\u2019 and \u2018coming on the clouds of heaven.\u2019\u201d","Then Peter remembered the word that Jesus had spoken: \u201cBefore the cock crows you will deny me three times.\u201d He went out and began to weep bitterly.","Now Jesus stood before the governor
 and he questioned him
 \u201cAre you the king of the Jews?\u201d Jesus said
 \u201cYou say so.\u201d","And about three o\u2019clock Jesus cried out in a loud voice
 \u201cEli
 Eli
 lema sabachthani?\u201d which means
 \u201cMy God
 my God
 why have you forsaken me?\u201d ","And behold
 Jesus met them on their way and greeted them. They approached
 embraced his feet
 and did him homage. ","Then Jesus said to them
 \u201cDo not be afraid. Go tell my brothers to go to Galilee
 and there they will see me.\u201d","Then Jesus approached and said to them
 \u201cAll power in heaven and on earth has been given to me. ","Go
 therefore
 and make disciples of all nations
 baptizing them in the name of the Father
 and of the Son

 ","teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold
 I am with you always
 until the end of the age.\u201d","But Jesus
 answering
 said to him
 \u201cAllow it at this time; for in this way it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.\u201d Then he *allowed Him.","But He answered and said
 \u201cIt is written: \u2018Man shall not live on bread alone

 \u201cOn the other hand
 it is written: \u2018You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.\u2019\u201d","Then Jesus *said to him
 \u201cGo away
 Satan! For it is written: \u2018You shall worship the Lord your God
 and serve Him only.\u2019\u201d","From that time Jesus began to preach and say
 \u201cRepent

 for they will inherit the earth.","\u201cBlessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness
 for they will be satisfied.","\u201cBlessed are the merciful
 for they will receive mercy.","\u201cBlessed are the pure in heart
 for they will see God.","\u201cBlessed are the peacemakers
 for they will be called sons of God.","\u201cBlessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness
 for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.","\u201cBlessed are you when people insult you and persecute you
 and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of Me.","Rejoice and be glad
 for your reward in heaven is great; for in this same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.","\u201cYou are the salt of the earth; but if the salt has become tasteless
 how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything
 except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by people.","\u201cYou are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden;","nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket
 but on the lampstand
 and it gives light to all who are in the house.","Your light must shine before people in such a way that they may see your good works
 and glorify your Father who is in heaven.","\u201cDo not presume that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I did not come to abolish
 but to fulfill.","For truly I say to you
 until heaven and earth pass away
 not the smallest letter or stroke of a letter shall pass from the Law
 until all is accomplished!","Therefore
 whoever nullifies one of the least of these commandments
 and teaches others to do the same
 shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever keeps and teaches them
 he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.","\u201cFor I say to you that unless your righteousness far surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees
 you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.","\u201cYou have heard that the ancients were told
 \u2018You shall not murder
\u2019 and \u2018Whoever commits murder shall be answerable to the court.\u2019","But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be answerable to the court; and whoever says to his brother
 \u2018You good-for-nothing
\u2019 shall be answerable to the supreme court; and whoever says
 \u2018You fool
\u2019 shall be guilty enough to go into the fiery hell.","Therefore
 if you are presenting your offering at the altar
 and there you remember that your brother has something against you
","leave your offering there before the altar and go; first be reconciled to your brother
 and then come and present your offering.","Come to good terms with your accuser quickly
 while you are with him on the way to court
 so that your accuser will not hand you over to the judge
 and the judge to the officer
 and you will not be thrown into prison.","Truly I say to you
 you will not come out of there until you have paid up the last quadrans.","\u201cYou have heard that it was said
 \u2018You shall not commit adultery\u2019;","but I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.","Now if your right eye is causing you to sin
 tear it out and throw it away from you; for it is better for you to lose one of the parts of your body
 than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.","And if your right hand is causing you to sin
 cut it off and throw it away from you; for it is better for you to lose one of the parts of your body
 than for your whole body to go into hell.","\u201cNow it was said
 \u2018Whoever sends his wife away is to give her a certificate of divorce\u2019;","but I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife
 except for the reason of sexual immorality
 makes her commit adultery; and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.","\u201cAgain
 you have heard that the ancients were told
 \u2018You shall not make false vows
 but shall fulfill your vows to the Lord.\u2019","But I say to you
 take no oath at all
 neither by heaven
 for it is the throne of God
","nor by the earth
 for it is the footstool of His feet
 nor by Jerusalem
 for it is the city of the great King.","Nor shall you take an oath by your head
 for you cannot make a single hair white or black.","But make sure your statement is
 \u2018Yes
 yes\u2019 or \u2018No
 no\u2019; anything beyond these is of evil origin.","\u201cYou have heard that it was said
 \u2018Eye for eye
 and tooth for tooth.\u2019","But I say to you
 do not show opposition against an evil person; but whoever slaps you on your right cheek
 turn the other toward him also.","And if anyone wants to sue you and take your tunic
 let him have your cloak also.","Whoever forces you to go one mile
 go with him two.","Give to him who asks of you
 and do not turn away from him who wants to borrow from you.","\u201cYou have heard that it was said
 \u2018You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.\u2019","But I say to you
 love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you
","so that you may prove yourselves to be sons of your Father who is in heaven; for He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good
 and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.","For if you love those who love you
 what reward do you have? Even the tax collectors
 do they not do the same?","And if you greet only your brothers and sisters
 what more are you doing than others? Even the Gentiles
 do they not do the same?","Therefore you shall be perfect
 as your heavenly Father is perfect.","\u201cTake care not to practice your righteousness in the sight of people
 to be noticed by them; otherwise you have no reward with your Father who is in heaven.","\u201cSo when you give to the poor
 do not sound a trumpet before you
 as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets
 so that they will be praised by people. Truly I say to you
 they have their reward in full.","But when you give to the poor
 do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing
","so that your charitable giving will be in secret; and your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you.","\u201cAnd when you pray
 you are not to be like the hypocrites; for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and on the street corners so that they will be seen by people. Truly I say to you
 they have their reward in full.","But as for you
 when you pray
 go into your inner room
 close your door
 and pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you.","\u201cAnd when you are praying
 do not use thoughtless repetition as the Gentiles do
 for they think that they will be heard because of their many words.","So do not be like them; for your Father knows what you need before you ask Him.","\u201cPray
 then
 in this way: \u2018Our Father
 who is in heaven
 Hallowed be Your name.","Your kingdom come. Your will be done
 On earth as it is in heaven.","Give us this day our daily bread.","And forgive us our debts
 as we also have forgiven our debtors.","And do not lead us into temptation
 but deliver us from evil.\u2019","For if you forgive other people for their offenses
 your heavenly Father will also forgive you.","But if you do not forgive other people
 then your Father will not forgive your offenses.","\u201cNow whenever you fast
 do not make a gloomy face as the hypocrites do
 for they distort their faces so that they will be noticed by people when they are fasting. Truly I say to you
 they have their reward in full.","But as for you
 when you fast
 anoint your head and wash your face
","so that your fasting will not be noticed by people but by your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you.","\u201cDo not store up for yourselves treasures on earth
 where moth and rust destroy
 and where thieves break in and steal.","But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven
 where neither moth nor rust destroys
 and where thieves do not break in or steal;","for where your treasure is
 there your heart will be also.","\u201cThe eye is the lamp of the body; so then
 if your eye is clear
 your whole body will be full of light.","But if your eye is bad
 your whole body will be full of darkness. So if the light that is in you is darkness
 how great is the darkness!","\u201cNo one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other
 or he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth.","\u201cFor this reason I say to you
 do not be worried about your life
 as to what you will eat or what you will drink; nor for your body
 as to what you will put on. Is life not more than food
 and the body more than clothing?","Look at the birds of the sky
 that they do not sow
 nor reap
 nor gather crops into barns
 and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more important than they?","And which of you by worrying can add a single day to his life\u2019s span?","And why are you worried about clothing? Notice how the lilies of the field grow; they do not labor nor do they spin thread for cloth
","yet I say to you that not even Solomon in all his glory clothed himself like one of these.","But if God so clothes the grass of the field
 which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace
 will He not much more clothe you? You of little faith!","Do not worry then
 saying
 \u2018What are we to eat?\u2019 or \u2018What are we to drink?\u2019 or \u2018What are we to wear for clothing?\u2019","For the Gentiles eagerly seek all these things; for your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.","But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness
 and all these things will be provided to you.","\u201cSo do not worry about tomorrow; for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.","\u201cDo not judge
 so that you will not be judged.","For in the way you judge
 you will be judged; and by your standard of measure
 it will be measured to you.","Why do you look at the speck that is in your brother\u2019s eye
 but do not notice the log that is in your own eye?","Or how can you say to your brother
 \u2018Let me take the speck out of your eye
\u2019 and look
 the log is in your own eye?","You hypocrite
 first take the log out of your own eye
 and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother\u2019s eye!","\u201cDo not give what is holy to dogs
 and do not throw your pearls before pigs
 or they will trample them under their feet
 and turn and tear you to pieces.","\u201cAsk
 and it will be given to you; seek
 and you will find; knock
 and it will be opened to you.","For everyone who asks receives
 and the one who seeks finds
 and to the one who knocks it will be opened.","Or what person is there among you who
 when his son asks for a loaf of bread
 will give him a stone?","Or if he asks for a fish
 he will not give him a snake
 will he?","So if you
 despite being evil
 know how to give good gifts to your children
 how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!","\u201cIn everything
 therefore
 treat people the same way you want them to treat you
 for this is the Law and the Prophets.","\u201cEnter through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction
 and there are many who enter through it.","For the gate is narrow and the way is constricted that leads to life
 and there are few who find it.","\u201cBeware of the false prophets
 who come to you in sheep\u2019s clothing
 but inwardly are ravenous wolves.","You will know them by their fruits. Grapes are not gathered from thorn bushes
 nor figs from thistles
 are they?","So every good tree bears good fruit
 but the bad tree bears bad fruit.","A good tree cannot bear bad fruit
 nor can a bad tree bear good fruit.","Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.","So then
 you will know them by their fruits.","\u201cNot everyone who says to Me
 \u2018Lord
 Lord
\u2019 will enter the kingdom of heaven
 but the one who does the will of My Father who is in heaven will enter.","Many will say to Me on that day
 \u2018Lord
 Lord
 did we not prophesy in Your name
 and in Your name cast out demons
 and in Your name perform many miracles?\u2019","And then I will declare to them
 \u2018I never knew you; leave Me
 you who practice lawlessness.\u2019","\u201cTherefore
 everyone who hears these words of Mine
 and acts on them
 will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock.","And the rain fell and the floods came
 and the winds blew and slammed against that house; and yet it did not fall
 for it had been founded on the rock.","And everyone who hears these words of Mine
 and does not act on them
 will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.","And the rain fell and the floods came
 and the winds blew and slammed against that house; and it fell\u2014and its collapse was great.\u201d","Jesus reached out with His hand and touched him
 saying
 \u201cI am willing; be cleansed.\u201d And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.","And Jesus *said to him
 \u201cSee that you tell no one; but go
 show yourself to the priest and present the offering that Moses commanded
 as a testimony to them.\u201d","Jesus *said to him
 \u201cI will come and heal him.\u201d","Now when Jesus heard this
 He was amazed and said to those who were following

 I have not found such great faith with anyone in Israel.","And I say to you that many will come from east and west
 and recline at the table with Abraham
 Isaac
 and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven;","but the sons of the kingdom will be thrown out into the outer darkness; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\u201d","And Jesus said to the centurion
 \u201cGo; it shall be done for you as you have believed.\u201d And the servant was healed at that very moment.","And Jesus *said to him
 \u201cThe foxes have holes and the birds of the sky have nests

 \u201cFollow Me
 and let the dead bury their own dead.\u201d","He *said to them
 \u201cWhy are you afraid
 you men of little faith?\u201d Then He got up and rebuked the winds and the sea
 and it became perfectly calm.","And He said to them
 \u201cGo!\u201d And they came out and went into the pigs; and behold
 the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea and drowned in the waters.","And they brought to Him a paralyzed man lying on a stretcher. And seeing their faith
 Jesus said to the man who was paralyzed
 \u201cTake courage
 son; your sins are forgiven.\u201d","And Jesus
 perceiving their thoughts
 said
 \u201cWhy are you thinking evil in your hearts?","For which is easier
 to say
 \u2018Your sins are forgiven
\u2019 or to say
 \u2018Get up and walk\u2019?","But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins\u201d\u2014then He *said to the paralyzed man
 \u201cGet up
 pick up your stretcher and go home.\u201d","As Jesus went on from there
 He saw a man called Matthew sitting in the tax collector\u2019s office; and He *said to him
 \u201cFollow Me!\u201d And he got up and followed Him.","But when Jesus heard this
 He said
 \u201cIt is not those who are healthy who need a physician
 but those who are sick.","Now go and learn what this means: \u2018I desire compassion
 rather than sacrifice
\u2019 for I did not come to call the righteous
 but sinners.\u201d","And Jesus said to them
 \u201cThe attendants of the groom cannot mourn as long as the groom is with them
 can they? But the days will come when the groom is taken away from them
 and then they will fast.","But no one puts a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; for the patch pulls away from the garment
 and a worse tear results.","Nor do people put new wine into old wineskins; otherwise the wineskins burst
 and the wine pours out and the wineskins are ruined; but they put new wine into fresh wineskins

 turning and seeing her
 said
 \u201cDaughter
 take courage; your faith has made you well.\u201d And at once the woman was made well.","He said
 \u201cLeave; for the girl has not died
 but is asleep.\u201d And they began laughing at Him.","And after He entered the house

 plead with the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into His harvest.\u201d","These twelve Jesus sent out after instructing them

 preach

 give it your greeting.","If the house is worthy
 see that your blessing of peace comes upon it. But if it is not worthy

 do not worry about how or what you are to say; for what you are to say will be given you in that hour.","For it is not you who are speaking
 but it is the Spirit of your Father who is speaking in you.","\u201cNow brother will betray brother to death
 and a father his child; and children will rise up against parents and cause them to be put to death.","And you will be hated by all because of My name
 but it is the one who has endured to the end who will be saved.","\u201cBut whenever they persecute you in one city
 flee to the next; for truly I say to you
 you will not finish going through the cities of Israel until the Son of Man comes.","\u201cA disciple is not above his teacher
 nor a slave above his master.","It is enough for the disciple that he may become like his teacher

 everyone who confesses Me before people
 I will also confess him before My Father who is in heaven.","But whoever denies Me before people
 I will also deny him before My Father who is in heaven.","\u201cDo not think that I came to bring peace on the earth; I did not come to bring peace

 and a daughter against her mother
 and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law;","and a person\u2019s enemies will be the members of his household.","\u201cThe one who loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me; and the one who loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me.","And the one who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me.","The one who has found his life will lose it
 and the one who has lost his life on My account will find it.","\u201cThe one who receives you receives Me
 and the one who receives Me receives Him who sent Me.","The one who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet\u2019s reward; and the one who receives a righteous person in the name of a righteous person shall receive a righteous person\u2019s reward.","And whoever gives one of these little ones just a cup of cold water to drink in the name of a disciple
 truly I say to you
 he shall by no means lose his reward.\u201d","Jesus answered and said to them
 \u201cGo and report to John what you hear and see:","those who are blind receive sight and those who limp walk
 those with leprosy are cleansed and those who are deaf hear
 the dead are raised
 and the poor have the gospel preached to them.","And blessed is any person who does not take offense at Me.\u201d","As these disciples of John were going away
 Jesus began speaking to the crowds about John: \u201cWhat did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?","But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Those who wear soft clothing are in kings\u2019 palaces!","But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes
 I tell you
 and one who is more than a prophet.","This is the one about whom it is written: \u2018Behold
 I am sending My messenger ahead of You
 Who will prepare Your way before You.\u2019","Truly I say to you
 among those born of women there has not arisen anyone greater than John the Baptist! Yet the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.","And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has been treated violently
 and violent men take it by force.","For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John.","And if you are willing to accept it
 John himself is Elijah who was to come.","The one who has ears to hear
 let him hear.","\u201cBut to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces
 who call out to the other children
","and say
 \u2018We played the flute for you
 and you did not dance; we sang a song of mourning
 and you did not mourn.\u2019","For John came neither eating nor drinking
 and they say
 \u2018He has a demon!\u2019","The Son of Man came eating and drinking
 and they say
 \u2018Behold
 a gluttonous man and a heavy drinker
 a friend of tax collectors and sinners!\u2019 And yet wisdom is vindicated by her deeds.\u201d","Then He began to reprimand the cities in which most of His miracles were done
 because they did not repent.","\u201cWoe to you
 Chorazin! Woe to you
 Bethsaida! For if the miracles that occurred in you had occurred in Tyre and Sidon
 they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.","Nevertheless I say to you
 it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.","And you
 Capernaum
 will not be exalted to heaven
 will you? You will be brought down to Hades! For if the miracles that occurred in you had occurred in Sodom
 it would have remained to this day.","Nevertheless I say to you that it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom on the day of judgment
 than for you.\u201d","At that time Jesus said
 \u201cI praise You
 Father
 Lord of heaven and earth
 that You have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent
 and have revealed them to infants.","Yes
 Father
 for this way was well pleasing in Your sight.","All things have been handed over to Me by My Father; and no one knows the Son except the Father; nor does anyone know the Father except the Son
 and anyone to whom the Son determines to reveal Him.","\u201cCome to Me
 all who are weary and burdened
 and I will give you rest.","Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me
 for I am gentle and humble in heart
 and you will find rest for your souls.","For My yoke is comfortable
 and My burden is light.\u201d","But He said to them
 \u201cHave you not read what David did when he became hungry
 he and his companions\u2014","how he entered the house of God
 and they ate the consecrated bread
 which was not lawful for him to eat nor for those with him
 but for the priests alone?","Or have you not read in the Law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple violate the Sabbath
 and yet are innocent?","But I say to you that something greater than the temple is here.","But if you had known what this means: \u2018I desire compassion
 rather than sacrifice
\u2019 you would not have condemned the innocent.","For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.\u201d","But He said to them
 \u201cWhat man is there among you who has a sheep
 and if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath
 will he not take hold of it and lift it out?","How much more valuable then is a person than a sheep! So then
 it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.\u201d","Then He *said to the man
 \u201cStretch out your hand!\u201d He stretched it out
 and it was restored to normal
 like the other.","And knowing their thoughts
 Jesus said to them
 \u201cEvery kingdom divided against itself is laid waste; and no city or house divided against itself will stand.","And if Satan is casting out Satan
 he has become divided against himself; how then will his kingdom stand?","And if by Beelzebul I cast out the demons
 by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore
 they will be your judges.","But if I cast out the demons by the Spirit of God
 then the kingdom of God has come upon you.","Or
 how can anyone enter the strong man\u2019s house and carry off his property
 unless he first ties up the strong man? And then he will plunder his house.","The one who is not with Me is against Me; and the one who does not gather with Me scatters.","\u201cTherefore I say to you
 every sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven people
 but blasphemy against the Spirit shall not be forgiven.","And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man
 it shall be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit
 it shall not be forgiven him
 either in this age or in the age to come.","\u201cEither assume the tree to be good as well as its fruit good
 or assume the tree to be bad as well as its fruit bad; for the tree is known by its fruit.","You offspring of vipers
 how can you
 being evil
 express any good things? For the mouth speaks from that which fills the heart.","The good person brings out of his good treasure good things; and the evil person brings out of his evil treasure evil things.","But I tell you that for every careless word that people speak
 they will give an account of it on the day of judgment.","For by your words you will be justified
 and by your words you will be condemned.\u201d","But He answered and said to them
 \u201cAn evil and adulterous generation craves a sign; and so no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet;","for just as Jonah was in the stomach of the sea monster for three days and three nights
 so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights.","The men of Nineveh will stand up with this generation at the judgment
 and will condemn it because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold
 something greater than Jonah is here.","The Queen of the South will rise up with this generation at the judgment and will condemn it
 because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold
 something greater than Solomon is here.","\u201cNow when the unclean spirit comes out of a person
 it passes through waterless places seeking rest
 and does not find it.","Then it says
 \u2018I will return to my house from which I came\u2019; and when it comes
 it finds it unoccupied
 swept
 and put in order.","Then it goes and brings along with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself
 and they come in and live there; and the last condition of that person becomes worse than the first. That is the way it will also be with this evil generation.\u201d","While He was still speaking to the crowds
 behold
 His mother and brothers were standing outside
 seeking to speak to Him.","But Jesus replied to the one who was telling Him and said
 \u201cWho is My mother
 and who are My brothers?\u201d","And extending His hand toward His disciples
 He said
 \u201cBehold: My mother and My brothers!","For whoever does the will of My Father who is in heaven
 he is My brother
 and sister
 and mother.\u201d","And He told them many things in parables
 saying
 \u201cBehold
 the sower went out to sow;","and as he sowed
 some seeds fell beside the road
 and the birds came and ate them up.","Others fell on the rocky places
 where they did not have much soil; and they sprang up immediately
 because they had no depth of soil.","But after the sun rose
 they were scorched; and because they had no root
 they withered away.","Others fell among the thorns
 and the thorns came up and choked them out.","But others fell on the good soil and yielded a crop
 some a hundred
 some sixty
 and some thirty times as much.","The one who has ears
 let him hear.\u201d","And Jesus answered them
 \u201cTo you it has been granted to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven
 but to them it has not been granted.","For whoever has
 to him more shall be given
 and he will have an abundance; but whoever does not have
 even what he has shall be taken away from him.","Therefore I speak to them in parables; because while seeing they do not see
 and while hearing they do not hear
 nor do they understand.","And in their case the prophecy of Isaiah is being fulfilled
 which says
 \u2018You shall keep on listening
 but shall not understand; And you shall keep on looking
 but shall not perceive;","For the heart of this people has become dull
 With their ears they scarcely hear
 And they have closed their eyes
 Otherwise they might see with their eyes
 Hear with their ears
 Understand with their heart
 and return
 And I would heal them.\u2019","But blessed are your eyes
 because they see; and your ears
 because they hear.","For truly I say to you that many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see
 and did not see it
 and to hear what you hear
 and did not hear it.","\u201cListen then to the parable of the sower.","When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it
 the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart. This is the one sown with seed beside the road.","The one sown with seed on the rocky places
 this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy;","yet he has no firm root in himself
 but is only temporary
 and when affliction or persecution occurs because of the word
 immediately he falls away.","And the one sown with seed among the thorns
 this is the one who hears the word
 and the anxiety of the world and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word
 and it becomes unfruitful.","But the one sown with seed on the good soil
 this is the one who hears the word and understands it
 who indeed bears fruit and produces
 some a hundred
 some sixty
 and some thirty times as much.\u201d","Jesus presented another parable to them
 saying
 \u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.","But while his men were sleeping
 his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat
 and left.","And when the wheat sprouted and produced grain
 then the weeds also became evident.","And the slaves of the landowner came and said to him
 \u2018Sir
 did you not sow good seed in your field? How then does it have weeds?\u2019","And he said to them
 \u2018An enemy has done this!\u2019 The slaves *said to him
 \u2018Do you want us
 then
 to go and gather them up?\u2019","But he *said
 \u2018No; while you are gathering up the weeds
 you may uproot the wheat with them.","Allow both to grow together until the harvest; and at the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers
 \u201cFirst gather up the weeds and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn.\u201d\u2019\u201d","He presented another parable to them
 saying
 \u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed
 which a person took and sowed in his field;","and this is smaller than all the other seeds
 but when it is fully grown
 it is larger than the garden plants and becomes a tree
 so that the birds of the sky come and nest in its branches.\u201d","He spoke another parable to them: \u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like leaven
 which a woman took and hid in three sata of flour until it was all leavened.\u201d","And He said
 \u201cThe one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man
","and the field is the world; and as for the good seed
 these are the sons of the kingdom; and the weeds are the sons of the evil one;","and the enemy who sowed them is the devil
 and the harvest is the end of the age; and the reapers are angels.","So just as the weeds are gathered up and burned with fire
 so shall it be at the end of the age.","The Son of Man will send forth His angels
 and they will gather out of His kingdom all stumbling blocks
 and those who commit lawlessness
","and they will throw them into the furnace of fire; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.","Then the righteous will shine forth like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. The one who has ears
 let him hear.","\u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field
 which a man found and hid again; and from joy over it he goes and sells everything that he has
 and buys that field.","\u201cAgain
 the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking fine pearls
","and upon finding one pearl of great value
 he went and sold everything that he had and bought it.","\u201cAgain
 the kingdom of heaven is like a dragnet that was cast into the sea and gathered fish of every kind;","and when it was filled
 they pulled it up on the beach; and they sat down and gathered the good fish into containers
 but the bad they threw away.","So it will be at the end of the age: the angels will come forth and remove the wicked from among the righteous
","and they will throw them into the furnace of fire; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.","\u201cHave you understood all these things?\u201d They *said to Him
 \u201cYes.\u201d","And Jesus said to them
 \u201cTherefore every scribe who has become a disciple of the kingdom of heaven is like a head of a household
 who brings out of his treasure new things and old.\u201d","And they took offense at Him. But Jesus said to them
 \u201cA prophet is not dishonored except in his hometown and in his own household.\u201d","But Jesus said to them
 \u201cThey do not need to go; you give them something to eat!\u201d","And He said
 \u201cBring them here to Me.\u201d","But immediately Jesus spoke to them
 saying
 \u201cTake courage
 it is I; do not be afraid.\u201d","And He said
 \u201cCome!\u201d And Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water
 and came toward Jesus.","Immediately Jesus reached out with His hand and took hold of him
 and *said to him
 \u201cYou of little faith
 why did you doubt?\u201d","And He answered and said to them
 \u201cWhy do you yourselves also break the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?","For God said
 \u2018Honor your father and mother
\u2019 and
 \u2018The one who speaks evil of father or mother is to be put to death.\u2019","But you say
 \u2018Whoever says to his father or mother
 \u201cWhatever I have that would help you has been given to God
\u201d","he is not to honor his father or mother.\u2019 And by this you have invalidated the word of God for the sake of your tradition.","You hypocrites
 rightly did Isaiah prophesy about you
 by saying:","\u2018This people honors Me with their lips
 But their heart is far away from Me.","And in vain do they worship Me
 Teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.\u2019\u201d","After Jesus called the crowd to Him
 He said to them
 \u201cHear and understand!","It is not what enters the mouth that defiles the person
 but what comes out of the mouth
 this defiles the person.\u201d","But He answered and said
 \u201cEvery plant which My heavenly Father did not plant will be uprooted.","Leave them alone; they are blind guides of blind people. And if a person who is blind guides another who is blind
 both will fall into a pit.\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cAre you also still lacking in understanding?","Do you not understand that everything that goes into the mouth passes into the stomach
 and is eliminated?","But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart
 and those things defile the person.","For out of the heart come evil thoughts
 murders
 acts of adultery
 other immoral sexual acts
 thefts
 false testimonies
 and slanderous statements.","These are the things that defile the person; but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile the person.\u201d","But He answered and said
 \u201cI was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\u201d","Yet He answered and said
 \u201cIt is not good to take the children\u2019s bread and throw it to the dogs.\u201d","Then Jesus said to her
 \u201cO woman
 your faith is great; it shall be done for you as you desire.\u201d And her daughter was healed at once.","Now Jesus called His disciples to Him and said
 \u201cI feel compassion for the people
 because they have remained with Me now for three days and have nothing to eat; and I do not want to send them away hungry
 for they might faint on the way.\u201d","And Jesus *said to them
 \u201cHow many loaves do you have?\u201d And they said
 \u201cSeven
 and a few small fish.\u201d","But He replied to them
 \u201cWhen it is evening
 you say
 \u2018It will be fair weather
 for the sky is red.\u2019","And in the morning
 \u2018There will be a storm today
 for the sky is red and threatening.\u2019 You know how to discern the appearance of the sky
 but are you unable to discern the signs of the times?","An evil and adulterous generation wants a sign; and so a sign will not be given to it
 except the sign of Jonah.\u201d And He left them and went away.","And Jesus said to them
 \u201cWatch out and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\u201d","But Jesus
 aware of this
 said
 \u201cYou men of little faith
 why are you discussing among yourselves the fact that you have no bread?","Do you not yet understand nor remember the five loaves of the five thousand
 and how many baskets you picked up?","Nor the seven loaves of the four thousand
 and how many large baskets you picked up?","How is it that you do not understand that I did not speak to you about bread? But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\u201d","Now when Jesus came into the region of Caesarea Philippi
 He was asking His disciples
 \u201cWho do people say that the Son of Man is?\u201d","He *said to them
 \u201cBut who do you yourselves say that I am?\u201d","And Jesus said to him
 \u201cBlessed are you
 Simon Barjona
 because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you
 but My Father who is in heaven.","And I also say to you that you are Peter
 and upon this rock I will build My church; and the gates of Hades will not overpower it.","I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatever you bind on earth shall have been bound in heaven
 and whatever you loose on earth shall have been loosed in heaven.\u201d","But He turned and said to Peter
 \u201cGet behind Me
 Satan! You are a stumbling block to Me; for you are not setting your mind on God\u2019s purposes
 but men\u2019s.\u201d","Then Jesus said to His disciples
 \u201cIf anyone wants to come after Me
 he must deny himself
 take up his cross
 and follow Me.","For whoever wants to save his life will lose it; but whoever loses his life for My sake will find it.","For what good will it do a person if he gains the whole world
 but forfeits his soul? Or what will a person give in exchange for his soul?","For the Son of Man is going to come in the glory of His Father with His angels
 and will then repay every person according to his deeds.","\u201cTruly I say to you
 there are some of those who are standing here who will not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom.\u201d","And Jesus came to them and touched them and said
 \u201cGet up
 and do not be afraid.\u201d","When they were coming down from the mountain
 Jesus commanded them
 saying
 \u201cTell the vision to no one until the Son of Man has risen from the dead.\u201d","And He answered and said
 \u201cElijah is coming and will restore all things;","but I say to you that Elijah already came
 and they did not recognize him
 but did to him whatever they wanted. So also the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands.\u201d","And Jesus answered and said
 \u201cYou unbelieving and perverse generation
 how long shall I be with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring him here to Me.\u201d","And He *said to them
 \u201cBecause of your meager faith; for truly I say to you
 if you have faith the size of a mustard seed
 you will say to this mountain
 \u2018Move from here to there
\u2019 and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you.\u201d","And while they were gathering together in Galilee
 Jesus said to them
 \u201cThe Son of Man is going to be handed over to men;","and they will kill Him
 and He will be raised on the third day.\u201d And they were deeply grieved.","He *said
 \u201cYes.\u201d And when he came into the house
 Jesus spoke to him first
 saying
 \u201cWhat do you think
 Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth collect customs or poll-tax
 from their sons or from strangers?\u201d","When Peter said
 \u201cFrom strangers
\u201d Jesus said to him
 \u201cThen the sons are exempt.","However
 so that we do not offend them
 go to the sea and throw in a hook
 and take the first fish that comes up; and when you open its mouth
 you will find a stater. Take that and give it to them for you and Me.\u201d","and said
 \u201cTruly I say to you
 unless you change and become like children
 you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.","So whoever will humble himself like this child
 he is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.","And whoever receives one such child in My name
 receives Me;","but whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to sin
 it is better for him that a heavy millstone be hung around his neck
 and that he be drowned in the depths of the sea.","\u201cWoe to the world because of its stumbling blocks! For it is inevitable that stumbling blocks come; but woe to the person through whom the stumbling block comes!","\u201cAnd if your hand or your foot is causing you to sin
 cut it off and throw it away from you; it is better for you to enter life maimed or without a foot
 than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into the eternal fire.","And if your eye is causing you to sin
 tear it out and throw it away from you. It is better for you to enter life with one eye
 than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fiery hell.","\u201cSee that you do not look down on one of these little ones; for I say to you that their angels in heaven continually see the face of My Father who is in heaven.","\u201cWhat do you think? If any man has a hundred sheep
 and one of them goes astray
 will he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains
 and go and search for the one that is lost?","And if it turns out that he finds it
 truly I say to you
 he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that have not gone astray.","So it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven for one of these little ones to perish.","\u201cNow if your brother sins
 go and show him his fault in private; if he listens to you
 you have gained your brother.","But if he does not listen to you
 take one or two more with you
 so that on the testimony of two or three witnesses every matter may be confirmed.","And if he refuses to listen to them
 tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church
 he is to be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector.","Truly I say to you
 whatever you bind on earth shall have been bound in heaven; and whatever you loose on earth shall have been loosed in heaven.","\u201cAgain I say to you
 that if two of you agree on earth about anything that they may ask
 it shall be done for them by My Father who is in heaven.","For where two or three have gathered together in My name
 I am there in their midst.\u201d","Jesus *said to him
 \u201cI do not say to you
 up to seven times
 but up to seventy-seven times.","\u201cFor this reason the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his slaves.","And when he had begun to settle them
 one who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him.","But since he did not have the means to repay
 his master commanded that he be sold
 along with his wife and children and all that he had
 and repayment be made.","So the slave fell to the ground and prostrated himself before him
 saying
 \u2018Have patience with me and I will repay you everything.\u2019","And the master of that slave felt compassion
 and he released him and forgave him the debt.","But that slave went out and found one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii; and he seized him and began to choke him
 saying
 \u2018Pay back what you owe!\u2019","So his fellow slave fell to the ground and began to plead with him
 saying
 \u2018Have patience with me and I will repay you.\u2019","But he was unwilling
 and went and threw him in prison until he would pay back what was owed.","So when his fellow slaves saw what had happened
 they were deeply grieved and came and reported to their master all that had happened.","Then summoning him
 his master *said to him
 \u2018You wicked slave
 I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me.","Should you not also have had mercy on your fellow slave
 in the same way that I had mercy on you?\u2019","And his master
 moved with anger
 handed him over to the torturers until he would repay all that was owed him.","My heavenly Father will also do the same to you
 if each of you does not forgive his brother from your heart.\u201d","And He answered and said
 \u201cHave you not read that He who created them from the beginning made them male and female
","and said
 \u2018For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother and be joined to his wife
 and the two shall become one flesh\u2019?","So they are no longer two
 but one flesh. Therefore
 what God has joined together
 no person is to separate.\u201d","He *said to them
 \u201cBecause of your hardness of heart Moses permitted you to divorce your wives; but from the beginning it has not been this way.","And I say to you
 whoever divorces his wife
 except for sexual immorality
 and marries another woman commits adultery.\u201d","But He said to them
 \u201cNot all men can accept this statement
 but only those to whom it has been given.","For there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mother\u2019s womb; and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by people; and there are also eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. The one who is able to accept this
 let him accept it.\u201d","But Jesus said
 \u201cLeave the children alone
 and do not forbid them to come to Me; for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.\u201d","And He said to him
 \u201cWhy are you asking Me about what is good? There is only One who is good; but if you want to enter life
 keep the commandments.\u201d","Then he *said to Him
 \u201cWhich ones?\u201d And Jesus said
 \u201cYou shall not commit murder; You shall not commit adultery; You shall not steal; You shall not give false testimony;","Honor your father and mother; and You shall love your neighbor as yourself.\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cIf you want to be complete
 go and sell your possessions and give to the poor
 and you will have treasure in heaven; and come
 follow Me.\u201d","And Jesus said to His disciples
 \u201cTruly I say to you
 it will be hard for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven.","And again I say to you
 it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle
 than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.\u201d","And looking at them
 Jesus said to them
 \u201cWith people this is impossible
 but with God all things are possible.\u201d","And Jesus said to them
 \u201cTruly I say to you
 that you who have followed Me
 in the regeneration when the Son of Man will sit on His glorious throne
 you also shall sit upon twelve thrones
 judging the twelve tribes of Israel.","And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or farms on account of My name
 will receive many times as much
 and will inherit eternal life.","But many who are first will be last; and the last
 first.","\u201cFor the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.","When he had agreed with the laborers for a denarius for the day
 he sent them into his vineyard.","And he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the marketplace;","and to those he said
 \u2018You go into the vineyard also
 and whatever is right
 I will give you.\u2019 And so they went.","Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour
 and did the same thing.","And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing around; and he *said to them
 \u2018Why have you been standing here idle all day long?\u2019","They *said to him
 \u2018Because no one hired us.\u2019 He *said to them
 \u2018You go into the vineyard too.\u2019","\u201cNow when evening came
 the owner of the vineyard *said to his foreman
 \u2018Call the laborers and pay them their wages
 starting with the last group to the first.\u2019","When those hired about the eleventh hour came
 each one received a denarius.","And so when those hired first came
 they thought that they would receive more; but each of them also received a denarius.","When they received it
 they grumbled at the landowner
","saying
 \u2018These who were hired last worked only one hour
 and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the day\u2019s work and the scorching heat.\u2019","But he answered and said to one of them
 \u2018Friend
 I am doing you no wrong; did you not agree with me for a denarius?","Take what is yours and go; but I want to give to this last person the same as to you.","Is it not lawful for me to do what I want with what is my own? Or is your eye envious because I am generous?\u2019","So the last shall be first
 and the first
 last.\u201d","\u201cBehold
 we are going up to Jerusalem
 and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and scribes
 and they will condemn Him to death
","and they will hand Him over to the Gentiles to mock and flog and crucify
 and on the third day He will be raised up.\u201d","And He said to her
 \u201cWhat do you desire?\u201d She *said to Him
 \u201cSay that in Your kingdom these two sons of mine shall sit
 one at Your right
 and one at Your left.\u201d","But Jesus replied
 \u201cYou do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink?\u201d They *said to Him
 \u201cWe are able.\u201d","But Jesus called them to Himself and said
 \u201cYou know that the rulers of the Gentiles domineer over them
 and those in high position exercise authority over them.","It is not this way among you
 but whoever wants to become prominent among you shall be your servant
","and whoever desires to be first among you shall be your slave;","just as the Son of Man did not come to be served
 but to serve
 and to give His life as a ransom for many.\u201d","And Jesus stopped and called them
 and said
 \u201cWhat do you want Me to do for you?\u201d","saying to them
 \u201cGo into the village opposite you
 and immediately you will find a donkey tied there and a colt with it. Untie them and bring them to Me.","And if anyone says anything to you
 you shall say
 \u2018The Lord needs them
\u2019 and he will send them on immediately.\u201d","And He *said to them
 \u201cIt is written: \u2018My house will be called a house of prayer\u2019; but you are making it a den of robbers.\u201d","and they said to Him
 \u201cDo You hear what these children are saying?\u201d And Jesus *said to them
 \u201cYes. Have you never read
 \u2018From the mouths of infants and nursing babies You have prepared praise for Yourself\u2019?\u201d","And seeing a lone fig tree by the road
 He came to it and found nothing on it except leaves alone; and He *said to it
 \u201cNo longer shall there ever be any fruit from you.\u201d And at once the fig tree withered.","And Jesus answered and said to them
 \u201cTruly I say to you
 if you have faith and do not doubt
 you will not only do what was done to the fig tree
 but even if you say to this mountain
 \u2018Be taken up and cast into the sea
\u2019 it will happen.","And whatever you ask in prayer
 believing
 you will receive it all.\u201d","But Jesus responded and said to them
 \u201cI will also ask you one question
 which
 if you tell Me
 I will also tell you by what authority I do these things.","The baptism of John was from what source: from heaven or from men?\u201d And they began considering the implications among themselves
 saying
 \u201cIf we say
 \u2018From heaven
\u2019 He will say to us
 \u2018Then why did you not believe him?\u2019","And answering Jesus
 they said
 \u201cWe do not know.\u201d He also said to them
 \u201cNeither am I telling you by what authority I do these things.","\u201cBut what do you think? A man had two sons
 and he came to the first and said
 \u2018Son
 go work today in the vineyard.\u2019","But he replied
 \u2018I do not want to.\u2019 Yet afterward he regretted it and went.","And the man came to his second son and said the same thing; and he replied
 \u2018I will
 sir\u2019; and yet he did not go.","Which of the two did the will of his father?\u201d They *said
 \u201cThe first.\u201d Jesus *said to them
 \u201cTruly I say to you that the tax collectors and prostitutes will get into the kingdom of God before you.","For John came to you in the way of righteousness and you did not believe him; but the tax collectors and prostitutes did believe him; and you
 seeing this
 did not even have second thoughts afterward so as to believe him.","\u201cListen to another parable. There was a landowner who planted a vineyard and put a fence around it
 and dug a wine press in it
 and built a tower
 and he leased it to vine-growers and went on a journey.","And when the harvest time approached
 he sent his slaves to the vine-growers to receive his fruit.","And the vine-growers took his slaves and beat one
 killed another
 and stoned another.","Again
 he sent other slaves
 more than the first; and they did the same things to them.","But afterward he sent his son to them
 saying
 \u2018They will respect my son.\u2019","But when the vine-growers saw the son
 they said among themselves
 \u2018This is the heir; come
 let\u2019s kill him and take possession of his inheritance!\u2019","And they took him and threw him out of the vineyard
 and killed him.","Therefore
 when the owner of the vineyard comes
 what will he do to those vine-growers?\u201d","They *said to Him
 \u201cHe will bring those wretches to a wretched end and lease the vineyard to other vine-growers
 who will pay him the fruit in the proper seasons.\u201d","Jesus *said to them
 \u201cDid you never read in the Scriptures
 \u2018A stone which the builders rejected
 This has become the chief cornerstone; This came about from the Lord
 And it is marvelous in our eyes\u2019?","Therefore I say to you
 the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people producing its fruit.","And the one who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; and on whomever it falls
 it will crush him.\u201d","\u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like a king who held a wedding feast for his son.","And he sent his slaves to call those who had been invited to the wedding feast
 and they were unwilling to come.","Again he sent other slaves
 saying
 \u2018Tell those who have been invited
 \u201cBehold
 I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and my fattened cattle are all butchered and everything is ready. Come to the wedding feast!\u201d\u2019","But they paid no attention and went their separate ways
 one to his own farm
 another to his business
","and the rest seized his slaves and treated them abusively
 and then killed them.","Now the king was angry
 and he sent his armies and destroyed those murderers and set their city on fire.","Then he *said to his slaves
 \u2018The wedding feast is ready
 but those who were invited were not worthy.","So go to the main roads
 and invite whomever you find there to the wedding feast.\u2019","Those slaves went out into the streets and gathered together all whom they found
 both bad and good; and the wedding hall was filled with dinner guests.","\u201cBut when the king came in to look over the dinner guests
 he saw a man there who was not dressed in wedding clothes
","and he *said to him
 \u2018Friend
 how did you get in here without wedding clothes?\u2019 And the man was speechless.","Then the king said to the servants
 \u2018Tie his hands and feet
 and throw him into the outer darkness; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth in that place.\u2019","For many are called
 but few are chosen.\u201d","But Jesus perceived their malice
 and said
 \u201cWhy are you testing Me
 you hypocrites?","Show Me the coin used for the poll-tax.\u201d And they brought Him a denarius.","And He *said to them
 \u201cWhose image and inscription is this?\u201d","They *said to Him
 \u201cCaesar\u2019s.\u201d Then He *said to them
 \u201cThen pay to Caesar the things that are Caesar\u2019s; and to God the things that are God\u2019s.\u201d","But Jesus answered and said to them
 \u201cYou are mistaken
 since you do not understand the Scriptures nor the power of God.","For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage
 but are like angels in heaven.","But regarding the resurrection of the dead
 have you not read what was spoken to you by God:","\u2018I am the God of Abraham
 the God of Isaac
 and the God of Jacob\u2019? He is not the God of the dead
 but of the living.\u201d","And He said to him
 \u201c\u2018You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart
 and with all your soul
 and with all your mind.\u2019","This is the great and foremost commandment.","The second is like it
 \u2018You shall love your neighbor as yourself.\u2019","Upon these two commandments hang the whole Law and the Prophets.\u201d","\u201cWhat do you think about the Christ? Whose son is He?\u201d They *said to Him
 \u201cThe son of David.\u201d","He *said to them
 \u201cThen how does David in the Spirit call Him \u2018Lord
\u2019 saying
","\u2018The Lord said to my Lord
 \u201cSit at My right hand
 Until I put Your enemies under Your feet\u201d\u2019?","Therefore
 if David calls Him \u2018Lord
\u2019 how is He his son?\u201d","saying: \u201cThe scribes and the Pharisees have seated themselves in the chair of Moses.","Therefore
 whatever they tell you
 do and comply with it all
 but do not do as they do; for they say things and do not do them.","And they tie up heavy burdens and lay them on people\u2019s shoulders
 but they themselves are unwilling to move them with so much as their finger.","And they do all their deeds to be noticed by other people; for they broaden their phylacteries and lengthen the tassels of their garments.","And they love the place of honor at banquets
 and the seats of honor in the synagogues
","and personal greetings in the marketplaces
 and being called Rabbi by the people.","But as for you
 do not be called Rabbi; for only One is your Teacher
 and you are all brothers and sisters.","And do not call anyone on earth your father; for only One is your Father
 He who is in heaven.","And do not be called leaders; for only One is your Leader
 that is
 Christ.","But the greatest of you shall be your servant.","Whoever exalts himself shall be humbled
 and whoever humbles himself shall be exalted.","\u201cBut woe to you
 scribes and Pharisees
 hypocrites
 because you shut the kingdom of heaven in front of people; for you do not enter it yourselves
 nor do you allow those who are entering to go in.","\u201cWoe to you
 scribes and Pharisees
 hypocrites
 because you travel around on sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he becomes one
 you make him twice as much a son of hell as yourselves.","\u201cWoe to you
 blind guides
 who say
 \u2018Whoever swears by the temple
 that is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the temple is obligated.\u2019","You fools and blind men! Which is more important
 the gold or the temple that sanctified the gold?","And you say
 \u2018Whoever swears by the altar
 that is nothing; but whoever swears by the offering that is on it is obligated.\u2019","You blind men
 which is more important
 the offering or the altar that sanctifies the offering?","Therefore
 the one who swears by the altar
 swears both by the altar and by everything on it.","And the one who swears by the temple
 swears both by the temple and by Him who dwells in it.","And the one who swears by heaven
 swears both by the throne of God and by Him who sits upon it.","\u201cWoe to you
 scribes and Pharisees
 hypocrites! For you tithe mint and dill and cumin
 and have neglected the weightier provisions of the Law: justice and mercy and faithfulness; but these are the things you should have done without neglecting the others.","You blind guides
 who strain out a gnat and swallow a camel!","\u201cWoe to you
 scribes and Pharisees
 hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and of the dish
 but inside they are full of robbery and self-indulgence.","You blind Pharisee
 first clean the inside of the cup and of the dish
 so that the outside of it may also become clean.","\u201cWoe to you
 scribes and Pharisees
 hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs which on the outside appear beautiful
 but inside they are full of dead men\u2019s bones and all uncleanness.","So you too
 outwardly appear righteous to people
 but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.","\u201cWoe to you
 scribes and Pharisees
 hypocrites! For you build the tombs for the prophets and decorate the monuments of the righteous
","and you say
 \u2018If we had been living in the days of our fathers
 we would not have been partners with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.\u2019","So you testify against yourselves
 that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets.","Fill up
 then
 the measure of the guilt of your fathers.","You snakes
 you offspring of vipers
 how will you escape the sentence of hell?","\u201cTherefore
 behold
 I am sending you prophets and wise men and scribes; some of them you will kill and crucify
 and some of them you will flog in your synagogues
 and persecute from city to city
","so that upon you will fall the guilt of all the righteous blood shed on earth
 from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah
 the son of Berechiah
 whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.","Truly I say to you
 all these things will come upon this generation.","\u201cJerusalem
 Jerusalem
 who kills the prophets and stones those who have been sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together
 the way a hen gathers her chicks under her wings
 and you were unwilling.","Behold
 your house is being left to you desolate!","For I say to you
 from now on you will not see Me until you say
 \u2018Blessed is the One who comes in the name of the Lord!\u2019\u201d","But He responded and said to them
 \u201cDo you not see all these things? Truly I say to you
 not one stone here will be left upon another
 which will not be torn down.\u201d","And Jesus answered and said to them
 \u201cSee to it that no one misleads you.","For many will come in My name
 saying
 \u2018I am the Christ
\u2019 and they will mislead many people.","And you will be hearing of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not alarmed
 for those things must take place
 but that is not yet the end.","For nation will rise against nation
 and kingdom against kingdom
 and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places.","But all these things are merely the beginning of birth pains.","\u201cThen they will hand you over to tribulation and kill you
 and you will be hated by all nations because of My name.","And at that time many will fall away
 and they will betray one another and hate one another.","And many false prophets will rise up and mislead many people.","And because lawlessness is increased
 most people\u2019s love will become cold.","But the one who endures to the end is the one who will be saved.","This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all the nations
 and then the end will come.","\u201cTherefore when you see the abomination of desolation which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet
 standing in the holy place\u2014let the reader understand\u2014","then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains.","Whoever is on the housetop must not go down to get things out of his house.","And whoever is in the field must not turn back to get his cloak.","But woe to those women who are pregnant
 and to those who are nursing babies in those days!","Moreover
 pray that when you flee
 it will not be in the winter
 or on a Sabbath.","For then there will be a great tribulation
 such as has not occurred since the beginning of the world until now
 nor ever will again.","And if those days had not been cut short
 no life would have been saved; but for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short.","Then if anyone says to you
 \u2018Behold
 here is the Christ
\u2019 or \u2018He is over here
\u2019 do not believe him.","For false christs and false prophets will arise and will provide great signs and wonders
 so as to mislead
 if possible
 even the elect.","Behold
 I have told you in advance.","So if they say to you
 \u2018Behold
 He is in the wilderness
\u2019 do not go out; or
 \u2018Behold
 He is in the inner rooms
\u2019 do not believe them.","For just as the lightning comes from the east and flashes as far as the west
 so will the coming of the Son of Man be.","Wherever the corpse is
 there the vultures will gather.","\u201cBut immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened
 and the moon will not give its light
 and the stars will fall from the sky
 and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.","And then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky
 and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn
 and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with power and great glory.","And He will send forth His angels with a great trumpet blast
 and they will gather together His elect from the four winds
 from one end of the sky to the other.","\u201cNow learn the parable from the fig tree: as soon as its branch has become tender and sprouts its leaves
 you know that summer is near;","so you too
 when you see all these things
 recognize that He is near
 right at the door.","Truly I say to you
 this generation will not pass away until all these things take place.","Heaven and earth will pass away
 but My words will not pass away.","\u201cBut about that day and hour no one knows
 not even the angels of heaven
 nor the Son
 but the Father alone.","For the coming of the Son of Man will be just like the days of Noah.","For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking
 marrying and giving in marriage
 until the day that Noah entered the ark
","and they did not understand until the flood came and took them all away; so will the coming of the Son of Man be.","At that time there will be two men in the field; one will be taken and one will be left.","Two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken and one will be left.","\u201cTherefore be on the alert
 for you do not know which day your Lord is coming.","But be sure of this
 that if the head of the house had known at what time of the night the thief was coming
 he would have been on the alert and would not have allowed his house to be broken into.","For this reason you must be ready as well; for the Son of Man is coming at an hour when you do not think He will.","\u201cWho then is the faithful and sensible slave whom his master put in charge of his household slaves
 to give them their food at the proper time?","Blessed is that slave whom his master finds so doing when he comes.","Truly I say to you that he will put him in charge of all his possessions.","But if that evil slave says in his heart
 \u2018My master is not coming for a long time
\u2019","and he begins to beat his fellow slaves
 and he eats and drinks with those habitually drunk;","then the master of that slave will come on a day that he does not expect
 and at an hour that he does not know
","and he will cut him in two and assign him a place with the hypocrites; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.","\u201cThen the kingdom of heaven will be comparable to ten virgins
 who took their lamps and went out to meet the groom.","Five of them were foolish
 and five were prudent.","For when the foolish took their lamps
 they did not take extra oil with them;","but the prudent ones took oil in flasks with their lamps.","Now while the groom was delaying
 they all became drowsy and began to sleep.","But at midnight there finally was a shout: \u2018Behold
 the groom! Come out to meet him.\u2019","Then all those virgins got up and trimmed their lamps.","But the foolish virgins said to the prudent ones
 \u2018Give us some of your oil
 because our lamps are going out.\u2019","However
 the prudent ones answered
 \u2018No
 there most certainly would not be enough for us and you too; go instead to the merchants and buy some for yourselves.\u2019","But while they were on their way to buy the oil
 the groom came
 and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding feast; and the door was shut.","Yet later
 the other virgins also came
 saying
 \u2018Lord
 lord
 open up for us.\u2019","But he answered
 \u2018Truly I say to you
 I do not know you.\u2019","Be on the alert then
 because you do not know the day nor the hour.","\u201cFor it is just like a man about to go on a journey
 who called his own slaves and entrusted his possessions to them.","To one he gave five talents
 to another
 two
 and to another
 one
 each according to his own ability; and he went on his journey.","The one who had received the five talents immediately went and did business with them
 and earned five more talents.","In the same way the one who had received the two talents earned two more.","But he who received the one talent went away and dug a hole in the ground
 and hid his master\u2019s money.","\u201cNow after a long time the master of those slaves *came and *settled accounts with them.","The one who had received the five talents came up and brought five more talents
 saying
 \u2018Master
 you entrusted five talents to me. See
 I have earned five more talents.\u2019","His master said to him
 \u2018Well done
 good and faithful slave. You were faithful with a few things
 I will put you in charge of many things; enter the joy of your master.\u2019","\u201cAlso the one who had received the two talents came up and said
 \u2018Master
 you entrusted two talents to me. See
 I have earned two more talents.\u2019","His master said to him
 \u2018Well done
 good and faithful slave. You were faithful with a few things
 I will put you in charge of many things; enter the joy of your master.\u2019","\u201cNow the one who had received the one talent also came up and said
 \u2018Master
 I knew you to be a hard man
 reaping where you did not sow
 and gathering where you did not scatter seed.","And I was afraid
 so I went away and hid your talent in the ground. See
 you still have what is yours.\u2019","\u201cBut his master answered and said to him
 \u2018You worthless
 lazy slave! Did you know that I reap where I did not sow
 and gather where I did not scatter seed?","Then you ought to have put my money in the bank
 and on my arrival I would have received my money back with interest.","Therefore: take the talent away from him
 and give it to the one who has the ten talents.\u2019","\u201cFor to everyone who has
 more shall be given
 and he will have an abundance; but from the one who does not have
 even what he does have shall be taken away.","And throw the worthless slave into the outer darkness; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.","\u201cBut when the Son of Man comes in His glory
 and all the angels with Him
 then He will sit on His glorious throne.","And all the nations will be gathered before Him; and He will separate them from one another
 just as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats;","and He will put the sheep on His right
 but the goats on the left.","\u201cThen the King will say to those on His right
 \u2018Come
 you who are blessed of My Father
 inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.","For I was hungry
 and you gave Me something to eat; I was thirsty
 and you gave Me something to drink; I was a stranger
 and you invited Me in;","naked
 and you clothed Me; I was sick
 and you visited Me; I was in prison

 or thirsty
 and give You something to drink?","And when did we see You as a stranger
 and invite You in
 or naked
 and clothe You?","And when did we see You sick
 or in prison
 and come to You?\u2019","And the King will answer and say to them
 \u2018Truly I say to you
 to the extent that you did it for one of the least of these brothers or sisters of Mine
 you did it for Me.\u2019","\u201cThen He will also say to those on His left
 \u2018Depart from Me
 you accursed people
 into the eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels;","for I was hungry
 and you gave Me nothing to eat; I was thirsty
 and you gave Me nothing to drink;","I was a stranger
 and you did not invite Me in; naked
 and you did not clothe Me; sick
 and in prison
 and you did not visit Me.\u2019","Then they themselves also will answer
 \u2018Lord
 when did we see You hungry
 or thirsty
 or as a stranger
 or naked
 or sick
 or in prison
 and did not take care of You?\u2019","Then He will answer them
 \u2018Truly I say to you
 to the extent that you did not do it for one of the least of these
 you did not do it for Me
 either.\u2019","These will go away into eternal punishment

 and the Son of Man is to be handed over for crucifixion.\u201d","But Jesus
 aware of this

 \u201cWhy are you bothering the woman? For she has done a good deed for Me.","For you always have the poor with you; but you do not always have Me.","For when she poured this perfume on My body
 she did it to prepare Me for burial.","Truly I say to you

 He said
 \u201cTruly I say to you that one of you will betray Me.\u201d","And He answered
 \u201cHe who dipped his hand with Me in the bowl is the one who will betray Me.","The Son of Man is going away just as it is written about Him; but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been good for that man if he had not been born.\u201d","And Judas
 who was betraying Him

 He broke it and gave it to the disciples

 \u201cTake
 eat; this is My body.\u201d","And when He had taken a cup and given thanks
 He gave it to them

 \u201cDrink from it

 I will go ahead of you to Galilee.\u201d","Jesus said to him

 you men could not keep watch with Me for one hour?","Keep watching and praying
 so that you do not come into temptation; the spirit is willing
 but the flesh is weak.\u201d","He went away again a second time and prayed
 saying
 \u201cMy Father
 if this cup cannot pass away unless I drink from it
 Your will be done.\u201d","Then He *came to the disciples and *said to them
 \u201cAre you still sleeping and resting? Behold
 the hour is at hand and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.","Get up
 let\u2019s go; behold
 the one who is betraying Me is near!\u201d","But Jesus said to him
 \u201cFriend
 do what you have come for.\u201d Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and arrested Him.","Then Jesus *said to him
 \u201cPut your sword back into its place; for all those who take up the sword will perish by the sword.","Or do you think that I cannot appeal to My Father
 and He will at once put at My disposal more than twelve legions of angels?","How then would the Scriptures be fulfilled
 which say that it must happen this way?\u201d","At that time Jesus said to the crowds
 \u201cHave you come out with swords and clubs to arrest Me as you would against a man inciting a revolt? Every day I used to sit within the temple grounds teaching
 and you did not arrest Me.","But all this has taken place so that the Scriptures of the prophets will be fulfilled.\u201d Then all the disciples left Him and fled.","Jesus *said to him
 \u201cYou have said it yourself. But I tell you
 from now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of power
 and coming on the clouds of heaven.\u201d","And Peter remembered the statement that Jesus had made: \u201cBefore a rooster crows
 you will deny Me three times.\u201d And he went out and wept bitterly.","Now Jesus stood before the governor
 and the governor questioned Him
 saying
 \u201cSo You are the King of the Jews?\u201d And Jesus said to him
 \u201cIt is as you say.\u201d","And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice
 saying
 \u201cEli

 why have You forsaken Me?\u201d","And behold
 Jesus met them and said
 \u201cRejoice!\u201d And they came up and took hold of His feet
 and worshiped Him.","Then Jesus *said to them
 \u201cDo not be afraid; go
 bring word to My brothers to leave for Galilee

 \u201cAll authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me.","Go
 therefore

 I am with you always
 to the end of the age.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cLet it be this way for now. We should do all things that are God\u2019s will.\u201d So John agreed to baptize Jesus.","Jesus answered
 \u201cIt is written in the Scriptures

 saying
 \u201cChange your hearts and lives

 \u201cCome follow me
 and I will make you fish for people.\u201d ","\u201cThey are blessed who realize their spiritual poverty

 for God will comfort them.","They are blessed who are humble
 for the whole earth will be theirs.","They are blessed who hunger and thirst after justice
 for they will be satisfied.","They are blessed who show mercy to others
 for God will show mercy to them.","They are blessed whose thoughts are pure
 for they will see God.","They are blessed who work for peace

 for the kingdom of heaven belongs to them.","\u201cPeople will insult you and hurt you. They will lie and say all kinds of evil things about you because you follow me. But when they do
 you will be blessed. ","Rejoice and be glad
 because you have a great reward waiting for you in heaven. People did the same evil things to the prophets who lived before you.","\u201cYou are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its salty taste
 it cannot be made salty again. It is good for nothing
 except to be thrown out and walked on.","\u201cYou are the light that gives light to the world. A city that is built on a hill cannot be hidden.","And people don\u2019t hide a light under a bowl. They put it on a lampstand so the light shines for all the people in the house.","In the same way
 you should be a light for other people. Live so that they will see the good things you do and will praise your Father in heaven.","\u201cDon\u2019t think that I have come to destroy the law of Moses or the teaching of the prophets. I have not come to destroy them but to bring about what they said.","I tell you the truth
 nothing will disappear from the law until heaven and earth are gone. Not even the smallest letter or the smallest part of a letter will be lost until everything has happened. ","Whoever refuses to obey any command and teaches other people not to obey that command will be the least important in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever obeys the commands and teaches other people to obey them will be great in the kingdom of heaven.","I tell you that if you are no more obedient than the teachers of the law and the Pharisees
 you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.","\u201cYou have heard that it was said to our people long ago
 \u2018You must not murder anyone. Anyone who murders another will be judged.\u2019 ","But I tell you
 if you are angry with a brother or sister
 you will be judged. If you say bad things to a brother or sister
 you will be judged by the council. And if you call someone a fool
 you will be in danger of the fire of hell.","\u201cSo when you offer your gift to God at the altar
 and you remember that your brother or sister has something against you
 ","leave your gift there at the altar. Go and make peace with that person
 and then come and offer your gift.","\u201cIf your enemy is taking you to court
 become friends quickly
 before you go to court. Otherwise

 and the judge might give you to a guard to put you in jail. ","I tell you the truth
 you will not leave there until you have paid everything you owe.","\u201cYou have heard that it was said
 \u2018You must not be guilty of adultery.\u2019 ","But I tell you that if anyone looks at a woman and wants to sin sexually with her
 in his mind he has already done that sin with the woman. ","If your right eye causes you to sin
 take it out and throw it away. It is better to lose one part of your body than to have your whole body thrown into hell. ","If your right hand causes you to sin
 cut it off and throw it away. It is better to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell.","\u201cIt was also said
 \u2018Anyone who divorces his wife must give her a written divorce paper.\u2019 ","But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife forces her to be guilty of adultery. The only reason for a man to divorce his wife is if she has sexual relations with another man. And anyone who marries that divorced woman is guilty of adultery.","\u201cYou have heard that it was said to our people long ago
 \u2018Don\u2019t break your promises
 but keep the promises you make to the Lord.\u2019 ","But I tell you
 never swear an oath. Don\u2019t swear an oath using the name of heaven

 because the earth belongs to God. Don\u2019t swear an oath using the name of Jerusalem
 because that is the city of the great King. ","Don\u2019t even swear by your own head
 because you cannot make one hair on your head become white or black. ","Say only yes if you mean yes
 and no if you mean no. If you say more than yes or no
 it is from the Evil One.","\u201cYou have heard that it was said
 \u2018An eye for an eye

 don\u2019t stand up against an evil person. If someone slaps you on the right cheek
 turn to him the other cheek also. ","If someone wants to sue you in court and take your shirt

 go with him two miles. ","If a person asks you for something

 \u2018Love your neighbor and hate your enemies.\u2019 ","But I say to you
 love your enemies. Pray for those who hurt you. ","If you do this
 you will be true children of your Father in heaven. He causes the sun to rise on good people and on evil people

 you will get no reward. Even the tax collectors do that. ","And if you are nice only to your friends
 you are no better than other people. Even those who don\u2019t know God are nice to their friends. ","So you must be perfect
 just as your Father in heaven is perfect.","\u201cBe careful! When you do good things
 don\u2019t do them in front of people to be seen by them. If you do that
 you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.","\u201cWhen you give to the poor
 don\u2019t be like the hypocrites. They blow trumpets in the synagogues and on the streets so that people will see them and honor them. I tell you the truth
 those hypocrites already have their full reward. ","So when you give to the poor
 don\u2019t let anyone know what you are doing. ","Your giving should be done in secret. Your Father can see what is done in secret
 and he will reward you.","\u201cWhen you pray
 don\u2019t be like the hypocrites. They love to stand in the synagogues and on the street corners and pray so people will see them. I tell you the truth
 they already have their full reward. ","When you pray
 you should go into your room and close the door and pray to your Father who cannot be seen. Your Father can see what is done in secret
 and he will reward you.","\u201cAnd when you pray
 don\u2019t be like those people who don\u2019t know God. They continue saying things that mean nothing
 thinking that God will hear them because of their many words. ","Don\u2019t be like them
 because your Father knows the things you need before you ask him. ","So when you pray
 you should pray like this: \u2018Our Father in heaven
 may your name always be kept holy.","May your kingdom come and what you want be done
 here on earth as it is in heaven.","Give us the food we need for each day.","Forgive us for our sins
 just as we have forgiven those who sinned against us.","And do not cause us to be tempted
 but save us from the Evil One.\u2019 [The kingdom
 the power

 if you forgive others for their sins
 your Father in heaven will also forgive you for your sins. ","But if you don\u2019t forgive others
 your Father in heaven will not forgive your sins.","\u201cWhen you fast
 don\u2019t put on a sad face like the hypocrites. They make their faces look sad to show people they are fasting. I tell you the truth
 those hypocrites already have their full reward. ","So when you fast
 comb your hair and wash your face. ","Then people will not know that you are fasting
 but your Father
 whom you cannot see
 will see you. Your Father sees what is done in secret
 and he will reward you.","\u201cDon\u2019t store treasures for yourselves here on earth where moths and rust will destroy them and thieves can break in and steal them.","But store your treasures in heaven where they cannot be destroyed by moths or rust and where thieves cannot break in and steal them.","Your heart will be where your treasure is.","\u201cThe eye is a light for the body. If your eyes are good
 your whole body will be full of light. ","But if your eyes are evil
 your whole body will be full of darkness. And if the only light you have is really darkness
 then you have the worst darkness.","\u201cNo one can serve two masters. The person will hate one master and love the other
 or will follow one master and refuse to follow the other. You cannot serve both God and worldly riches.","\u201cSo I tell you
 don\u2019t worry about the food or drink you need to live
 or about the clothes you need for your body. Life is more than food
 and the body is more than clothes. ","Look at the birds in the air. They don\u2019t plant or harvest or store food in barns
 but your heavenly Father feeds them. And you know that you are worth much more than the birds. ","You cannot add any time to your life by worrying about it.","\u201cAnd why do you worry about clothes? Look at how the lilies in the field grow. They don\u2019t work or make clothes for themselves.","But I tell you that even Solomon with his riches was not dressed as beautifully as one of these flowers.","God clothes the grass in the field
 which is alive today but tomorrow is thrown into the fire. So you can be even more sure that God will clothe you. Don\u2019t have so little faith! ","Don\u2019t worry and say
 \u2018What will we eat?\u2019 or \u2018What will we drink?\u2019 or \u2018What will we wear?\u2019 ","The people who don\u2019t know God keep trying to get these things
 and your Father in heaven knows you need them. ","Seek first God\u2019s kingdom and what God wants. Then all your other needs will be met as well.","So don\u2019t worry about tomorrow
 because tomorrow will have its own worries. Each day has enough trouble of its own.","\u201cDon\u2019t judge others
 or you will be judged. ","You will be judged in the same way that you judge others
 and the amount you give to others will be given to you.","\u201cWhy do you notice the little piece of dust in your friend\u2019s eye
 but you don\u2019t notice the big piece of wood in your own eye? ","How can you say to your friend
 \u2018Let me take that little piece of dust out of your eye\u2019? Look at yourself! You still have that big piece of wood in your own eye. ","You hypocrite! First
 take the wood out of your own eye. Then you will see clearly to take the dust out of your friend\u2019s eye.","\u201cDon\u2019t give holy things to dogs
 and don\u2019t throw your pearls before pigs. Pigs will only trample on them
 and dogs will turn to attack you.","\u201cAsk
 and God will give to you. Search
 and you will find. Knock
 and the door will open for you. ","Yes
 everyone who asks will receive. Everyone who searches will find. And everyone who knocks will have the door opened.","\u201cIf your children ask for bread
 which of you would give them a stone? ","Or if your children ask for a fish
 would you give them a snake? ","Even though you are bad
 you know how to give good gifts to your children. How much more your heavenly Father will give good things to those who ask him!","\u201cDo to others what you want them to do to you. This is the meaning of the law of Moses and the teaching of the prophets.","\u201cEnter through the narrow gate. The gate is wide and the road is wide that leads to hell
 and many people enter through that gate. ","But the gate is small and the road is narrow that leads to true life. Only a few people find that road.","\u201cBe careful of false prophets. They come to you looking gentle like sheep
 but they are really dangerous like wolves. ","You will know these people by what they do. Grapes don\u2019t come from thornbushes
 and figs don\u2019t come from thorny weeds. ","In the same way
 every good tree produces good fruit
 but a bad tree produces bad fruit. ","A good tree cannot produce bad fruit
 and a bad tree cannot produce good fruit. ","Every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.","In the same way
 you will know these false prophets by what they do.","\u201cNot all those who say \u2018You are our Lord\u2019 will enter the kingdom of heaven. The only people who will enter the kingdom of heaven are those who do what my Father in heaven wants.","On the last day many people will say to me
 \u2018Lord

 and through you we forced out demons and did many miracles.\u2019 ","Then I will tell them clearly
 \u2018Get away from me
 you who do evil. I never knew you.\u2019","\u201cEveryone who hears my words and obeys them is like a wise man who built his house on rock.","It rained hard

 the floods came
 and the winds blew and hit that house
 and it fell with a big crash.\u201d","Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man and said
 \u201cI will. Be healed!\u201d And immediately the man was healed from his disease. ","Then Jesus said to him
 \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone about this. But go and show yourself to the priest and offer the gift Moses commanded for people who are made well. This will show the people what I have done.\u201d","Jesus said to the officer
 \u201cI will go and heal him.\u201d","When Jesus heard this
 he was amazed. He said to those who were following him
 \u201cI tell you the truth
 this is the greatest faith I have found
 even in Israel. ","Many people will come from the east and from the west and will sit and eat with Abraham
 Isaac
 and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. ","But those people who should be in the kingdom will be thrown outside into the darkness
 where people will cry and grind their teeth with pain.\u201d","Then Jesus said to the officer
 \u201cGo home. Your servant will be healed just as you believed he would.\u201d And his servant was healed that same hour.","Jesus said to him
 \u201cThe foxes have holes to live in
 and the birds have nests

 \u201cFollow me

 \u201cGo!\u201d So the demons left the men and went into the pigs. Then the whole herd rushed down the hill into the lake and were drowned. ","Some people brought to Jesus a man who was paralyzed and lying on a mat. When Jesus saw the faith of these people
 he said to the paralyzed man
 \u201cBe encouraged

 \u201cWhy are you thinking evil thoughts? ","Which is easier: to say
 \u2018Your sins are forgiven
\u2019 or to tell him
 \u2018Stand up and walk\u2019? ","But I will prove to you that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.\u201d Then Jesus said to the paralyzed man
 \u201cStand up
 take your mat
 and go home.\u201d ","When Jesus was leaving
 he saw a man named Matthew sitting in the tax collector\u2019s booth. Jesus said to him
 \u201cFollow me

 he said
 \u201cIt is not the healthy people who need a doctor
 but the sick. ","Go and learn what this means: \u2018I want kindness more than I want animal sacrifices.\u2019 I did not come to invite good people but to invite sinners.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cThe friends of the bridegroom are not sad while he is with them. But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them
 and then they will fast.","\u201cNo one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth over a hole in an old coat. If he does

 and you will find rest for your lives. ","The burden that I ask you to accept is easy; the load I give you to carry is light.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cHave you not read what David did when he and the people with him were hungry? ","He went into God\u2019s house
 and he and those with him ate the holy bread
 which was lawful only for priests to eat. ","And have you not read in the law of Moses that on every Sabbath day the priests in the Temple break this law about the Sabbath day? But the priests are not wrong for doing that.","I tell you that there is something here that is greater than the Temple.","The Scripture says
 \u2018I want kindness more than I want animal sacrifices.\u2019 You don\u2019t really know what those words mean. If you understood them
 you would not judge those who have done nothing wrong.","\u201cSo the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath day.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cIf any of you has a sheep
 and it falls into a ditch on the Sabbath day
 you will help it out of the ditch. ","Surely a human being is more important than a sheep. So it is lawful to do good things on the Sabbath day.\u201d","Then Jesus said to the man with the crippled hand
 \u201cHold out your hand.\u201d The man held out his hand
 and it became well again
 like the other hand. ","Jesus knew what the Pharisees were thinking
 so he said to them
 \u201cEvery kingdom that is divided against itself will be destroyed. And any city or family that is divided against itself will not continue. ","And if Satan forces out himself
 then Satan is divided against himself
 and his kingdom will not continue. ","You say that I use the power of Beelzebul to force out demons. If that is true
 then what power do your people use to force out demons? So they will be your judges. ","But if I use the power of God\u2019s Spirit to force out demons
 then the kingdom of God has come to you.","\u201cIf anyone wants to enter a strong person\u2019s house and steal his things
 he must first tie up the strong person. Then he can steal the things from the house.","\u201cWhoever is not with me is against me. Whoever does not work with me is working against me.","So I tell you
 people can be forgiven for every sin and everything they say against God. But whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. ","Anyone who speaks against the Son of Man can be forgiven
 but anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven
 now or in the future.","\u201cIf you want good fruit
 you must make the tree good. If your tree is not good
 it will have bad fruit. A tree is known by the kind of fruit it produces. ","You snakes! You are evil people
 so how can you say anything good? The mouth speaks the things that are in the heart. ","Good people have good things in their hearts
 and so they say good things. But evil people have evil in their hearts
 so they say evil things. ","And I tell you that on the Judgment Day people will be responsible for every careless thing they have said.","The words you have said will be used to judge you. Some of your words will prove you right
 but some of your words will prove you guilty.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cEvil and sinful people are the ones who want to see a miracle for a sign. But no sign will be given to them
 except the sign of the prophet Jonah. ","Jonah was in the stomach of the big fish for three days and three nights. In the same way
 the Son of Man will be in the grave three days and three nights. ","On the Judgment Day the people from Nineveh will stand up with you people who live now
 and they will show that you are guilty. When Jonah preached to them
 they were sorry and changed their lives. And I tell you that someone greater than Jonah is here. ","On the Judgment Day
 the Queen of the South will stand up with you people who live today. She will show that you are guilty
 because she came from far away to listen to Solomon\u2019s wise teaching. And I tell you that someone greater than Solomon is here.","\u201cWhen an evil spirit comes out of a person
 it travels through dry places
 looking for a place to rest
 but it doesn\u2019t find it. ","So the spirit says
 \u2018I will go back to the house I left.\u2019 When the spirit comes back
 it finds the house still empty
 swept clean
 and made neat. ","Then the evil spirit goes out and brings seven other spirits even more evil than it is
 and they go in and live there. So the person has even more trouble than before. It is the same way with the evil people who live today.\u201d","While Jesus was talking to the people
 his mother and brothers stood outside
 trying to find a way to talk to him. ","He answered
 \u201cWho is my mother? Who are my brothers?\u201d ","Then he pointed to his followers and said
 \u201cHere are my mother and my brothers. ","My true brother and sister and mother are those who do what my Father in heaven wants.\u201d","Then Jesus used stories to teach them many things. He said: \u201cA farmer went out to plant his seed.","While he was planting
 some seed fell by the road
 and the birds came and ate it all up. ","Some seed fell on rocky ground
 where there wasn\u2019t much dirt. That seed grew very fast
 because the ground was not deep. ","But when the sun rose
 the plants dried up
 because they did not have deep roots. ","Some other seed fell among thorny weeds
 which grew and choked the good plants. ","Some other seed fell on good ground where it grew and produced a crop. Some plants made a hundred times more
 some made sixty times more
 and some made thirty times more. ","Let those with ears use them and listen.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cYou have been chosen to know the secrets about the kingdom of heaven
 but others cannot know these secrets. ","Those who have understanding will be given more
 and they will have all they need. But those who do not have understanding
 even what they have will be taken away from them. ","This is why I use stories to teach the people: They see
 but they don\u2019t really see. They hear
 but they don\u2019t really hear or understand. ","So they show that the things Isaiah said about them are true: \u2018You will listen and listen
 but you will not understand. You will look and look
 but you will not learn.","For the minds of these people have become stubborn. They do not hear with their ears
 and they have closed their eyes. Otherwise they might really understand what they see with their eyes and hear with their ears. They might really understand in their minds and come back to me and be healed.\u2019 Isaiah 6:9\u201310","But you are blessed
 because you see with your eyes and hear with your ears. ","I tell you the truth
 many prophets and good people wanted to see the things that you now see
 but they did not see them. And they wanted to hear the things that you now hear
 but they did not hear them.","\u201cSo listen to the meaning of that story about the farmer.","What is the seed that fell by the road? That seed is like the person who hears the message about the kingdom but does not understand it. The Evil One comes and takes away what was planted in that person\u2019s heart.","And what is the seed that fell on rocky ground? That seed is like the person who hears the teaching and quickly accepts it with joy.","But he does not let the teaching go deep into his life
 so he keeps it only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the teaching he accepted
 he quickly gives up. ","And what is the seed that fell among the thorny weeds? That seed is like the person who hears the teaching but lets worries about this life and the temptation of wealth stop that teaching from growing. So the teaching does not produce fruit in that person\u2019s life.","But what is the seed that fell on the good ground? That seed is like the person who hears the teaching and understands it. That person grows and produces fruit
 sometimes a hundred times more
 sometimes sixty times more
 and sometimes thirty times more.\u201d","Then Jesus told them another story: \u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like a man who planted good seed in his field.","That night
 when everyone was asleep
 his enemy came and planted weeds among the wheat and then left. ","Later
 the wheat sprouted and the heads of grain grew
 but the weeds also grew. ","Then the man\u2019s servants came to him and said
 \u2018You planted good seed in your field. Where did the weeds come from?\u2019 ","The man answered
 \u2018An enemy planted weeds.\u2019 The servants asked
 \u2018Do you want us to pull up the weeds?\u2019 ","The man answered
 \u2018No
 because when you pull up the weeds
 you might also pull up the wheat. ","Let the weeds and the wheat grow together until the harvest time. At harvest time I will tell the workers
 \u201cFirst gather the weeds and tie them together to be burned. Then gather the wheat and bring it to my barn.\u201d\u2019\u201d","Then Jesus told another story: \u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that a man planted in his field.","That seed is the smallest of all seeds
 but when it grows
 it is one of the largest garden plants. It becomes big enough for the wild birds to come and build nests in its branches.\u201d","Then Jesus told another story: \u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and hid in a large tub of flour until it made all the dough rise.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cThe man who planted the good seed in the field is the Son of Man. ","The field is the world
 and the good seed are all of God\u2019s children who belong to the kingdom. The weeds are those people who belong to the Evil One. ","And the enemy who planted the bad seed is the devil. The harvest time is the end of the age
 and the workers who gather are God\u2019s angels.","\u201cJust as the weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire
 so it will be at the end of the age. ","The Son of Man will send out his angels
 and they will gather out of his kingdom all who cause sin and all who do evil. ","The angels will throw them into the blazing furnace
 where the people will cry and grind their teeth with pain. ","Then the good people will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Let those with ears use them and listen.","\u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field. One day a man found the treasure
 and then he hid it in the field again. He was so happy that he went and sold everything he owned to buy that field.","\u201cAlso
 the kingdom of heaven is like a man looking for fine pearls. ","When he found a very valuable pearl
 he went and sold everything he had and bought it.","\u201cAlso
 the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was put into the lake and caught many different kinds of fish. ","When it was full
 the fishermen pulled the net to the shore. They sat down and put all the good fish in baskets and threw away the bad fish. ","It will be this way at the end of the age. The angels will come and separate the evil people from the good people.","The angels will throw the evil people into the blazing furnace
 where people will cry and grind their teeth with pain.\u201d","Jesus asked his followers
 \u201cDo you understand all these things?\u201d They answered
 \u201cYes
 we understand.\u201d","Then Jesus said to them
 \u201cSo every teacher of the law who has been taught about the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house. He brings out both new things and old things he has saved.\u201d","So the people were upset with Jesus. But Jesus said to them

 \u2018Honor your father and your mother
\u2019 and \u2018Anyone who says cruel things to his father or mother must be put to death.\u2019 ","But you say a person can tell his father or mother
 \u2018I have something I could use to help you

He\u2019s a friend of tax collectors and \u201csinners.\u201d\u2009\u2019 By wise actions wisdom is shown to be right.\u201d","Jesus began to speak against the towns where he had done most of his miracles. The people there had not turned away from their sins. So he said
 ","\u201cHow terrible it will be for you
 Chorazin! How terrible for you
 Bethsaida! Suppose the miracles done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon. They would have turned away from their sins long ago. They would have put on clothes for mourning. They would have sat down in ashes. ","But I tell you this. On judgment day it will be easier for Tyre and Sidon than for you.","And what about you
 Capernaum? Will you be lifted to the heavens? No! You will go down to the place of the dead. Suppose the miracles done in you had been done in Sodom. It would still be here today. ","But I tell you this. On judgment day it will be easier for Sodom than for you.\u201d","At that time Jesus said
 \u201cI praise you
 Father. You are Lord of heaven and earth. You have hidden these things from wise and educated people. But you have shown them to little children. ","Yes
 Father. This is what you wanted to do.","\u201cMy Father has given all things to me. The Father is the only one who knows the Son. And the only ones who know the Father are the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to make him known.","\u201cCome to me
 all you who are tired and are carrying heavy loads. I will give you rest. ","Become my servants and learn from me. I am gentle and free of pride. You will find rest for your souls.","Serving me is easy
 and my load is light.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cHaven\u2019t you read about what David did? He and his men were hungry. ","So he entered the house of God. He and his men ate the holy bread. Only priests were allowed to eat it.","Haven\u2019t you read the Law? It tells how every Sabbath day the priests in the temple have to do their work on that day. But they are not considered guilty.","I tell you that something more important than the temple is here.","Scripture says
 \u2018I want mercy and not sacrifice.\u2019 (Hosea 6:6) You don\u2019t know what those words mean. If you did
 you would not bring charges against those who are not guilty. ","The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath day.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cWhat if one of your sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath day? Won\u2019t you take hold of it and lift it out? ","A person is worth more than sheep! So the Law allows us to do good on the Sabbath day.\u201d","Then Jesus said to the man
 \u201cStretch out your hand.\u201d So he stretched it out. It had been made as good as new. It was just as good as the other hand. ","Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he said to them
 \u201cEvery kingdom that fights against itself will be destroyed. Every city or family that is divided against itself will not stand. ","If Satan drives out Satan
 he fights against himself. Then how can his kingdom stand? ","You say I drive out demons by the power of Beelzebul. Then by whose power do your people drive them out? So then
 they will be your judges. ","But suppose I drive out demons by the Spirit of God. Then the kingdom of God has come to you.","\u201cOr think about this. How can you enter a strong man\u2019s house and just take what the man owns? You must first tie him up. Then you can rob his house.","\u201cAnyone who is not with me is against me. Anyone who does not gather sheep with me scatters them.","So here is what I tell you. Every kind of sin and every evil word spoken against God will be forgiven. But speaking evil things against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.","Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven. But anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. A person like that won\u2019t be forgiven either now or in days to come.","\u201cIf you make a tree good
 its fruit will be good. If you make a tree bad
 its fruit will be bad. You can tell a tree by its fruit. ","You nest of poisonous snakes! How can you who are evil say anything good? Your mouths say everything that is in your hearts.","A good man says good things. These come from the good that is stored up inside him. An evil man says evil things. These come from the evil that is stored up inside him.","But here is what I tell you. On judgment day
 everyone will have to account for every empty word they have spoken. ","By your words you will be found guilty or not guilty.\u201d","He answered
 \u201cEvil and unfaithful people ask for a sign! But none will be given except the sign of the prophet Jonah. ","Jonah was in the belly of a huge fish for three days and three nights. Something like that will happen to the Son of Man. He will spend three days and three nights in the grave.","The men of Nineveh will stand up on judgment day with the people now living. And the Ninevites will prove that these people are guilty. The men of Nineveh turned away from their sins when Jonah preached to them. And now something more important than Jonah is here.","The Queen of the South will stand up on judgment day with the people now living. And she will prove that they are guilty. She came from very far away to listen to Solomon\u2019s wisdom. And now something more important than Solomon is here.","\u201cWhat happens when an evil spirit comes out of a person? It goes through dry areas looking for a place to rest. But it doesn\u2019t find it.","Then it says
 \u2018I will return to the house I left.\u2019 When it arrives there
 it finds the house empty. The house has been swept clean and put in order. ","Then the evil spirit goes and takes with it seven other spirits more evil than itself. They go in and live there. That person is worse off than before. That is how it will be with the evil people of today.\u201d","While Jesus was still talking to the crowd
 his mother and brothers stood outside. They wanted to speak to him. ","Jesus replied to him
 \u201cWho is my mother? And who are my brothers?\u201d ","Jesus pointed to his disciples. He said
 \u201cHere is my mother! Here are my brothers! ","Anyone who does what my Father in heaven wants is my brother or sister or mother.\u201d","Then he told them many things using stories. He said
 \u201cA farmer went out to plant his seed. ","He scattered the seed on the ground. Some fell on a path. Birds came and ate it up.","Some seed fell on rocky places
 where there wasn\u2019t much soil. The plants came up quickly
 because the soil wasn\u2019t deep. ","When the sun came up
 it burned the plants. They dried up because they had no roots. ","Other seed fell among thorns. The thorns grew up and crowded out the plants.","Still other seed fell on good soil. It produced a crop 100
 60 or 30 times more than what was planted. ","Whoever has ears should listen.\u201d","He replied
 \u201cBecause you have been given the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven. It has not been given to outsiders. ","Everyone who has this kind of knowledge will be given more knowledge. In fact
 they will have very much. If anyone doesn\u2019t have this kind of knowledge
 even what little they have will be taken away from them. ","Here is why I use stories when I speak to the people. I say
 \u201cThey look
 but they don\u2019t really see. They listen
 but they don\u2019t really hear or understand.","In them the words of the prophet Isaiah come true. He said
 \u201c\u2009\u2018You will hear but never understand. You will see but never know what you are seeing.","The hearts of these people have become stubborn. They can barely hear with their ears. They have closed their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes. They might hear with their ears. They might understand with their hearts. They might turn to the Lord
 and then he would heal them.\u2019 (Isaiah 6:9
10)","But blessed are your eyes because they see. And blessed are your ears because they hear.","What I\u2019m about to tell you is true. Many prophets and godly people wanted to see what you see. But they didn\u2019t see it. They wanted to hear what you hear. But they didn\u2019t hear it.","\u201cListen! Here is the meaning of the story of the farmer.","People hear the message about the kingdom but do not understand it. Then the evil one comes. He steals what was planted in their hearts. Those people are like the seed planted on a path.","The seed that fell on rocky places is like other people. They hear the message and at once receive it with joy.","But they have no roots. So they last only a short time. They quickly fall away from the faith when trouble or suffering comes because of the message.","The seed that fell among the thorns is like others who hear the message. But then the worries of this life and the false promises of wealth crowd it out. They keep the message from producing fruit.","But the seed that fell on good soil is like those who hear the message and understand it. They produce a crop 100
 60 or 30 times more than the farmer planted.\u201d","Jesus told the crowd another story. \u201cHere is what the kingdom of heaven is like
\u201d he said. \u201cA man planted good seed in his field. ","But while everyone was sleeping
 his enemy came. The enemy planted weeds among the wheat and then went away. ","The wheat began to grow and form grain. At the same time
 weeds appeared.","\u201cThe owner\u2019s slaves came to him. They said
 \u2018Sir
 didn\u2019t you plant good seed in your field? Then where did the weeds come from?\u2019","\u201c\u2009\u2018An enemy did this
\u2019 he replied. \u201cThe slaves asked him
 \u2018Do you want us to go and pull up the weeds?\u2019","\u201c\u2009\u2018No
\u2019 the owner answered. \u2018While you are pulling up the weeds
 you might pull up the wheat with them. ","Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the workers what to do. Here is what I will say to them. First collect the weeds. Tie them in bundles to be burned. Then gather the wheat. Bring it into my storeroom.\u2019\u2009\u201d","Jesus told the crowd another story. He said
 \u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed. Someone took the seed and planted it in a field. ","It is the smallest of all seeds. But when it grows
 it is the largest of all garden plants. It becomes a tree. Birds come and rest in its branches.\u201d","Jesus told them still another story. \u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like yeast
\u201d he said. \u201cA woman mixed it into 60 pounds of flour. The yeast worked its way all through the dough.\u201d","He answered
 \u201cThe one who planted the good seed is the Son of Man. ","The field is the world. The good seed stands for the people who belong to the kingdom. The weeds are the people who belong to the evil one.","The enemy who plants them is the devil. The harvest is judgment day. And the workers are angels.","\u201cThe weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire. That is how it will be on judgment day.","The Son of Man will send out his angels. They will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin. They will also get rid of all who do evil.","They will throw them into the blazing furnace. There people will weep and grind their teeth.","Then God\u2019s people will shine like the sun in their Father\u2019s kingdom. Whoever has ears should listen.","\u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like treasure that was hidden in a field. When a man found it
 he hid it again. He was very happy. So he went and sold everything he had. And he bought that field.","\u201cAgain
 the kingdom of heaven is like a trader who was looking for fine pearls. ","He found one that was very valuable. So he went away and sold everything he had. And he bought that pearl.","\u201cAgain
 the kingdom of heaven is like a net. It was let down into the lake. It caught all kinds of fish. ","When it was full
 the fishermen pulled it up on the shore. Then they sat down and gathered the good fish into baskets. But they threw the bad fish away. ","This is how it will be on judgment day. The angels will come. They will separate the people who did what is wrong from those who did what is right.","They will throw the evil people into the blazing furnace. There the evil ones will weep and grind their teeth.","\u201cDo you understand all these things?\u201d Jesus asked. \u201cYes
\u201d they replied.","He said to them
 \u201cEvery teacher of the law who has become a disciple in the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house. He brings new treasures out of his storeroom as well as old ones.\u201d","They were not pleased with him at all. But Jesus said to them
 \u201cA prophet is honored everywhere except in his own town and in his own home.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cThey don\u2019t need to go away. You give them something to eat.\u201d","\u201cBring them here to me

 \u201cBe brave! It is I. Don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d","\u201cCome
\u201d Jesus said. So Peter got out of the boat. He walked on the water toward Jesus. ","Right away Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. \u201cYour faith is so small!\u201d he said. \u201cWhy did you doubt me?\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cAnd why don\u2019t you obey God\u2019s command? You would rather follow your own teachings! ","God said
 \u2018Honor your father and mother.\u2019 (Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16) He also said
 \u2018Anyone who asks for bad things to happen to their father or mother must be put to death.\u2019 (Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9) ","But suppose people have something that might be used to help their parents. You allow them to say it is instead \u2018a gift set apart for God.\u2019","So they do not need to honor their father or mother with their gift. You make the word of God useless in order to follow your own teachings.","You pretenders! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you. He said
","\u201c\u2009\u2018These people honor me by what they say. But their hearts are far away from me.","Their worship doesn\u2019t mean anything to me. They teach nothing but human rules.\u2019\u2009\u201d (Isaiah 29:13)","Jesus called the crowd to him. He said
 \u201cListen and understand. ","What goes into someone\u2019s mouth does not make them \u2018unclean.\u2019 It\u2019s what comes out of their mouth that makes them \u2018unclean.\u2019\u2009\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cThey are plants that my Father in heaven has not planted. They will be pulled up by the roots. ","Leave the Pharisees. They are blind guides. If one blind person leads another blind person
 both of them will fall into a pit.\u201d","\u201cDon\u2019t you understand yet?\u201d Jesus asked them.","\u201cDon\u2019t you see? Everything that enters the mouth goes into the stomach.

 \u201cI was sent only to the people of Israel. They are like lost sheep.\u201d","He replied
 \u201cIt is not right to take the children\u2019s bread and throw it to the dogs.\u201d","Then Jesus said to her
 \u201cWoman

 all things are possible.\u201d","\u201cWhat I\u2019m about to tell you is true

 children or fields because of me. Anyone who has done that will receive 100 times as much. They will also receive eternal life. ","But many who are first will be last.

He went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.","He agreed to give them the usual pay for a day\u2019s work. Then he sent them into his vineyard.","\u201cAbout nine o\u2019clock in the morning he went out again. He saw others standing in the market doing nothing.","He told them
 \u2018You also go and work in my vineyard. I\u2019ll pay you what is right.\u2019 ","So they went. \u201cHe went out again about noon and at three o\u2019clock and did the same thing.","About five o\u2019clock he went out and found still others standing around. He asked them
 \u2018Why have you been standing here all day long doing nothing?\u2019","\u201c\u2009\u2018Because no one has hired us
\u2019 they answered. \u201cHe said to them
 \u2018You also go and work in my vineyard.\u2019","\u201cWhen evening came
 the owner of the vineyard spoke to the person who was in charge of the workers. He said
 \u2018Call the workers and give them their pay. Begin with the last ones I hired. Then go on to the first ones.\u2019","\u201cThe workers who were hired about five o\u2019clock came. Each received the usual day\u2019s pay.","So when those who were hired first came
 they expected to receive more. But each of them also received the usual day\u2019s pay. ","When they received it
 they began to complain about the owner. ","\u2018These people who were hired last worked only one hour

I want to give the one I hired last the same pay I gave you.","Don\u2019t I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Do you feel cheated because I gave so freely to the others?\u2019","\u201cSo those who are last will be first. And those who are first will be last.\u201d","\u201cWe are going up to Jerusalem

 \u201cSurely you don\u2019t mean me

 \u201cYou have said so.\u201d","While they were eating
 Jesus took bread. He gave thanks and broke it. He handed it to his disciples and said
 \u201cTake this and eat it. This is my body.\u201d","Then he took a cup. He gave thanks and handed it to them. He said
 \u201cAll of you drink from it. ","This is my blood of the covenant. It is poured out to forgive the sins of many people.","Here is what I tell you. From now on
 I won\u2019t drink wine with you again until the day I drink it with you in my Father\u2019s kingdom.\u201d","Jesus told them

 how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything
 except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.","\u2018You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden.","Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand
 and it gives light to everyone in the house. ","In the same way
 let your light shine before others

 until heaven and earth disappear
 not the smallest letter
 not the least stroke of a pen
 will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. ","Therefore anyone who sets aside one of the least of these commands and teaches others accordingly will be called least in the kingdom of heaven

 you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven.","\u2018You have heard that it was said to the people long ago
 \u201cYou shall not murder

 you will not get out until you have paid the last penny.","\u2018You have heard that it was said
 \u201cYou shall not commit adultery.\u201d ","But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.","If your right eye causes you to stumble
 gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. ","And if your right hand causes you to stumble

 \u201cAnyone who divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce.\u201d ","But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife

 do not swear an oath at all: either by heaven

 for you cannot make even one hair white or black. ","All you need to say is simply \u201cYes
\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d; anything beyond this comes from the evil one.","\u2018You have heard that it was said
 \u201cEye for eye
 and tooth for tooth.\u201d ","But I tell you
 do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek
 turn to them the other cheek also. ","And if anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt
 hand over your coat as well. ","If anyone forces you to go one mile
 go with them two miles. ","Give to the one who asks you

 \u201cLove your neighbour and hate your enemy.\u201d ","But I tell you
 love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you

 what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that? ","And if you greet only your own people
 what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that? ","Be perfect
 therefore
 as your heavenly Father is perfect.","\u2018Be careful not to practise your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them. If you do
 you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.","\u2018So when you give to the needy
 do not announce it with trumpets
 as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets
 to be honoured by others. Truly I tell you
 they have received their reward in full. ","But when you give to the needy
 do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing
 ","so that your giving may be in secret. Then your Father
 who sees what is done in secret
 will reward you.","\u2018And when you pray
 do not be like the hypocrites
 for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you
 they have received their reward in full. ","But when you pray
 go into your room
 close the door and pray to your Father
 who is unseen. Then your Father
 who sees what is done in secret
 will reward you. ","And when you pray
 do not keep on babbling like pagans
 for they think they will be heard because of their many words. ","Do not be like them
 for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.","\u2018This
 then
 is how you should pray: \u2018\u201cOur Father in heaven

 on earth as it is in heaven.","Give us today our daily bread.","And forgive us our debts
 as we also have forgiven our debtors.","And lead us not into temptation
 but deliver us from the evil one.\u201d","For if you forgive other people when they sin against you
 your heavenly Father will also forgive you. ","But if you do not forgive others their sins
 your Father will not forgive your sins.","\u2018When you fast
 do not look sombre as the hypocrites do
 for they disfigure their faces to show others they are fasting. Truly I tell you
 they have received their reward in full. ","But when you fast
 put oil on your head and wash your face
 ","so that it will not be obvious to others that you are fasting
 but only to your Father
 who is unseen; and your Father
 who sees what is done in secret
 will reward you.","\u2018Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth
 where moths and vermin destroy
 and where thieves break in and steal. ","But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven
 where moths and vermin do not destroy
 and where thieves do not break in and steal. ","For where your treasure is
 there your heart will be also.","\u2018The eye is the lamp of the body. If your eyes are healthy
 your whole body will be full of light. ","But if your eyes are unhealthy
 your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light within you is darkness
 how great is that darkness!","\u2018No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other
 or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and Money.","\u2018Therefore I tell you
 do not worry about your life
 what you will eat or drink; or about your body
 what you will wear. Is not life more than food
 and the body more than clothes? ","Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns
 and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? ","Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life?","\u2018And why do you worry about clothes? See how the flowers of the field grow. They do not labour or spin.","Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendour was dressed like one of these.","If that is how God clothes the grass of the field
 which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire

 saying
 \u201cWhat shall we eat?\u201d or \u201cWhat shall we drink?\u201d or \u201cWhat shall we wear?\u201d ","For the pagans run after all these things
 and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. ","But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness
 and all these things will be given to you as well. ","Therefore do not worry about tomorrow
 for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.","\u2018Do not judge
 or you too will be judged. ","For in the same way as you judge others
 you will be judged
 and with the measure you use
 it will be measured to you.","\u2018Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother\u2019s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?","How can you say to your brother
 \u201cLet me take the speck out of your eye
\u201d when all the time there is a plank in your own eye? ","You hypocrite
 first take the plank out of your own eye
 and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother\u2019s eye.","\u2018Do not give dogs what is sacred; do not throw your pearls to pigs. If you do
 they may trample them under their feet
 and turn and tear you to pieces.","\u2018Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.","For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks
 the door will be opened.","\u2018Which of you
 if your son asks for bread
 will give him a stone? ","Or if he asks for a fish
 will give him a snake? ","If you
 then
 though you are evil
 know how to give good gifts to your children
 how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him! ","So in everything
 do to others what you would have them do to you
 for this sums up the Law and the Prophets.","\u2018Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction
 and many enter through it. ","But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life
 and only a few find it.","\u2018Watch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep\u2019s clothing
 but inwardly they are ferocious wolves. ","By their fruit you will recognise them. Do people pick grapes from thorn-bushes
 or figs from thistles? ","Likewise
 every good tree bears good fruit
 but a bad tree bears bad fruit. ","A good tree cannot bear bad fruit
 and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit. ","Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.","Thus
 by their fruit you will recognise them.","\u2018Not everyone who says to me
 \u201cLord
 Lord

 \u201cLord

 the streams rose
 and the winds blew and beat against that house
 and it fell with a great crash.\u2019","Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. \u2018I am willing

 \u2018Go! Let it be done just as you believed it would.\u2019 And his servant was healed at that moment.","Jesus replied
 \u2018Foxes have dens and birds have nests

 \u2018Follow me

 \u2018You of little faith

 and it was completely calm.","He said to them
 \u2018Go!\u2019 So they came out and went into the pigs

 \u2018It is not the healthy who need a doctor

 give it your greeting. ","If the home is deserving
 let your peace rest on it; if it is not
 let your peace return to you. ","If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words

 I will also acknowledge before my Father in heaven. ","But whoever disowns me before others
 I will disown before my Father in heaven.","\u2018Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace
 but a sword. ","For I have come to turn \u2018\u201ca man against his father
 a daughter against her mother
 a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law \u2013 ","a man\u2019s enemies will be the members of his own household.\u201d","\u2018Anyone who loves their father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.","Whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me.","Whoever finds their life will lose it
 and whoever loses their life for my sake will find it.","\u2018Anyone who welcomes you welcomes me
 and anyone who welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me. ","Whoever welcomes a prophet as a prophet will receive a prophet\u2019s reward
 and whoever welcomes a righteous person as a righteous person will receive a righteous person\u2019s reward. ","And if anyone gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones who is my disciple
 truly I tell you
 that person will certainly not lose their reward.\u2019","Jesus replied
 \u2018Go back and report to John what you hear and see: ","the blind receive sight
 the lame walk
 those who have leprosy are cleansed
 the deaf hear
 the dead are raised
 and the good news is proclaimed to the poor. ","Blessed is anyone who does not stumble on account of me.\u2019","As John\u2019s disciples were leaving
 Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: \u2018What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind? ","If not
 what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No
 those who wear fine clothes are in kings\u2019 palaces. ","Then what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes
 I tell you
 and more than a prophet. ","This is the one about whom it is written: \u2018\u201cI will send my messenger ahead of you
 who will prepare your way before you.\u201d","Truly I tell you
 among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet whoever is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. ","From the days of John the Baptist until now
 the kingdom of heaven has been subjected to violence
 and violent people have been raiding it. ","For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John.","And if you are willing to accept it
 he is the Elijah who was to come. ","Whoever has ears
 let them hear.","\u2018To what can I compare this generation? They are like children sitting in the market-places and calling out to others:","\u2018\u201cWe played the pipe for you
 and you did not dance; we sang a dirge
 and you did not mourn.\u201d","For John came neither eating nor drinking
 and they say
 \u201cHe has a demon.\u201d ","The Son of Man came eating and drinking
 and they say
 \u201cHere is a glutton and a drunkard
 a friend of tax collectors and sinners.\u201d But wisdom is proved right by her deeds.\u2019","Then Jesus began to denounce the towns in which most of his miracles had been performed
 because they did not repent. ","\u2018Woe to you
 Chorazin! Woe to you
 Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon
 they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. ","But I tell you
 it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you. ","And you
 Capernaum
 will you be lifted to the heavens? No
 you will go down to Hades. For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom
 it would have remained to this day. ","But I tell you that it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you.\u2019","At that time Jesus said
 \u2018I praise you
 Father
 Lord of heaven and earth
 because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned
 and revealed them to little children. ","Yes
 Father
 for this is what you were pleased to do.","\u2018All things have been committed to me by my Father. No one knows the Son except the Father
 and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.","\u2018Come to me
 all you who are weary and burdened
 and I will give you rest. ","Take my yoke upon you and learn from me
 for I am gentle and humble in heart
 and you will find rest for your souls. ","For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.\u2019","He answered
 \u2018Haven\u2019t you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry? ","He entered the house of God
 and he and his companions ate the consecrated bread \u2013 which was not lawful for them to do
 but only for the priests. ","Or haven\u2019t you read in the Law that the priests on Sabbath duty in the temple desecrate the Sabbath and yet are innocent?","I tell you that something greater than the temple is here.","If you had known what these words mean
 \u201cI desire mercy
 not sacrifice
\u201d you would not have condemned the innocent. ","For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.\u2019","He said to them
 \u2018If any of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath
 will you not take hold of it and lift it out? ","How much more valuable is a person than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.\u2019","Then he said to the man
 \u2018Stretch out your hand.\u2019 So he stretched it out and it was completely restored
 just as sound as the other. ","Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them
 \u2018Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined
 and every city or household divided against itself will not stand. ","If Satan drives out Satan
 he is divided against himself. How then can his kingdom stand? ","And if I drive out demons by Beelzebul
 by whom do your people drive them out? So then
 they will be your judges. ","But if it is by the Spirit of God that I drive out demons
 then the kingdom of God has come upon you.","\u2018Or again
 how can anyone enter a strong man\u2019s house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man? Then he can plunder his house.","\u2018Whoever is not with me is against me
 and whoever does not gather with me scatters. ","And so I tell you
 every kind of sin and slander can be forgiven
 but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. ","Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven
 but anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven
 either in this age or in the age to come.","\u2018Make a tree good and its fruit will be good
 or make a tree bad and its fruit will be bad
 for a tree is recognised by its fruit. ","You brood of vipers
 how can you who are evil say anything good? For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of. ","A good man brings good things out of the good stored up in him
 and an evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in him. ","But I tell you that everyone will have to give account on the day of judgment for every empty word they have spoken.","For by your words you will be acquitted
 and by your words you will be condemned.\u2019","He answered
 \u2018A wicked and adulterous generation asks for a sign! But none will be given it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. ","For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish
 so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. ","The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah
 and now something greater than Jonah is here. ","The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomon\u2019s wisdom
 and now something greater than Solomon is here.","\u2018When an impure spirit comes out of a person
 it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it. ","Then it says
 \u201cI will return to the house I left.\u201d When it arrives
 it finds the house unoccupied
 swept clean and put in order. ","Then it goes and takes with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself
 and they go in and live there. And the final condition of that person is worse than the first. That is how it will be with this wicked generation.\u2019","While Jesus was still talking to the crowd
 his mother and brothers stood outside
 wanting to speak to him. ","He replied to him
 \u2018Who is my mother
 and who are my brothers?\u2019 ","Pointing to his disciples
 he said
 \u2018Here are my mother and my brothers. ","For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.\u2019","Then he told them many things in parables
 saying: \u2018A farmer went out to sow his seed. ","As he was scattering the seed
 some fell along the path
 and the birds came and ate it up. ","Some fell on rocky places
 where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly
 because the soil was shallow. ","But when the sun came up
 the plants were scorched
 and they withered because they had no root. ","Other seed fell among thorns
 which grew up and choked the plants. ","Still other seed fell on good soil
 where it produced a crop \u2013 a hundred
 sixty or thirty times what was sown. ","Whoever has ears
 let them hear.\u2019","He replied
 \u2018Because the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you
 but not to them. ","Whoever has will be given more
 and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have
 even what they have will be taken from them. ","This is why I speak to them in parables: \u2018Though seeing
 they do not see; though hearing
 they do not hear or understand.","In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah: \u2018\u201cYou will be ever hearing but never understanding; you will be ever seeing but never perceiving.","For this people\u2019s heart has become calloused; they hardly hear with their ears
 and they have closed their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes
 hear with their ears
 understand with their hearts and turn
 and I would heal them.\u201d","But blessed are your eyes because they see
 and your ears because they hear. ","For truly I tell you
 many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see but did not see it
 and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.","\u2018Listen then to what the parable of the sower means:","when anyone hears the message about the kingdom and does not understand it
 the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in their heart. This is the seed sown along the path. ","The seed falling on rocky ground refers to someone who hears the word and at once receives it with joy.","But since they have no root
 they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word
 they quickly fall away. ","The seed falling among the thorns refers to someone who hears the word
 but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word
 making it unfruitful. ","But the seed falling on good soil refers to someone who hears the word and understands it. This is the one who produces a crop
 yielding a hundred
 sixty or thirty times what was sown.\u2019","Jesus told them another parable: \u2018The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.","But while everyone was sleeping
 his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat
 and went away. ","When the wheat sprouted and formed ears
 then the weeds also appeared.","\u2018The owner\u2019s servants came to him and said
 \u201cSir
 didn\u2019t you sow good seed in your field? Where then did the weeds come from?\u201d","\u2018\u201cAn enemy did this
\u201d he replied. \u2018The servants asked him
 \u201cDo you want us to go and pull them up?\u201d","\u2018\u201cNo
\u201d he answered
 \u201cbecause while you are pulling up the weeds
 you may uproot the wheat with them. ","Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the harvesters: first collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn.\u201d\u2019","He told them another parable: \u2018The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed
 which a man took and planted in his field. ","Though it is the smallest of all seeds
 yet when it grows
 it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree
 so that the birds come and perch in its branches.\u2019","He told them still another parable: \u2018The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into about thirty kilograms of flour until it worked all through the dough.\u2019","He answered
 \u2018The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man. ","The field is the world
 and the good seed stands for the people of the kingdom. The weeds are the people of the evil one
 ","and the enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age
 and the harvesters are angels.","\u2018As the weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire
 so it will be at the end of the age. ","The Son of Man will send out his angels
 and they will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil. ","They will throw them into the blazing furnace
 where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. ","Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Whoever has ears
 let them hear.","\u2018The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it
 he hid it again
 and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field.","\u2018Again
 the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls. ","When he found one of great value
 he went away and sold everything he had and bought it.","\u2018Once again
 the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was let down into the lake and caught all kinds of fish. ","When it was full
 the fishermen pulled it up on the shore. Then they sat down and collected the good fish in baskets
 but threw the bad away. ","This is how it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous","and throw them into the blazing furnace
 where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.","\u2018Have you understood all these things?\u2019 Jesus asked. \u2018Yes
\u2019 they replied.","He said to them
 \u2018Therefore every teacher of the law who has become a disciple in the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old.\u2019","And they took offence at him. But Jesus said to them
 \u2018A prophet is not without honour except in his own town and in his own home.\u2019","Jesus replied
 \u2018They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat.\u2019","\u2018Bring them here to me
\u2019 he said. ","But Jesus immediately said to them: \u2018Take courage! It is I. Don\u2019t be afraid.\u2019","\u2018Come
\u2019 he said. Then Peter got down out of the boat
 walked on the water and came towards Jesus. ","Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. \u2018You of little faith
\u2019 he said
 \u2018why did you doubt?\u2019","Jesus replied
 \u2018And why do you break the command of God for the sake of your tradition? ","For God said
 \u201cHonour your father and mother\u201d and \u201cAnyone who curses their father or mother is to be put to death.\u201d ","But you say that if anyone declares that what might have been used to help their father or mother is \u201cdevoted to God
\u201d ","they are not to \u201chonour their father or mother\u201d with it. Thus you nullify the word of God for the sake of your tradition.","You hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you:","\u2018\u201cThese people honour me with their lips
 but their hearts are far from me.","They worship me in vain; their teachings are merely human rules.\u201d\u2019","Jesus called the crowd to him and said
 \u2018Listen and understand. ","What goes into someone\u2019s mouth does not defile them
 but what comes out of their mouth
 that is what defiles them.\u2019","He replied
 \u2018Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be pulled up by the roots. ","Leave them; they are blind guides. If the blind lead the blind
 both will fall into a pit.\u2019","\u2018Are you still so dull?\u2019 Jesus asked them.","\u2018Don\u2019t you see that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and then out of the body?","But the things that come out of a person\u2019s mouth come from the heart
 and these defile them. ","For out of the heart come evil thoughts \u2013 murder
 adultery
 sexual immorality
 theft
 false testimony
 slander. ","These are what defile a person; but eating with unwashed hands does not defile them.\u2019","He answered
 \u2018I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel.\u2019","He replied
 \u2018It is not right to take the children\u2019s bread and toss it to the dogs.\u2019","Then Jesus said to her
 \u2018Woman
 you have great faith! Your request is granted.\u2019 And her daughter was healed at that moment.","Jesus called his disciples to him and said
 \u2018I have compassion for these people; they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry
 or they may collapse on the way.\u2019","\u2018How many loaves do you have?\u2019 Jesus asked. \u2018Seven
\u2019 they replied
 \u2018and a few small fish.\u2019","He replied
 \u2018When evening comes
 you say
 \u201cIt will be fair weather
 for the sky is red
\u201d ","and in the morning
 \u201cToday it will be stormy
 for the sky is red and overcast.\u201d You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky
 but you cannot interpret the signs of the times. ","A wicked and adulterous generation looks for a sign
 but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah.\u2019 Jesus then left them and went away.","\u2018Be careful
\u2019 Jesus said to them. \u2018Be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\u2019","Aware of their discussion
 Jesus asked
 \u2018You of little faith
 why are you talking among yourselves about having no bread? ","Do you still not understand? Don\u2019t you remember the five loaves for the five thousand
 and how many basketfuls you gathered? ","Or the seven loaves for the four thousand
 and how many basketfuls you gathered? ","How is it you don\u2019t understand that I was not talking to you about bread? But be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\u2019","When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi
 he asked his disciples
 \u2018Who do people say the Son of Man is?\u2019","\u2018But what about you?\u2019 he asked. \u2018Who do you say I am?\u2019","Jesus replied
 \u2018Blessed are you
 Simon son of Jonah
 for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood
 but by my Father in heaven. ","And I tell you that you are Peter
 and on this rock I will build my church
 and the gates of Hades will not overcome it. ","I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven
 and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.\u2019 ","Jesus turned and said to Peter
 \u2018Get behind me
 Satan! You are a stumbling-block to me; you do not have in mind the concerns of God
 but merely human concerns.\u2019","Then Jesus said to his disciples
 \u2018Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me. ","For whoever wants to save their life will lose it
 but whoever loses their life for me will find it. ","What good will it be for someone to gain the whole world
 yet forfeit their soul? Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul? ","For the Son of Man is going to come in his Father\u2019s glory with his angels
 and then he will reward each person according to what they have done.","\u2018Truly I tell you
 some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.\u2019","But Jesus came and touched them. \u2018Get up
\u2019 he said. \u2018Don\u2019t be afraid.\u2019 ","As they were coming down the mountain
 Jesus instructed them
 \u2018Don\u2019t tell anyone what you have seen
 until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead.\u2019","Jesus replied
 \u2018To be sure
 Elijah comes and will restore all things. ","But I tell you
 Elijah has already come
 and they did not recognise him
 but have done to him everything they wished. In the same way the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands.\u2019 ","\u2018You unbelieving and perverse generation
\u2019 Jesus replied
 \u2018how long shall I stay with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring the boy here to me.\u2019 ","He replied
 \u2018Because you have so little faith. Truly I tell you
 if you have faith as small as a mustard seed
 you can say to this mountain
 \u201cMove from here to there
\u201d and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.\u2019  ","When they came together in Galilee
 he said to them
 \u2018The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men. ","They will kill him
 and on the third day he will be raised to life.\u2019 And the disciples were filled with grief.","\u2018Yes
 he does
\u2019 he replied. When Peter came into the house
 Jesus was the first to speak. \u2018What do you think
 Simon?\u2019 he asked. \u2018From whom do the kings of the earth collect duty and taxes \u2013 from their own children or from others?\u2019","\u2018From others
\u2019 Peter answered. \u2018Then the children are exempt
\u2019 Jesus said to him. ","\u2018But so that we may not cause offence
 go to the lake and throw out your line. Take the first fish you catch; open its mouth and you will find a four-drachma coin. Take it and give it to them for my tax and yours.\u2019","And he said: \u2018Truly I tell you
 unless you change and become like little children
 you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. ","Therefore
 whoever takes the lowly position of this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. ","And whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me.","\u2018If anyone causes one of these little ones \u2013 those who believe in me \u2013 to stumble
 it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung round their neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea. ","Woe to the world because of the things that cause people to stumble! Such things must come
 but woe to the person through whom they come! ","If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble
 cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life maimed or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire. ","And if your eye causes you to stumble
 gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell.","\u2018See that you do not despise one of these little ones. For I tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven.","\u2018What do you think? If a man owns a hundred sheep
 and one of them wanders away
 will he not leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go to look for the one that wandered off? ","And if he finds it
 truly I tell you
 he is happier about that one sheep than about the ninety-nine that did not wander off. ","In the same way your Father in heaven is not willing that any of these little ones should perish.","\u2018If your brother or sister sins
 go and point out their fault
 just between the two of you. If they listen to you
 you have won them over. ","But if they will not listen
 take one or two others along
 so that \u201cevery matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.\u201d ","If they still refuse to listen
 tell it to the church; and if they refuse to listen even to the church
 treat them as you would a pagan or a tax collector.","\u2018Truly I tell you
 whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven
 and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.","\u2018Again
 truly I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything they ask for
 it will be done for them by my Father in heaven. ","For where two or three gather in my name
 there am I with them.\u2019","Jesus answered
 \u2018I tell you
 not seven times
 but seventy-seven times.","\u2018Therefore
 the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants. ","As he began the settlement
 a man who owed him ten thousand bags of gold was brought to him. ","Since he was not able to pay
 the master ordered that he and his wife and his children and all that he had be sold to repay the debt.","\u2018At this the servant fell on his knees before him. \u201cBe patient with me
\u201d he begged
 \u201cand I will pay back everything.\u201d ","The servant\u2019s master took pity on him
 cancelled the debt and let him go.","\u2018But when that servant went out
 he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred silver coins. He grabbed him and began to choke him. \u201cPay back what you owe me!\u201d he demanded.","\u2018His fellow servant fell to his knees and begged him
 \u201cBe patient with me
 and I will pay it back.\u201d","\u2018But he refused. Instead
 he went off and had the man thrown into prison until he could pay the debt. ","When the other servants saw what had happened
 they were outraged and went and told their master everything that had happened.","\u2018Then the master called the servant in. \u201cYou wicked servant
\u201d he said
 \u201cI cancelled all that debt of yours because you begged me to. ","Shouldn\u2019t you have had mercy on your fellow servant just as I had on you?\u201d","In anger his master handed him over to the jailers to be tortured
 until he should pay back all he owed.","\u2018This is how my heavenly Father will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart.\u2019","\u2018Haven\u2019t you read
\u2019 he replied
 \u2018that at the beginning the Creator \u201cmade them male and female
\u201d ","and said
 \u201cFor this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife
 and the two will become one flesh\u201d? ","So they are no longer two
 but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together
 let no one separate.\u2019","Jesus replied
 \u2018Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But it was not this way from the beginning. ","I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife
 except for sexual immorality
 and marries another woman commits adultery.\u2019","Jesus replied
 \u2018Not everyone can accept this word
 but only those to whom it has been given. ","For there are eunuchs who were born that way
 and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others \u2013 and there are those who choose to live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. The one who can accept this should accept it.\u2019","Jesus said
 \u2018Let the little children come to me
 and do not hinder them
 for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.\u2019 ","\u2018Why do you ask me about what is good?\u2019 Jesus replied. \u2018There is only One who is good. If you want to enter life
 keep the commandments.\u2019","\u2018Which ones?\u2019 he enquired. Jesus replied
 \u2018\u201cYou shall not murder
 you shall not commit adultery
 you shall not steal
 you shall not give false testimony
 ","honour your father and mother
\u201d and \u201clove your neighbour as yourself.\u201d\u2019","Jesus answered
 \u2018If you want to be perfect
 go
 sell your possessions and give to the poor
 and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come
 follow me.\u2019","Then Jesus said to his disciples
 \u2018Truly I tell you
 it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven. ","Again I tell you
 it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.\u2019","Jesus looked at them and said
 \u2018With man this is impossible

 \u2018Truly I tell you
 at the renewal of all things

 you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones
 judging the twelve tribes of Israel. ","And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life.","But many who are first will be last
 and many who are last will be first.","\u2018For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.","He agreed to pay them a denarius for the day and sent them into his vineyard.","\u2018About nine in the morning he went out and saw others standing in the market-place doing nothing.","He told them
 \u201cYou also go and work in my vineyard
 and I will pay you whatever is right.\u201d ","So they went. \u2018He went out again about noon and about three in the afternoon and did the same thing.","About five in the afternoon he went out and found still others standing around. He asked them
 \u201cWhy have you been standing here all day long doing nothing?\u201d","\u2018\u201cBecause no one has hired us
\u201d they answered. \u2018He said to them
 \u201cYou also go and work in my vineyard.\u201d","\u2018When evening came
 the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman
 \u201cCall the workers and pay them their wages
 beginning with the last ones hired and going on to the first.\u201d","\u2018The workers who were hired about five in the afternoon came and each received a denarius.","So when those came who were hired first
 they expected to receive more. But each one of them also received a denarius. ","When they received it
 they began to grumble against the landowner. ","\u201cThese who were hired last worked only one hour
\u201d they said
 \u201cand you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the work and the heat of the day.\u201d","\u2018But he answered one of them
 \u201cI am not being unfair to you
 friend. Didn\u2019t you agree to work for a denarius? ","Take your pay and go. I want to give the one who was hired last the same as I gave you.","Don\u2019t I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Or are you envious because I am generous?\u201d","\u2018So the last will be first
 and the first will be last.\u2019","\u2018We are going up to Jerusalem
 and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law.

 \u2018You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them
 and their high officials exercise authority over them. ","Not so with you. Instead
 whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant
 ","and whoever wants to be first must be your slave \u2013","just as the Son of Man did not come to be served
 but to serve

 he will ask
 \u201cThen why didn\u2019t you believe him?\u201d ","So they answered Jesus
 \u2018We don\u2019t know.\u2019 Then he said
 \u2018Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.","\u2018What do you think? There was a man who had two sons. He went to the first and said
 \u201cSon

\u201d he answered
 but later he changed his mind and went.","\u2018Then the father went to the other son and said the same thing. He answered
 \u201cI will

\u2019 they answered. Jesus said to them
 \u2018Truly I tell you
 the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you. ","For John came to you to show you the way of righteousness
 and you did not believe him
 but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did. And even after you saw this
 you did not repent and believe him.","\u2018Listen to another parable: there was a landowner who planted a vineyard. He put a wall round it
 dug a winepress in it and built a watchtower. Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and moved to another place. ","When the harvest time approached
 he sent his servants to the tenants to collect his fruit.","\u2018The tenants seized his servants; they beat one
 killed another
 and stoned a third. ","Then he sent other servants to them
 more than the first time

 they said to each other
 \u201cThis is the heir. Come
 let\u2019s kill him and take his inheritance.\u201d ","So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.","\u2018Therefore
 when the owner of the vineyard comes
 what will he do to those tenants?\u2019","\u2018He will bring those wretches to a wretched end

 \u2018and he will rent the vineyard to other tenants

 \u2018Have you never read in the Scriptures: \u2018\u201cThe stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; the Lord has done this
 and it is marvellous in our eyes\u201d?","\u2018Therefore I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit.","Anyone who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; anyone on whom it falls will be crushed.\u2019","\u2018The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son.","He sent his servants to those who had been invited to the banquet to tell them to come
 but they refused to come.","\u2018Then he sent some more servants and said
 \u201cTell those who have been invited that I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and fattened cattle have been slaughtered

 \u201cThe wedding banquet is ready

 he noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes. ","He asked
 \u201cHow did you get in here without wedding clothes

 there the vultures will gather.","\u2018Immediately after the distress of those days \u2018\u201cthe sun will be darkened

 people were eating and drinking
 marrying and giving in marriage

 however
 took oil in jars along with their lamps. ","The bridegroom was a long time in coming

 you should have put my money on deposit with the bankers

 for it is written: \u2018\u201cI will strike the shepherd
 and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.\u201d","But after I have risen
 I will go ahead of you into Galilee.\u2019","\u2018Truly I tell you
\u2019 Jesus answered
 \u2018this very night
 before the cock crows
 you will disown me three times.\u2019","Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane
 and he said to them
 \u2018Sit here while I go over there and pray.\u2019 ","Then he said to them
 \u2018My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me.\u2019","Going a little farther
 he fell with his face to the ground and prayed
 \u2018My Father
 if it is possible
 may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will
 but as you will.\u2019","Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. \u2018Couldn\u2019t you men keep watch with me for one hour?\u2019 he asked Peter.","\u2018Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing
 but the flesh is weak.\u2019","He went away a second time and prayed
 \u2018My Father
 if it is not possible for this cup to be taken away unless I drink it
 may your will be done.\u2019","Then he returned to the disciples and said to them
 \u2018Are you still sleeping and resting? Look
 the hour has come
 and the Son of Man is delivered into the hands of sinners. ","Rise! Let us go! Here comes my betrayer!\u2019","Jesus replied
 \u2018Do what you came for
 friend.\u2019 Then the men stepped forward
 seized Jesus and arrested him. ","\u2018Put your sword back in its place
\u2019 Jesus said to him
 \u2018for all who draw the sword will die by the sword. ","Do you think I cannot call on my Father
 and he will at once put at my disposal more than twelve legions of angels? ","But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen in this way?\u2019","In that hour Jesus said to the crowd
 \u2018Am I leading a rebellion
 that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me? Every day I sat in the temple courts teaching
 and you did not arrest me. ","But this has all taken place that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled.\u2019 Then all the disciples deserted him and fled.","\u2018You have said so
\u2019 Jesus replied. \u2018But I say to all of you: from now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.\u2019","Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken: \u2018Before the cock crows
 you will disown me three times.\u2019 And he went outside and wept bitterly.","Meanwhile Jesus stood before the governor
 and the governor asked him
 \u2018Are you the king of the Jews?\u2019 \u2018You have said so
\u2019 Jesus replied.","About three in the afternoon Jesus cried out in a loud voice
 \u2018Eli
 Eli
 lema sabachthani?\u2019 (which means \u2018My God
 my God
 why have you forsaken me?\u2019).","Suddenly Jesus met them. \u2018Greetings
\u2019 he said. They came to him
 clasped his feet and worshipped him. ","Then Jesus said to them
 \u2018Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me.\u2019","Then Jesus came to them and said
 \u2018All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. ","Therefore go and make disciples of all nations
 baptising them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit
 ","and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always
 to the very end of the age.\u2019","But Jesus answered and said to him
 \u201cPermit it to be so now
 for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.\u201d Then he allowed Him.","But He answered and said
 \u201cIt is written
 \u2018Man shall not live by bread alone
 but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.\u2019 \u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cIt is written again
 \u2018You shall not tempt the Lord your God.\u2019 \u201d","Then Jesus said to him
 \u201cAway with you
 Satan! For it is written
 \u2018You shall worship the Lord your God
 and Him only you shall serve.\u2019 \u201d","From that time Jesus began to preach and to say
 \u201cRepent

 \u201cFollow Me

 For they shall obtain mercy.","Blessed are the pure in heart
 For they shall see God.","Blessed are the peacemakers
 For they shall be called sons of God.","Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness\u2019 sake
 For theirs is the kingdom of heaven.","Blessed are you when they revile and persecute you
 and say all kinds of evil against you falsely for My sake. ","Rejoice and be exceedingly glad
 for great is your reward in heaven
 for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.","\u201cYou are the salt of the earth; but if the salt loses its flavor
 how shall it be seasoned? It is then good for nothing but to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by men.","\u201cYou are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden.","Nor do they light a lamp and put it under a basket
 but on a lampstand
 and it gives light to all who are in the house. ","Let your light so shine before men
 that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven.","\u201cDo not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to destroy but to fulfill.","For assuredly
 I say to you
 till heaven and earth pass away
 one jot or one tittle will by no means pass from the law till all is fulfilled. ","Whoever therefore breaks one of the least of these commandments
 and teaches men so
 shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does and teaches them
 he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. ","For I say to you
 that unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees
 you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven. Murder Begins in the Heart","\u201cYou have heard that it was said to those of old
 \u2018You shall not murder
 and whoever murders will be in danger of the judgment.\u2019 ","But I say to you that whoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment. And whoever says to his brother
 \u2018Raca!\u2019 shall be in danger of the council. But whoever says
 \u2018You fool!\u2019 shall be in danger of hell fire. ","Therefore if you bring your gift to the altar
 and there remember that your brother has something against you
 ","leave your gift there before the altar
 and go your way. First be reconciled to your brother
 and then come and offer your gift. ","Agree with your adversary quickly
 while you are on the way with him
 lest your adversary deliver you to the judge
 the judge hand you over to the officer
 and you be thrown into prison. ","Assuredly
 I say to you
 you will by no means get out of there till you have paid the last penny.","\u201cYou have heard that it was said to those of old
 \u2018You shall not commit adultery.\u2019 ","But I say to you that whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.","If your right eye causes you to sin
 pluck it out and cast it from you; for it is more profitable for you that one of your members perish
 than for your whole body to be cast into hell. ","And if your right hand causes you to sin
 cut it off and cast it from you; for it is more profitable for you that one of your members perish
 than for your whole body to be cast into hell. Marriage Is Sacred and Binding","\u201cFurthermore it has been said
 \u2018Whoever divorces his wife
 let him give her a certificate of divorce.\u2019 ","But I say to you that whoever divorces his wife for any reason except sexual immorality causes her to commit adultery; and whoever marries a woman who is divorced commits adultery.","\u201cAgain you have heard that it was said to those of old
 \u2018You shall not swear falsely
 but shall perform your oaths to the Lord.\u2019 ","But I say to you
 do not swear at all: neither by heaven
 for it is God\u2019s throne; ","nor by the earth
 for it is His footstool; nor by Jerusalem
 for it is the city of the great King. ","Nor shall you swear by your head
 because you cannot make one hair white or black. ","But let your \u2018Yes\u2019 be \u2018Yes
\u2019 and your \u2018No
\u2019 \u2018No.\u2019 For whatever is more than these is from the evil one. Go the Second Mile","\u201cYou have heard that it was said
 \u2018An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.\u2019 ","But I tell you not to resist an evil person. But whoever slaps you on your right cheek
 turn the other to him also. ","If anyone wants to sue you and take away your tunic
 let him have your cloak also. ","And whoever compels you to go one mile
 go with him two. ","Give to him who asks you
 and from him who wants to borrow from you do not turn away. Love Your Enemies","\u201cYou have heard that it was said
 \u2018You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.\u2019 ","But I say to you
 love your enemies
 bless those who curse you
 do good to those who hate you
 and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you
 ","that you may be sons of your Father in heaven; for He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good
 and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. ","For if you love those who love you
 what reward have you? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? ","And if you greet your brethren only
 what do you do more than others? Do not even the tax collectors do so? ","Therefore you shall be perfect
 just as your Father in heaven is perfect.","\u201cTake heed that you do not do your charitable deeds before men
 to be seen by them. Otherwise you have no reward from your Father in heaven. ","Therefore
 when you do a charitable deed
 do not sound a trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets
 that they may have glory from men. Assuredly
 I say to you
 they have their reward. ","But when you do a charitable deed
 do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing
 ","that your charitable deed may be in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will Himself reward you openly.","\u201cAnd when you pray
 you shall not be like the hypocrites. For they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the corners of the streets
 that they may be seen by men. Assuredly
 I say to you
 they have their reward. ","But you
 when you pray
 go into your room
 and when you have shut your door
 pray to your Father who is in the secret place; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly. ","And when you pray
 do not use vain repetitions as the heathen do. For they think that they will be heard for their many words.","\u201cTherefore do not be like them. For your Father knows the things you have need of before you ask Him.","In this manner
 therefore
 pray: Our Father in heaven
 Hallowed be Your name.","Your kingdom come. Your will be done On earth as it is in heaven.","Give us this day our daily bread.","And forgive us our debts
 As we forgive our debtors.","And do not lead us into temptation
 But deliver us from the evil one. For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.","\u201cFor if you forgive men their trespasses
 your heavenly Father will also forgive you. ","But if you do not forgive men their trespasses
 neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.","\u201cMoreover
 when you fast
 do not be like the hypocrites
 with a sad countenance. For they disfigure their faces that they may appear to men to be fasting. Assuredly
 I say to you
 they have their reward. ","But you
 when you fast
 anoint your head and wash your face
 ","so that you do not appear to men to be fasting
 but to your Father who is in the secret place; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly.","\u201cDo not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth
 where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal; ","but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven
 where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. ","For where your treasure is
 there your heart will be also.","\u201cThe lamp of the body is the eye. If therefore your eye is good
 your whole body will be full of light. ","But if your eye is bad
 your whole body will be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in you is darkness
 how great is that darkness!","\u201cNo one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other
 or else he will be loyal to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon. Do Not Worry","\u201cTherefore I say to you
 do not worry about your life
 what you will eat or what you will drink; nor about your body
 what you will put on. Is not life more than food and the body more than clothing? ","Look at the birds of the air
 for they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? ","Which of you by worrying can add one cubit to his stature?","\u201cSo why do you worry about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field
 how they grow: they neither toil nor spin; ","and yet I say to you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.","Now if God so clothes the grass of the field
 which today is
 and tomorrow is thrown into the oven
 will He not much more clothe you
 O you of little faith?","\u201cTherefore do not worry
 saying
 \u2018What shall we eat?\u2019 or \u2018What shall we drink?\u2019 or \u2018What shall we wear?\u2019 ","For after all these things the Gentiles seek. For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.","But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness
 and all these things shall be added to you. ","Therefore do not worry about tomorrow
 for tomorrow will worry about its own things. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.","\u201cJudge not
 that you be not judged. ","For with what judgment you judge
 you will be judged; and with the measure you use
 it will be measured back to you. ","And why do you look at the speck in your brother\u2019s eye
 but do not consider the plank in your own eye? ","Or how can you say to your brother
 \u2018Let me remove the speck from your eye\u2019; and look
 a plank is in your own eye? ","Hypocrite! First remove the plank from your own eye
 and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother\u2019s eye.","\u201cDo not give what is holy to the dogs; nor cast your pearls before swine
 lest they trample them under their feet
 and turn and tear you in pieces.","\u201cAsk
 and it will be given to you; seek
 and you will find; knock
 and it will be opened to you. ","For everyone who asks receives
 and he who seeks finds
 and to him who knocks it will be opened. ","Or what man is there among you who
 if his son asks for bread
 will give him a stone? ","Or if he asks for a fish
 will he give him a serpent? ","If you then
 being evil
 know how to give good gifts to your children
 how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him! ","Therefore
 whatever you want men to do to you
 do also to them
 for this is the Law and the Prophets.","\u201cEnter by the narrow gate; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction
 and there are many who go in by it. ","Because narrow is the gate and difficult is the way which leads to life
 and there are few who find it.","\u201cBeware of false prophets
 who come to you in sheep\u2019s clothing
 but inwardly they are ravenous wolves. ","You will know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes from thornbushes or figs from thistles?","Even so
 every good tree bears good fruit
 but a bad tree bears bad fruit. ","A good tree cannot bear bad fruit
 nor can a bad tree bear good fruit. ","Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.","Therefore by their fruits you will know them.","\u201cNot everyone who says to Me
 \u2018Lord
 Lord
\u2019 shall enter the kingdom of heaven
 but he who does the will of My Father in heaven. ","Many will say to Me in that day
 \u2018Lord
 Lord

 and done many wonders in Your name?\u2019 ","And then I will declare to them
 \u2018I never knew you; depart from Me
 you who practice lawlessness!\u2019 Build on the Rock","\u201cTherefore whoever hears these sayings of Mine
 and does them
 I will liken him to a wise man who built his house on the rock: ","and the rain descended
 the floods came
 and the winds blew and beat on that house; and it did not fall
 for it was founded on the rock.","\u201cBut everyone who hears these sayings of Mine
 and does not do them
 will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand: ","and the rain descended

 saying
 \u201cI am willing; be cleansed.\u201d Immediately his leprosy was cleansed.","And Jesus said to him
 \u201cSee that you tell no one; but go your way

 and sit down with Abraham
 Isaac
 and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. ","But the sons of the kingdom will be cast out into outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\u201d","Then Jesus said to the centurion
 \u201cGo your way; and as you have believed
 so let it be done for you.\u201d And his servant was healed that same hour.","And Jesus said to him
 \u201cFoxes have holes and birds of the air have nests

 \u201cFollow Me
 and let the dead bury their own dead.\u201d","But He said to them
 \u201cWhy are you fearful
 O you of little faith?\u201d Then He arose and rebuked the winds and the sea

 \u201cGo.\u201d So when they had come out
 they went into the herd of swine. And suddenly the whole herd of swine ran violently down the steep place into the sea
 and perished in the water.","Then behold
 they brought to Him a paralytic lying on a bed. When Jesus saw their faith
 He said to the paralytic
 \u201cSon
 be of good cheer; your sins are forgiven you.\u201d","But Jesus
 knowing their thoughts
 said
 \u201cWhy do you think evil in your hearts? ","For which is easier

 \u2018Your sins are forgiven you
\u2019 or to say
 \u2018Arise and walk\u2019? ","But that you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins\u201d\u2014then He said to the paralytic
 \u201cArise
 take up your bed

 He saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax office. And He said to him
 \u201cFollow Me.\u201d So he arose and followed Him.","When Jesus heard that
 He said to them
 \u201cThose who are well have no need of a physician

 to repentance.\u201d","And Jesus said to them
 \u201cCan the friends of the bridegroom mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them

 but only for the priests? ","Or have you not read in the law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath
 and are blameless? ","Yet I say to you that in this place there is One greater than the temple.","But if you had known what this means
 \u2018I desire mercy and not sacrifice
\u2019 you would not have condemned the guiltless. ","For the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.\u201d","Then He said to them
 \u201cWhat man is there among you who has one sheep
 and if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath
 will not lay hold of it and lift it out? ","Of how much more value then is a man than a sheep? Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.\u201d","Then He said to the man
 \u201cStretch out your hand.\u201d And he stretched it out
 and it was restored as whole as the other. ","But Jesus knew their thoughts
 and said to them: \u201cEvery kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation
 and every city or house divided against itself will not stand. ","If Satan casts out Satan
 he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand? ","And if I cast out demons by Beelzebub
 by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges. ","But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God
 surely the kingdom of God has come upon you. ","Or how can one enter a strong man\u2019s house and plunder his goods
 unless he first binds the strong man? And then he will plunder his house. ","He who is not with Me is against Me
 and he who does not gather with Me scatters abroad.","\u201cTherefore I say to you
 every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men
 but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven men. ","Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man
 it will be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit
 it will not be forgiven him
 either in this age or in the age to come. A Tree Known by Its Fruit","\u201cEither make the tree good and its fruit good
 or else make the tree bad and its fruit bad; for a tree is known by its fruit. ","Brood of vipers! How can you
 being evil
 speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. ","A good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth good things
 and an evil man out of the evil treasure brings forth evil things. ","But I say to you that for every idle word men may speak
 they will give account of it in the day of judgment. ","For by your words you will be justified
 and by your words you will be condemned.\u201d The Scribes and Pharisees Ask for a Sign","But He answered and said to them
 \u201cAn evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign
 and no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. ","For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish
 so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. ","The men of Nineveh will rise up in the judgment with this generation and condemn it
 because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and indeed a greater than Jonah is here. ","The queen of the South will rise up in the judgment with this generation and condemn it
 for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and indeed a greater than Solomon is here. An Unclean Spirit Returns","\u201cWhen an unclean spirit goes out of a man
 he goes through dry places
 seeking rest
 and finds none. ","Then he says
 \u2018I will return to my house from which I came.\u2019 And when he comes
 he finds it empty
 swept
 and put in order. ","Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself
 and they enter and dwell there; and the last state of that man is worse than the first. So shall it also be with this wicked generation.\u201d Jesus\u2019 Mother and Brothers Send for Him","While He was still talking to the multitudes
 behold
 His mother and brothers stood outside
 seeking to speak with Him. ","But He answered and said to the one who told Him
 \u201cWho is My mother and who are My brothers?\u201d ","And He stretched out His hand toward His disciples and said
 \u201cHere are My mother and My brothers! ","For whoever does the will of My Father in heaven is My brother and sister and mother.\u201d","Then He spoke many things to them in parables
 saying: \u201cBehold
 a sower went out to sow. ","And as he sowed
 some seed fell by the wayside; and the birds came and devoured them. ","Some fell on stony places
 where they did not have much earth; and they immediately sprang up because they had no depth of earth. ","But when the sun was up they were scorched
 and because they had no root they withered away. ","And some fell among thorns
 and the thorns sprang up and choked them. ","But others fell on good ground and yielded a crop: some a hundredfold
 some sixty
 some thirty. ","He who has ears to hear
 let him hear!\u201d","He answered and said to them
 \u201cBecause it has been given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven
 but to them it has not been given. ","For whoever has
 to him more will be given
 and he will have abundance; but whoever does not have
 even what he has will be taken away from him. ","Therefore I speak to them in parables
 because seeing they do not see
 and hearing they do not hear
 nor do they understand. ","And in them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled
 which says: \u2018Hearing you will hear and shall not understand
 And seeing you will see and not perceive;","For the hearts of this people have grown dull. Their ears are hard of hearing
 And their eyes they have closed
 Lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears
 Lest they should understand with their hearts and turn
 So that I should heal them.\u2019","But blessed are your eyes for they see
 and your ears for they hear; ","for assuredly
 I say to you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see what you see
 and did not see it
 and to hear what you hear
 and did not hear it.","\u201cTherefore hear the parable of the sower:","When anyone hears the word of the kingdom
 and does not understand it
 then the wicked one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is he who received seed by the wayside. ","But he who received the seed on stony places
 this is he who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy; ","yet he has no root in himself
 but endures only for a while. For when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word
 immediately he stumbles. ","Now he who received seed among the thorns is he who hears the word
 and the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word
 and he becomes unfruitful. ","But he who received seed on the good ground is he who hears the word and understands it
 who indeed bears fruit and produces: some a hundredfold
 some sixty
 some thirty.\u201d","Another parable He put forth to them
 saying: \u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field; ","but while men slept
 his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat and went his way. ","But when the grain had sprouted and produced a crop
 then the tares also appeared. ","So the servants of the owner came and said to him
 \u2018Sir
 did you not sow good seed in your field? How then does it have tares?\u2019 ","He said to them
 \u2018An enemy has done this.\u2019 The servants said to him
 \u2018Do you want us then to go and gather them up?\u2019 ","But he said
 \u2018No
 lest while you gather up the tares you also uproot the wheat with them. ","Let both grow together until the harvest
 and at the time of harvest I will say to the reapers
 \u201cFirst gather together the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them
 but gather the wheat into my barn.\u201d \u2019 \u201d The Parable of the Mustard Seed","Another parable He put forth to them
 saying: \u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed
 which a man took and sowed in his field
 ","which indeed is the least of all the seeds; but when it is grown it is greater than the herbs and becomes a tree
 so that the birds of the air come and nest in its branches.\u201d The Parable of the Leaven","Another parable He spoke to them: \u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like leaven
 which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal till it was all leavened.\u201d","He answered and said to them: \u201cHe who sows the good seed is the Son of Man.","The field is the world
 the good seeds are the sons of the kingdom
 but the tares are the sons of the wicked one. ","The enemy who sowed them is the devil
 the harvest is the end of the age
 and the reapers are the angels. ","Therefore as the tares are gathered and burned in the fire
 so it will be at the end of this age. ","The Son of Man will send out His angels
 and they will gather out of His kingdom all things that offend
 and those who practice lawlessness
 ","and will cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.","Then the righteous will shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears to hear
 let him hear!","\u201cAgain
 the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field
 which a man found and hid; and for joy over it he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.","\u201cAgain
 the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking beautiful pearls
 ","who
 when he had found one pearl of great price
 went and sold all that he had and bought it.","\u201cAgain
 the kingdom of heaven is like a dragnet that was cast into the sea and gathered some of every kind
 ","which
 when it was full
 they drew to shore; and they sat down and gathered the good into vessels
 but threw the bad away. ","So it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come forth
 separate the wicked from among the just
 ","and cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cHave you understood all these things?\u201d They said to Him
 \u201cYes
 Lord.\u201d","Then He said to them
 \u201cTherefore every scribe instructed concerning the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings out of his treasure things new and old.\u201d Jesus Rejected at Nazareth","So they were offended at Him. But Jesus said to them
 \u201cA prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own house.\u201d ","But Jesus said to them
 \u201cThey do not need to go away. You give them something to eat.\u201d","He said
 \u201cBring them here to Me.\u201d ","But immediately Jesus spoke to them
 saying
 \u201cBe of good cheer! It is I; do not be afraid.\u201d","So He said
 \u201cCome.\u201d And when Peter had come down out of the boat
 he walked on the water to go to Jesus. ","And immediately Jesus stretched out His hand and caught him
 and said to him
 \u201cO you of little faith
 why did you doubt?\u201d ","He answered and said to them
 \u201cWhy do you also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition? ","For God commanded
 saying
 \u2018Honor your father and your mother\u2019; and
 \u2018He who curses father or mother
 let him be put to death.\u2019 ","But you say
 \u2018Whoever says to his father or mother
 \u201cWhatever profit you might have received from me is a gift to God\u201d\u2014 ","then he need not honor his father or mother.\u2019 Thus you have made the commandment of God of no effect by your tradition.","Hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy about you
 saying:","\u2018These people draw near to Me with their mouth
 And honor Me with their lips
 But their heart is far from Me.","And in vain they worship Me
 Teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.\u2019 \u201d","When He had called the multitude to Himself
 He said to them
 \u201cHear and understand: ","Not what goes into the mouth defiles a man; but what comes out of the mouth
 this defiles a man.\u201d","But He answered and said
 \u201cEvery plant which My heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted. ","Let them alone. They are blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind leads the blind
 both will fall into a ditch.\u201d","So Jesus said
 \u201cAre you also still without understanding? ","Do you not yet understand that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and is eliminated?","But those things which proceed out of the mouth come from the heart
 and they defile a man. ","For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts
 murders
 adulteries
 fornications
 thefts
 false witness
 blasphemies. ","These are the things which defile a man
 but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a man.\u201d","But He answered and said
 \u201cI was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\u201d","But He answered and said
 \u201cIt is not good to take the children\u2019s bread and throw it to the little dogs.\u201d","Then Jesus answered and said to her
 \u201cO woman
 great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire.\u201d And her daughter was healed from that very hour.","Now Jesus called His disciples to Himself and said
 \u201cI have compassion on the multitude
 because they have now continued with Me three days and have nothing to eat. And I do not want to send them away hungry
 lest they faint on the way.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cHow many loaves do you have?\u201d And they said
 \u201cSeven
 and a few little fish.\u201d","He answered and said to them
 \u201cWhen it is evening you say
 \u2018It will be fair weather
 for the sky is red\u2019; ","and in the morning
 \u2018It will be foul weather today
 for the sky is red and threatening.\u2019 Hypocrites! You know how to discern the face of the sky
 but you cannot discern the signs of the times. ","A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign
 and no sign shall be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.\u201d And He left them and departed.","Then Jesus said to them
 \u201cTake heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.\u201d","But Jesus
 being aware of it
 said to them
 \u201cO you of little faith
 why do you reason among yourselves because you have brought no bread? ","Do you not yet understand
 or remember the five loaves of the five thousand and how many baskets you took up? ","Nor the seven loaves of the four thousand and how many large baskets you took up?","How is it you do not understand that I did not speak to you concerning bread?\u2014but to beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\u201d","When Jesus came into the region of Caesarea Philippi
 He asked His disciples
 saying
 \u201cWho do men say that I
 the Son of Man
 am?\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cBut who do you say that I am?\u201d","Jesus answered and said to him
 \u201cBlessed are you
 Simon Bar-Jonah

 and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it. ","And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven
 and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven

 \u201cGet behind Me
 Satan! You are an offense to Me
 for you are not mindful of the things of God
 but the things of men.\u201d","Then Jesus said to His disciples
 \u201cIf anyone desires to come after Me
 let him deny himself
 and take up his cross
 and follow Me. ","For whoever desires to save his life will lose it
 but whoever loses his life for My sake will find it. ","For what profit is it to a man if he gains the whole world
 and loses his own soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul? ","For the Son of Man will come in the glory of His Father with His angels
 and then He will reward each according to his works. ","Assuredly
 I say to you
 there are some standing here who shall not taste death till they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom.\u201d","But Jesus came and touched them and said
 \u201cArise
 and do not be afraid.\u201d ","Now as they came down from the mountain
 Jesus commanded them
 saying
 \u201cTell the vision to no one until the Son of Man is risen from the dead.\u201d","Jesus answered and said to them
 \u201cIndeed
 Elijah is coming first and will restore all things. ","But I say to you that Elijah has come already
 and they did not know him but did to him whatever they wished. Likewise the Son of Man is also about to suffer at their hands.\u201d ","Then Jesus answered and said
 \u201cO faithless and perverse generation
 how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him here to Me.\u201d ","So Jesus said to them
 \u201cBecause of your unbelief; for assuredly
 I say to you

 you will say to this mountain
 \u2018Move from here to there
\u2019 and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you. ","Now while they were staying in Galilee
 Jesus said to them
 \u201cThe Son of Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men
 ","and they will kill Him
 and the third day He will be raised up.\u201d And they were exceedingly sorrowful.","He said
 \u201cYes.\u201d And when he had come into the house

 \u201cWhat do you think
 Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth take customs or taxes
 from their sons or from strangers?\u201d","Peter said to Him
 \u201cFrom strangers.\u201d Jesus said to him

 lest we offend them
 go to the sea
 cast in a hook

 you will find a piece of money; take that and give it to them for Me and you.\u201d","and said
 \u201cAssuredly
 I say to you
 unless you are converted and become as little children

 it would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck
 and he were drowned in the depth of the sea. ","Woe to the world because of offenses! For offenses must come
 but woe to that man by whom the offense comes!","\u201cIf your hand or foot causes you to sin
 cut it off and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life lame or maimed
 rather than having two hands or two feet
 to be cast into the everlasting fire. ","And if your eye causes you to sin
 pluck it out and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life with one eye
 rather than having two eyes
 to be cast into hell fire.","\u201cTake heed that you do not despise one of these little ones
 for I say to you that in heaven their angels always see the face of My Father who is in heaven. ","\u201cWhat do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep
 and one of them goes astray
 does he not leave the ninety-nine and go to the mountains to seek the one that is straying? ","And if he should find it
 assuredly
 I say to you
 he rejoices more over that sheep than over the ninety-nine that did not go astray. ","Even so it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.","\u201cMoreover if your brother sins against you
 go and tell him his fault between you and him alone. If he hears you
 you have gained your brother. ","But if he will not hear
 take with you one or two more
 that \u2018by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.\u2019 ","And if he refuses to hear them
 tell it to the church. But if he refuses even to hear the church
 let him be to you like a heathen and a tax collector.","\u201cAssuredly
 I say to you
 whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven
 and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.","\u201cAgain I say to you that if two of you agree on earth concerning anything that they ask
 it will be done for them by My Father in heaven. ","For where two or three are gathered together in My name
 I am there in the midst of them.\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cI do not say to you
 up to seven times
 but up to seventy times seven. ","Therefore the kingdom of heaven is like a certain king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.","And when he had begun to settle accounts
 one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents. ","But as he was not able to pay
 his master commanded that he be sold
 with his wife and children and all that he had
 and that payment be made. ","The servant therefore fell down before him
 saying
 \u2018Master
 have patience with me
 and I will pay you all.\u2019 ","Then the master of that servant was moved with compassion
 released him
 and forgave him the debt.","\u201cBut that servant went out and found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii; and he laid hands on him and took him by the throat
 saying
 \u2018Pay me what you owe!\u2019 ","So his fellow servant fell down at his feet and begged him
 saying
 \u2018Have patience with me
 and I will pay you all.\u2019 ","And he would not
 but went and threw him into prison till he should pay the debt. ","So when his fellow servants saw what had been done
 they were very grieved
 and came and told their master all that had been done. ","Then his master
 after he had called him
 said to him
 \u2018You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you begged me. ","Should you not also have had compassion on your fellow servant
 just as I had pity on you?\u2019 ","And his master was angry
 and delivered him to the torturers until he should pay all that was due to him.","\u201cSo My heavenly Father also will do to you if each of you
 from his heart
 does not forgive his brother his trespasses.\u201d","And He answered and said to them
 \u201cHave you not read that He who made them at the beginning \u2018made them male and female
\u2019 ","and said
 \u2018For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife
 and the two shall become one flesh\u2019? ","So then
 they are no longer two but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together
 let not man separate.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cMoses
 because of the hardness of your hearts
 permitted you to divorce your wives
 but from the beginning it was not so. ","And I say to you
 whoever divorces his wife
 except for sexual immorality
 and marries another
 commits adultery; and whoever marries her who is divorced commits adultery.\u201d","But He said to them
 \u201cAll cannot accept this saying
 but only those to whom it has been given: ","For there are eunuchs who were born thus from their mother\u2019s womb
 and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men
 and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven\u2019s sake. He who is able to accept it
 let him accept it.\u201d","But Jesus said
 \u201cLet the little children come to Me
 and do not forbid them; for of such is the kingdom of heaven.\u201d ","So He said to him
 \u201cWhy do you call Me good? No one is good but One
 that is
 God. But if you want to enter into life
 keep the commandments.\u201d","He said to Him
 \u201cWhich ones?\u201d Jesus said
 \u201c\u2018You shall not murder
\u2019 \u2018You shall not commit adultery
\u2019 \u2018You shall not steal
\u2019 \u2018You shall not bear false witness
\u2019 ","\u2018Honor your father and your mother
\u2019 and
 \u2018You shall love your neighbor as yourself.\u2019 \u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cIf you want to be perfect
 go
 sell what you have and give to the poor
 and you will have treasure in heaven; and come
 follow Me.\u201d","Then Jesus said to His disciples
 \u201cAssuredly
 I say to you that it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. ","And again I say to you
 it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.\u201d","But Jesus looked at them and said to them
 \u201cWith men this is impossible

 when the Son of Man sits on the throne of His glory
 you who have followed Me will also sit on twelve thrones
 judging the twelve tribes of Israel. ","And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands
 for My name\u2019s sake
 shall receive a hundredfold
 and inherit eternal life. ","But many who are first will be last
 and the last first.","\u201cFor the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.","Now when he had agreed with the laborers for a denarius a day
 he sent them into his vineyard. ","And he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the marketplace
 ","and said to them
 \u2018You also go into the vineyard
 and whatever is right I will give you.\u2019 So they went. ","Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour
 and did likewise. ","And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing idle
 and said to them
 \u2018Why have you been standing here idle all day?\u2019 ","They said to him
 \u2018Because no one hired us.\u2019 He said to them
 \u2018You also go into the vineyard
 and whatever is right you will receive.\u2019","\u201cSo when evening had come
 the owner of the vineyard said to his steward
 \u2018Call the laborers and give them their wages
 beginning with the last to the first.\u2019 ","And when those came who were hired about the eleventh hour
 they each received a denarius. ","But when the first came
 they supposed that they would receive more; and they likewise received each a denarius. ","And when they had received it
 they complained against the landowner
 ","saying
 \u2018These last men have worked only one hour
 and you made them equal to us who have borne the burden and the heat of the day.\u2019 ","But he answered one of them and said
 \u2018Friend
 I am doing you no wrong. Did you not agree with me for a denarius? ","Take what is yours and go your way. I wish to give to this last man the same as to you.","Is it not lawful for me to do what I wish with my own things? Or is your eye evil because I am good?\u2019","So the last will be first
 and the first last. For many are called
 but few chosen.\u201d","\u201cBehold
 we are going up to Jerusalem

 ","and deliver Him to the Gentiles to mock and to scourge and to crucify. And the third day He will rise again.\u201d","And He said to her
 \u201cWhat do you wish?\u201d She said to Him
 \u201cGrant that these two sons of mine may sit
 one on Your right hand and the other on the left
 in Your kingdom.\u201d","But Jesus answered and said
 \u201cYou do not know what you ask. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink
 and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?\u201d They said to Him
 \u201cWe are able.\u201d","But Jesus called them to Himself and said
 \u201cYou know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them

 let him be your servant. ","And whoever desires to be first among you
 let him be your slave\u2014 ","just as the Son of Man did not come to be served
 but to serve
 and to give His life a ransom for many.\u201d Two Blind Men Receive Their Sight","So Jesus stood still and called them
 and said
 \u201cWhat do you want Me to do for you?\u201d","saying to them
 \u201cGo into the village opposite you

 and a colt with her. Loose them and bring them to Me. ","And if anyone says anything to you
 you shall say
 \u2018The Lord has need of them

\u2019 it will be done. ","And whatever things you ask in prayer
 believing
 you will receive.\u201d Jesus\u2019 Authority Questioned","But Jesus answered and said to them
 \u201cI also will ask you one thing
 which if you tell Me
 I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things: ","The baptism of John\u2014where was it from? From heaven or from men?\u201d And they reasoned among themselves
 saying
 \u201cIf we say
 \u2018From heaven
\u2019 He will say to us
 \u2018Why then did you not believe him?\u2019 ","So they answered Jesus and said
 \u201cWe do not know.\u201d And He said to them
 \u201cNeither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.","\u201cBut what do you think? A man had two sons
 and he came to the first and said
 \u2018Son
 go
 work today in my vineyard.\u2019 ","He answered and said
 \u2018I will not
\u2019 but afterward he regretted it and went. ","Then he came to the second and said likewise. And he answered and said
 \u2018I go
 sir
\u2019 but he did not go. ","Which of the two did the will of his father?\u201d They said to Him
 \u201cThe first.\u201d Jesus said to them
 \u201cAssuredly
 I say to you that tax collectors and harlots enter the kingdom of God before you. ","For John came to you in the way of righteousness
 and you did not believe him; but tax collectors and harlots believed him; and when you saw it
 you did not afterward relent and believe him. The Parable of the Wicked Vinedressers","\u201cHear another parable: There was a certain landowner who planted a vineyard and set a hedge around it
 dug a winepress in it and built a tower. And he leased it to vinedressers and went into a far country. ","Now when vintage-time drew near
 he sent his servants to the vinedressers
 that they might receive its fruit. ","And the vinedressers took his servants
 beat one
 killed one
 and stoned another. ","Again he sent other servants
 more than the first
 and they did likewise to them. ","Then last of all he sent his son to them
 saying
 \u2018They will respect my son.\u2019 ","But when the vinedressers saw the son
 they said among themselves
 \u2018This is the heir. Come
 let us kill him and seize his inheritance.\u2019 ","So they took him and cast him out of the vineyard and killed him.","\u201cTherefore
 when the owner of the vineyard comes
 what will he do to those vinedressers?\u201d","They said to Him
 \u201cHe will destroy those wicked men miserably
 and lease his vineyard to other vinedressers who will render to him the fruits in their seasons.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cHave you never read in the Scriptures: \u2018The stone which the builders rejected Has become the chief cornerstone. This was the Lord\u2019s doing
 And it is marvelous in our eyes\u2019?","\u201cTherefore I say to you
 the kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to a nation bearing the fruits of it. ","And whoever falls on this stone will be broken; but on whomever it falls
 it will grind him to powder.\u201d","\u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like a certain king who arranged a marriage for his son
 ","and sent out his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding; and they were not willing to come.","Again
 he sent out other servants

 \u2018Tell those who are invited
 \u201cSee
 I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and fatted cattle are killed
 and all things are ready. Come to the wedding.\u201d \u2019 ","But they made light of it and went their ways
 one to his own farm
 another to his business. ","And the rest seized his servants
 treated them spitefully
 and killed them. ","But when the king heard about it
 he was furious. And he sent out his armies
 destroyed those murderers
 and burned up their city. ","Then he said to his servants
 \u2018The wedding is ready
 but those who were invited were not worthy. ","Therefore go into the highways
 and as many as you find
 invite to the wedding.\u2019 ","So those servants went out into the highways and gathered together all whom they found
 both bad and good. And the wedding hall was filled with guests.","\u201cBut when the king came in to see the guests
 he saw a man there who did not have on a wedding garment. ","So he said to him
 \u2018Friend
 how did you come in here without a wedding garment?\u2019 And he was speechless. ","Then the king said to the servants
 \u2018Bind him hand and foot
 take him away
 and cast him into outer darkness; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\u2019","\u201cFor many are called
 but few are chosen.\u201d","But Jesus perceived their wickedness
 and said
 \u201cWhy do you test Me
 you hypocrites? ","Show Me the tax money.\u201d So they brought Him a denarius.","And He said to them
 \u201cWhose image and inscription is this?\u201d","They said to Him

 \u201cYou are mistaken

 ","\u2018I am the God of Abraham
 the God of Isaac

 the love of many will grow cold. ","But he who endures to the end shall be saved.","And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in all the world as a witness to all the nations

 there you have what is yours.\u2019","\u201cBut his lord answered and said to him
 \u2018You wicked and lazy servant

 and give it to him who has ten talents.","\u2018For to everyone who has
 more will be given

 for they will inherit the whole earth.","God blesses those who hunger and thirst for justice
 for they will be satisfied.","God blesses those who are merciful
 for they will be shown mercy.","God blesses those whose hearts are pure
 for they will see God.","God blesses those who work for peace
 for they will be called the children of God.","God blesses those who are persecuted for doing right
 for the Kingdom of Heaven is theirs.","\u201cGod blesses you when people mock you and persecute you and lie about you and say all sorts of evil things against you because you are my followers.","Be happy about it! Be very glad! For a great reward awaits you in heaven. And remember
 the ancient prophets were persecuted in the same way.","\u201cYou are the salt of the earth. But what good is salt if it has lost its flavor? Can you make it salty again? It will be thrown out and trampled underfoot as worthless.","\u201cYou are the light of the world\u2014like a city on a hilltop that cannot be hidden.","No one lights a lamp and then puts it under a basket. Instead
 a lamp is placed on a stand
 where it gives light to everyone in the house.","In the same way
 let your good deeds shine out for all to see
 so that everyone will praise your heavenly Father.","\u201cDon\u2019t misunderstand why I have come. I did not come to abolish the law of Moses or the writings of the prophets. No
 I came to accomplish their purpose.","I tell you the truth
 until heaven and earth disappear
 not even the smallest detail of God\u2019s law will disappear until its purpose is achieved.","So if you ignore the least commandment and teach others to do the same
 you will be called the least in the Kingdom of Heaven. But anyone who obeys God\u2019s laws and teaches them will be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven.","\u201cBut I warn you\u2014unless your righteousness is better than the righteousness of the teachers of religious law and the Pharisees
 you will never enter the Kingdom of Heaven!","\u201cYou have heard that our ancestors were told
 \u2018You must not murder. If you commit murder
 you are subject to judgment.\u2019","But I say
 if you are even angry with someone
 you are subject to judgment! If you call someone an idiot
 you are in danger of being brought before the court. And if you curse someone
 you are in danger of the fires of hell.","\u201cSo if you are presenting a sacrifice at the altar in the Temple and you suddenly remember that someone has something against you
","leave your sacrifice there at the altar. Go and be reconciled to that person. Then come and offer your sacrifice to God.","\u201cWhen you are on the way to court with your adversary
 settle your differences quickly. Otherwise
 your accuser may hand you over to the judge
 who will hand you over to an officer
 and you will be thrown into prison.","And if that happens
 you surely won\u2019t be free again until you have paid the last penny.","\u201cYou have heard the commandment that says
 \u2018You must not commit adultery.\u2019","But I say
 anyone who even looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her in his heart.","So if your eye\u2014even your good eye\u2014causes you to lust
 gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.","And if your hand\u2014even your stronger hand\u2014causes you to sin
 cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.","\u201cYou have heard the law that says
 \u2018A man can divorce his wife by merely giving her a written notice of divorce.\u2019","But I say that a man who divorces his wife
 unless she has been unfaithful
 causes her to commit adultery. And anyone who marries a divorced woman also commits adultery.","\u201cYou have also heard that our ancestors were told
 \u2018You must not break your vows; you must carry out the vows you make to the Lord.\u2019","But I say
 do not make any vows! Do not say
 \u2018By heaven!\u2019 because heaven is God\u2019s throne.","And do not say
 \u2018By the earth!\u2019 because the earth is his footstool. And do not say
 \u2018By Jerusalem!\u2019 for Jerusalem is the city of the great King.","Do not even say
 \u2018By my head!\u2019 for you can\u2019t turn one hair white or black.","Just say a simple
 \u2018Yes
 I will
\u2019 or \u2018No
 I won\u2019t.\u2019 Anything beyond this is from the evil one.","\u201cYou have heard the law that says the punishment must match the injury: \u2018An eye for an eye
 and a tooth for a tooth.\u2019","But I say
 do not resist an evil person! If someone slaps you on the right cheek
 offer the other cheek also.","If you are sued in court and your shirt is taken from you
 give your coat
 too.","If a soldier demands that you carry his gear for a mile
 carry it two miles.","Give to those who ask
 and don\u2019t turn away from those who want to borrow.","\u201cYou have heard the law that says
 \u2018Love your neighbor\u2019 and hate your enemy.","But I say
 love your enemies! Pray for those who persecute you!","In that way
 you will be acting as true children of your Father in heaven. For he gives his sunlight to both the evil and the good
 and he sends rain on the just and the unjust alike.","If you love only those who love you
 what reward is there for that? Even corrupt tax collectors do that much.","If you are kind only to your friends
 how are you different from anyone else? Even pagans do that.","But you are to be perfect
 even as your Father in heaven is perfect.","\u201cWatch out! Don\u2019t do your good deeds publicly
 to be admired by others
 for you will lose the reward from your Father in heaven.","When you give to someone in need
 don\u2019t do as the hypocrites do\u2014blowing trumpets in the synagogues and streets to call attention to their acts of charity! I tell you the truth
 they have received all the reward they will ever get.","But when you give to someone in need
 don\u2019t let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.","Give your gifts in private
 and your Father
 who sees everything
 will reward you.","\u201cWhen you pray
 don\u2019t be like the hypocrites who love to pray publicly on street corners and in the synagogues where everyone can see them. I tell you the truth
 that is all the reward they will ever get.","But when you pray
 go away by yourself
 shut the door behind you
 and pray to your Father in private. Then your Father
 who sees everything
 will reward you.","\u201cWhen you pray
 don\u2019t babble on and on as the Gentiles do. They think their prayers are answered merely by repeating their words again and again.","Don\u2019t be like them
 for your Father knows exactly what you need even before you ask him!","Pray like this: Our Father in heaven
 may your name be kept holy.","May your Kingdom come soon. May your will be done on earth
 as it is in heaven.","Give us today the food we need
","and forgive us our sins
 as we have forgiven those who sin against us.","And don\u2019t let us yield to temptation
 but rescue us from the evil one.","\u201cIf you forgive those who sin against you
 your heavenly Father will forgive you.","But if you refuse to forgive others
 your Father will not forgive your sins.","\u201cAnd when you fast
 don\u2019t make it obvious
 as the hypocrites do
 for they try to look miserable and disheveled so people will admire them for their fasting. I tell you the truth
 that is the only reward they will ever get.","But when you fast
 comb your hair and wash your face.","Then no one will notice that you are fasting
 except your Father
 who knows what you do in private. And your Father
 who sees everything
 will reward you.","\u201cDon\u2019t store up treasures here on earth
 where moths eat them and rust destroys them
 and where thieves break in and steal.","Store your treasures in heaven
 where moths and rust cannot destroy
 and thieves do not break in and steal.","Wherever your treasure is
 there the desires of your heart will also be.","\u201cYour eye is like a lamp that provides light for your body. When your eye is healthy
 your whole body is filled with light.","But when your eye is unhealthy
 your whole body is filled with darkness. And if the light you think you have is actually darkness
 how deep that darkness is!","\u201cNo one can serve two masters. For you will hate one and love the other; you will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and be enslaved to money.","\u201cThat is why I tell you not to worry about everyday life\u2014whether you have enough food and drink
 or enough clothes to wear. Isn\u2019t life more than food
 and your body more than clothing?","Look at the birds. They don\u2019t plant or harvest or store food in barns
 for your heavenly Father feeds them. And aren\u2019t you far more valuable to him than they are?","Can all your worries add a single moment to your life?","\u201cAnd why worry about your clothing? Look at the lilies of the field and how they grow. They don\u2019t work or make their clothing
","yet Solomon in all his glory was not dressed as beautifully as they are.","And if God cares so wonderfully for wildflowers that are here today and thrown into the fire tomorrow
 he will certainly care for you. Why do you have so little faith?","\u201cSo don\u2019t worry about these things
 saying
 \u2018What will we eat? What will we drink? What will we wear?\u2019","These things dominate the thoughts of unbelievers
 but your heavenly Father already knows all your needs.","Seek the Kingdom of God above all else
 and live righteously
 and he will give you everything you need.","\u201cSo don\u2019t worry about tomorrow
 for tomorrow will bring its own worries. Today\u2019s trouble is enough for today.","\u201cDo not judge others
 and you will not be judged.","For you will be treated as you treat others. The standard you use in judging is the standard by which you will be judged.","\u201cAnd why worry about a speck in your friend\u2019s eye when you have a log in your own?","How can you think of saying to your friend
 \u2018Let me help you get rid of that speck in your eye
\u2019 when you can\u2019t see past the log in your own eye?","Hypocrite! First get rid of the log in your own eye; then you will see well enough to deal with the speck in your friend\u2019s eye.","\u201cDon\u2019t waste what is holy on people who are unholy. Don\u2019t throw your pearls to pigs! They will trample the pearls
 then turn and attack you.","\u201cKeep on asking
 and you will receive what you ask for. Keep on seeking
 and you will find. Keep on knocking
 and the door will be opened to you.","For everyone who asks
 receives. Everyone who seeks
 finds. And to everyone who knocks
 the door will be opened.","\u201cYou parents\u2014if your children ask for a loaf of bread
 do you give them a stone instead?","Or if they ask for a fish
 do you give them a snake? Of course not!","So if you sinful people know how to give good gifts to your children
 how much more will your heavenly Father give good gifts to those who ask him.","\u201cDo to others whatever you would like them to do to you. This is the essence of all that is taught in the law and the prophets.","\u201cYou can enter God\u2019s Kingdom only through the narrow gate. The highway to hell is broad
 and its gate is wide for the many who choose that way.","But the gateway to life is very narrow and the road is difficult
 and only a few ever find it.","\u201cBeware of false prophets who come disguised as harmless sheep but are really vicious wolves.","You can identify them by their fruit
 that is
 by the way they act. Can you pick grapes from thornbushes
 or figs from thistles?","A good tree produces good fruit
 and a bad tree produces bad fruit.","A good tree can\u2019t produce bad fruit
 and a bad tree can\u2019t produce good fruit.","So every tree that does not produce good fruit is chopped down and thrown into the fire.","Yes
 just as you can identify a tree by its fruit
 so you can identify people by their actions.","\u201cNot everyone who calls out to me
 \u2018Lord! Lord!\u2019 will enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Only those who actually do the will of my Father in heaven will enter.","On judgment day many will say to me
 \u2018Lord! Lord! We prophesied in your name and cast out demons in your name and performed many miracles in your name.\u2019","But I will reply
 \u2018I never knew you. Get away from me
 you who break God\u2019s laws.\u2019","\u201cAnyone who listens to my teaching and follows it is wise
 like a person who builds a house on solid rock.","Though the rain comes in torrents and the floodwaters rise and the winds beat against that house
 it won\u2019t collapse because it is built on bedrock.","But anyone who hears my teaching and doesn\u2019t obey it is foolish
 like a person who builds a house on sand.","When the rains and floods come and the winds beat against that house
 it will collapse with a mighty crash.\u201d","Jesus reached out and touched him. \u201cI am willing
\u201d he said. \u201cBe healed!\u201d And instantly the leprosy disappeared.","Then Jesus said to him
 \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone about this. Instead
 go to the priest and let him examine you. Take along the offering required in the law of Moses for those who have been healed of leprosy. This will be a public testimony that you have been cleansed.\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cI will come and heal him.\u201d","When Jesus heard this
 he was amazed. Turning to those who were following him
 he said
 \u201cI tell you the truth
 I haven\u2019t seen faith like this in all Israel!","And I tell you this
 that many Gentiles will come from all over the world\u2014from east and west\u2014and sit down with Abraham
 Isaac
 and Jacob at the feast in the Kingdom of Heaven.","But many Israelites\u2014those for whom the Kingdom was prepared\u2014will be thrown into outer darkness
 where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\u201d","Then Jesus said to the Roman officer
 \u201cGo back home. Because you believed
 it has happened.\u201d And the young servant was healed that same hour.","But Jesus replied
 \u201cFoxes have dens to live in
 and birds have nests
 but the Son of Man has no place even to lay his head.\u201d","But Jesus told him
 \u201cFollow me now. Let the spiritually dead bury their own dead.\u201d","Jesus responded
 \u201cWhy are you afraid? You have so little faith!\u201d Then he got up and rebuked the wind and waves
 and suddenly there was a great calm.","\u201cAll right
 go!\u201d Jesus commanded them. So the demons came out of the men and entered the pigs
 and the whole herd plunged down the steep hillside into the lake and drowned in the water.","Some people brought to him a paralyzed man on a mat. Seeing their faith
 Jesus said to the paralyzed man
 \u201cBe encouraged
 my child! Your sins are forgiven.\u201d","Jesus knew what they were thinking
 so he asked them
 \u201cWhy do you have such evil thoughts in your hearts?","Is it easier to say \u2018Your sins are forgiven
\u2019 or \u2018Stand up and walk\u2019?","So I will prove to you that the Son of Man has the authority on earth to forgive sins.\u201d Then Jesus turned to the paralyzed man and said
 \u201cStand up
 pick up your mat
 and go home!\u201d","As Jesus was walking along
 he saw a man named Matthew sitting at his tax collector\u2019s booth. \u201cFollow me and be my disciple
\u201d Jesus said to him. So Matthew got up and followed him.","When Jesus heard this
 he said
 \u201cHealthy people don\u2019t need a doctor\u2014sick people do.\u201d","Then he added
 \u201cNow go and learn the meaning of this Scripture: \u2018I want you to show mercy
 not offer sacrifices.\u2019 For I have come to call not those who think they are righteous
 but those who know they are sinners.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cDo wedding guests mourn while celebrating with the groom? Of course not. But someday the groom will be taken away from them
 and then they will fast.","\u201cBesides
 who would patch old clothing with new cloth? For the new patch would shrink and rip away from the old cloth
 leaving an even bigger tear than before.","\u201cAnd no one puts new wine into old wineskins. For the old skins would burst from the pressure
 spilling the wine and ruining the skins. New wine is stored in new wineskins so that both are preserved.\u201d","Jesus turned around
 and when he saw her he said
 \u201cDaughter
 be encouraged! Your faith has made you well.\u201d And the woman was healed at that moment.","\u201cGet out!\u201d he told them. \u201cThe girl isn\u2019t dead; she\u2019s only asleep.\u201d But the crowd laughed at him.","They went right into the house where he was staying
 and Jesus asked them
 \u201cDo you believe I can make you see?\u201d \u201cYes
 Lord
\u201d they told him
 \u201cwe do.\u201d","Then their eyes were opened
 and they could see! Jesus sternly warned them
 \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone about this.\u201d","He said to his disciples
 \u201cThe harvest is great
 but the workers are few.","So pray to the Lord who is in charge of the harvest; ask him to send more workers into his fields.\u201d","Jesus sent out the twelve apostles with these instructions: \u201cDon\u2019t go to the Gentiles or the Samaritans
","but only to the people of Israel\u2014God\u2019s lost sheep.","Go and announce to them that the Kingdom of Heaven is near.","Heal the sick
 raise the dead
 cure those with leprosy
 and cast out demons. Give as freely as you have received!","\u201cDon\u2019t take any money in your money belts\u2014no gold
 silver
 or even copper coins.","Don\u2019t carry a traveler\u2019s bag with a change of clothes and sandals or even a walking stick. Don\u2019t hesitate to accept hospitality
 because those who work deserve to be fed.","\u201cWhenever you enter a city or village
 search for a worthy person and stay in his home until you leave town.","When you enter the home
 give it your blessing.","If it turns out to be a worthy home
 let your blessing stand; if it is not
 take back the blessing.","If any household or town refuses to welcome you or listen to your message
 shake its dust from your feet as you leave.","I tell you the truth
 the wicked cities of Sodom and Gomorrah will be better off than such a town on the judgment day.","\u201cLook
 I am sending you out as sheep among wolves. So be as shrewd as snakes and harmless as doves.","But beware! For you will be handed over to the courts and will be flogged with whips in the synagogues.","You will stand trial before governors and kings because you are my followers. But this will be your opportunity to tell the rulers and other unbelievers about me.","When you are arrested
 don\u2019t worry about how to respond or what to say. God will give you the right words at the right time.","For it is not you who will be speaking\u2014it will be the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.","\u201cA brother will betray his brother to death
 a father will betray his own child
 and children will rebel against their parents and cause them to be killed.","And all nations will hate you because you are my followers. But everyone who endures to the end will be saved.","When you are persecuted in one town
 flee to the next. I tell you the truth
 the Son of Man will return before you have reached all the towns of Israel.","\u201cStudents are not greater than their teacher
 and slaves are not greater than their master.","Students are to be like their teacher
 and slaves are to be like their master. And since I
 the master of the household
 have been called the prince of demons
 the members of my household will be called by even worse names!","\u201cBut don\u2019t be afraid of those who threaten you. For the time is coming when everything that is covered will be revealed
 and all that is secret will be made known to all.","What I tell you now in the darkness
 shout abroad when daybreak comes. What I whisper in your ear
 shout from the housetops for all to hear!","\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid of those who want to kill your body; they cannot touch your soul. Fear only God
 who can destroy both soul and body in hell.","What is the price of two sparrows\u2014one copper coin? But not a single sparrow can fall to the ground without your Father knowing it.","And the very hairs on your head are all numbered.","So don\u2019t be afraid; you are more valuable to God than a whole flock of sparrows.","\u201cEveryone who acknowledges me publicly here on earth
 I will also acknowledge before my Father in heaven.","But everyone who denies me here on earth
 I will also deny before my Father in heaven.","\u201cDon\u2019t imagine that I came to bring peace to the earth! I came not to bring peace
 but a sword.","\u2018I have come to set a man against his father
 a daughter against her mother
 and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.","Your enemies will be right in your own household!\u2019","\u201cIf you love your father or mother more than you love me
 you are not worthy of being mine; or if you love your son or daughter more than me

 you are not worthy of being mine.","If you cling to your life
 you will lose it; but if you give up your life for me
 you will find it.","\u201cAnyone who receives you receives me
 and anyone who receives me receives the Father who sent me.","If you receive a prophet as one who speaks for God
 you will be given the same reward as a prophet. And if you receive righteous people because of their righteousness
 you will be given a reward like theirs.","And if you give even a cup of cold water to one of the least of my followers
 you will surely be rewarded.\u201d","Jesus told them
 \u201cGo back to John and tell him what you have heard and seen\u2014","the blind see

 \u201cGod blesses those who do not fall away because of me.\u201d","As John\u2019s disciples were leaving
 Jesus began talking about him to the crowds. \u201cWhat kind of man did you go into the wilderness to see? Was he a weak reed
 swayed by every breath of wind?","Or were you expecting to see a man dressed in expensive clothes? No
 people with expensive clothes live in palaces.","Were you looking for a prophet? Yes

 \u2018Look
 I am sending my messenger ahead of you

 of all who have ever lived
 none is greater than John the Baptist. Yet even the least person in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he is!","And from the time John the Baptist began preaching until now
 the Kingdom of Heaven has been forcefully advancing
 and violent people are attacking it.","For before John came
 all the prophets and the law of Moses looked forward to this present time.","And if you are willing to accept what I say
 he is Elijah
 the one the prophets said would come.","Anyone with ears to hear should listen and understand!","\u201cTo what can I compare this generation? It is like children playing a game in the public square. They complain to their friends
","\u2018We played wedding songs
 and you didn\u2019t dance
 so we played funeral songs
 and you didn\u2019t mourn.\u2019","For John didn\u2019t spend his time eating and drinking
 and you say
 \u2018He\u2019s possessed by a demon.\u2019","The Son of Man
 on the other hand
 feasts and drinks
 and you say
 \u2018He\u2019s a glutton and a drunkard
 and a friend of tax collectors and other sinners!\u2019 But wisdom is shown to be right by its results.\u201d","Then Jesus began to denounce the towns where he had done so many of his miracles
 because they hadn\u2019t repented of their sins and turned to God.","\u201cWhat sorrow awaits you
 Korazin and Bethsaida! For if the miracles I did in you had been done in wicked Tyre and Sidon
 their people would have repented of their sins long ago
 clothing themselves in burlap and throwing ashes on their heads to show their remorse.","I tell you
 Tyre and Sidon will be better off on judgment day than you.","\u201cAnd you people of Capernaum
 will you be honored in heaven? No
 you will go down to the place of the dead. For if the miracles I did for you had been done in wicked Sodom
 it would still be here today.","I tell you
 even Sodom will be better off on judgment day than you.\u201d","At that time Jesus prayed this prayer: \u201cO Father
 Lord of heaven and earth
 thank you for hiding these things from those who think themselves wise and clever
 and for revealing them to the childlike.","Yes
 Father
 it pleased you to do it this way!","\u201cMy Father has entrusted everything to me. No one truly knows the Son except the Father

 \u201cCome to me
 all of you who are weary and carry heavy burdens
 and I will give you rest.","Take my yoke upon you. Let me teach you
 because I am humble and gentle at heart

 there is one here who is even greater than the Temple!","But you would not have condemned my innocent disciples if you knew the meaning of this Scripture: \u2018I want you to show mercy

 \u201cHold out your hand.\u201d So the man held out his hand

 \u201cAny kingdom divided by civil war is doomed. A town or family splintered by feuding will fall apart.","And if Satan is casting out Satan
 he is divided and fighting against himself. His own kingdom will not survive.","And if I am empowered by Satan
 what about your own exorcists? They cast out demons
 too

 every sin and blasphemy can be forgiven\u2014except blasphemy against the Holy Spirit

 its fruit will be good. If a tree is bad
 its fruit will be bad.","You brood of snakes! How could evil men like you speak what is good and right? For whatever is in your heart determines what you say.","A good person produces good things from the treasury of a good heart

 you must give an account on judgment day for every idle word you speak.","The words you say will either acquit you or condemn you.\u201d","But Jesus replied
 \u201cOnly an evil
 adulterous generation would demand a miraculous sign; but the only sign I will give them is the sign of the prophet Jonah.","For as Jonah was in the belly of the great fish for three days and three nights

 and in order.","Then the spirit finds seven other spirits more evil than itself
 and they all enter the person and live there. And so that person is worse off than before. That will be the experience of this evil generation.\u201d","As Jesus was speaking to the crowd
 his mother and brothers stood outside
 asking to speak to him.","Jesus asked
 \u201cWho is my mother? Who are my brothers?\u201d","Then he pointed to his disciples and said
 \u201cLook
 these are my mother and brothers.","Anyone who does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother!\u201d","He told many stories in the form of parables
 such as this one: \u201cListen! A farmer went out to plant some seeds.","As he scattered them across his field
 some seeds fell on a footpath
 and the birds came and ate them.","Other seeds fell on shallow soil with underlying rock. The seeds sprouted quickly because the soil was shallow.","But the plants soon wilted under the hot sun
 and since they didn\u2019t have deep roots
 they died.","Other seeds fell among thorns that grew up and choked out the tender plants.","Still other seeds fell on fertile soil
 and they produced a crop that was thirty
 sixty
 and even a hundred times as much as had been planted!","Anyone with ears to hear should listen and understand.\u201d","He replied
 \u201cYou are permitted to understand the secrets of the Kingdom of Heaven
 but others are not.","To those who listen to my teaching
 more understanding will be given
 and they will have an abundance of knowledge. But for those who are not listening
 even what little understanding they have will be taken away from them.","That is why I use these parables
 For they look
 but they don\u2019t really see. They hear
 but they don\u2019t really listen or understand.","This fulfills the prophecy of Isaiah that says
 \u2018When you hear what I say
 you will not understand. When you see what I do
 you will not comprehend.","For the hearts of these people are hardened
 and their ears cannot hear
 and they have closed their eyes\u2014 so their eyes cannot see
 and their ears cannot hear
 and their hearts cannot understand
 and they cannot turn to me and let me heal them.\u2019","\u201cBut blessed are your eyes
 because they see; and your ears
 because they hear.","I tell you the truth
 many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see
 but they didn\u2019t see it. And they longed to hear what you hear
 but they didn\u2019t hear it.","\u201cNow listen to the explanation of the parable about the farmer planting seeds:","The seed that fell on the footpath represents those who hear the message about the Kingdom and don\u2019t understand it. Then the evil one comes and snatches away the seed that was planted in their hearts.","The seed on the rocky soil represents those who hear the message and immediately receive it with joy.","But since they don\u2019t have deep roots
 they don\u2019t last long. They fall away as soon as they have problems or are persecuted for believing God\u2019s word.","The seed that fell among the thorns represents those who hear God\u2019s word
 but all too quickly the message is crowded out by the worries of this life and the lure of wealth
 so no fruit is produced.","The seed that fell on good soil represents those who truly hear and understand God\u2019s word and produce a harvest of thirty
 sixty
 or even a hundred times as much as had been planted!\u201d","Here is another story Jesus told: \u201cThe Kingdom of Heaven is like a farmer who planted good seed in his field.","But that night as the workers slept
 his enemy came and planted weeds among the wheat
 then slipped away.","When the crop began to grow and produce grain
 the weeds also grew.","\u201cThe farmer\u2019s workers went to him and said
 \u2018Sir
 the field where you planted that good seed is full of weeds! Where did they come from?\u2019","\u201c\u2018An enemy has done this!\u2019 the farmer exclaimed. \u201c\u2018Should we pull out the weeds?\u2019 they asked.","\u201c\u2018No
\u2019 he replied
 \u2018you\u2019ll uproot the wheat if you do.","Let both grow together until the harvest. Then I will tell the harvesters to sort out the weeds
 tie them into bundles
 and burn them
 and to put the wheat in the barn.\u2019\u201d","Here is another illustration Jesus used: \u201cThe Kingdom of Heaven is like a mustard seed planted in a field.","It is the smallest of all seeds
 but it becomes the largest of garden plants; it grows into a tree
 and birds come and make nests in its branches.\u201d","Jesus also used this illustration: \u201cThe Kingdom of Heaven is like the yeast a woman used in making bread. Even though she put only a little yeast in three measures of flour
 it permeated every part of the dough.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cThe Son of Man is the farmer who plants the good seed.","The field is the world
 and the good seed represents the people of the Kingdom. The weeds are the people who belong to the evil one.","The enemy who planted the weeds among the wheat is the devil. The harvest is the end of the world
 and the harvesters are the angels.","\u201cJust as the weeds are sorted out and burned in the fire
 so it will be at the end of the world.","The Son of Man will send his angels
 and they will remove from his Kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil.","And the angels will throw them into the fiery furnace
 where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.","Then the righteous will shine like the sun in their Father\u2019s Kingdom. Anyone with ears to hear should listen and understand!","\u201cThe Kingdom of Heaven is like a treasure that a man discovered hidden in a field. In his excitement
 he hid it again and sold everything he owned to get enough money to buy the field.","\u201cAgain
 the Kingdom of Heaven is like a merchant on the lookout for choice pearls.","When he discovered a pearl of great value
 he sold everything he owned and bought it!","\u201cAgain
 the Kingdom of Heaven is like a fishing net that was thrown into the water and caught fish of every kind.","When the net was full
 they dragged it up onto the shore
 sat down
 and sorted the good fish into crates
 but threw the bad ones away.","That is the way it will be at the end of the world. The angels will come and separate the wicked people from the righteous
","throwing the wicked into the fiery furnace
 where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.","Do you understand all these things?\u201d \u201cYes
\u201d they said
 \u201cwe do.\u201d","Then he added
 \u201cEvery teacher of religious law who becomes a disciple in the Kingdom of Heaven is like a homeowner who brings from his storeroom new gems of truth as well as old.\u201d","And they were deeply offended and refused to believe in him. Then Jesus told them
 \u201cA prophet is honored everywhere except in his own hometown and among his own family.\u201d","But Jesus said
 \u201cThat isn\u2019t necessary\u2014you feed them.\u201d","\u201cBring them here
\u201d he said.","But Jesus spoke to them at once. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid
\u201d he said. \u201cTake courage. I am here!\u201d","\u201cYes
 come
\u201d Jesus said. So Peter went over the side of the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus.","Jesus immediately reached out and grabbed him. \u201cYou have so little faith
\u201d Jesus said. \u201cWhy did you doubt me?\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cAnd why do you
 by your traditions
 violate the direct commandments of God?","For instance
 God says
 \u2018Honor your father and mother
\u2019 and \u2018Anyone who speaks disrespectfully of father or mother must be put to death.\u2019","But you say it is all right for people to say to their parents
 \u2018Sorry
 I can\u2019t help you. For I have vowed to give to God what I would have given to you.\u2019","In this way
 you say they don\u2019t need to honor their parents. And so you cancel the word of God for the sake of your own tradition.","You hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you
 for he wrote
","\u2018These people honor me with their lips
 but their hearts are far from me.","Their worship is a farce
 for they teach man-made ideas as commands from God.\u2019\u201d","Then Jesus called to the crowd to come and hear. \u201cListen
\u201d he said
 \u201cand try to understand.","It\u2019s not what goes into your mouth that defiles you; you are defiled by the words that come out of your mouth.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cEvery plant not planted by my heavenly Father will be uprooted
","so ignore them. They are blind guides leading the blind
 and if one blind person guides another
 they will both fall into a ditch.\u201d","\u201cDon\u2019t you understand yet?\u201d Jesus asked.","\u201cAnything you eat passes through the stomach and then goes into the sewer.","But the words you speak come from the heart\u2014that\u2019s what defiles you.","For from the heart come evil thoughts
 murder
 adultery
 all sexual immorality
 theft
 lying
 and slander.","These are what defile you. Eating with unwashed hands will never defile you.\u201d","Then Jesus said to the woman
 \u201cI was sent only to help God\u2019s lost sheep\u2014the people of Israel.\u201d","Jesus responded
 \u201cIt isn\u2019t right to take food from the children and throw it to the dogs.\u201d","\u201cDear woman
\u201d Jesus said to her
 \u201cyour faith is great. Your request is granted.\u201d And her daughter was instantly healed.","Then Jesus called his disciples and told them
 \u201cI feel sorry for these people. They have been here with me for three days
 and they have nothing left to eat. I don\u2019t want to send them away hungry
 or they will faint along the way.\u201d","Jesus asked
 \u201cHow much bread do you have?\u201d They replied
 \u201cSeven loaves
 and a few small fish.\u201d","He replied
 \u201cYou know the saying
 \u2018Red sky at night means fair weather tomorrow;","red sky in the morning means foul weather all day.\u2019 You know how to interpret the weather signs in the sky
 but you don\u2019t know how to interpret the signs of the times!","Only an evil
 adulterous generation would demand a miraculous sign
 but the only sign I will give them is the sign of the prophet Jonah.\u201d Then Jesus left them and went away.","\u201cWatch out!\u201d Jesus warned them. \u201cBeware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\u201d","Jesus knew what they were saying
 so he said
 \u201cYou have so little faith! Why are you arguing with each other about having no bread?","Don\u2019t you understand even yet? Don\u2019t you remember the 5
000 I fed with five loaves
 and the baskets of leftovers you picked up?","Or the 4
000 I fed with seven loaves
 and the large baskets of leftovers you picked up?","Why can\u2019t you understand that I\u2019m not talking about bread? So again I say
 \u2018Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\u2019\u201d","When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi
 he asked his disciples
 \u201cWho do people say that the Son of Man is?\u201d","Then he asked them
 \u201cBut who do you say I am?\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cYou are blessed
 Simon son of John
 because my Father in heaven has revealed this to you. You did not learn this from any human being.","Now I say to you that you are Peter (which means \u2018rock\u2019)
 and upon this rock I will build my church
 and all the powers of hell will not conquer it.","And I will give you the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven. Whatever you forbid on earth will be forbidden in heaven
 and whatever you permit on earth will be permitted in heaven.\u201d","Jesus turned to Peter and said
 \u201cGet away from me
 Satan! You are a dangerous trap to me. You are seeing things merely from a human point of view
 not from God\u2019s.\u201d","Then Jesus said to his disciples
 \u201cIf any of you wants to be my follower
 you must give up your own way
 take up your cross
 and follow me.","If you try to hang on to your life
 you will lose it. But if you give up your life for my sake
 you will save it.","And what do you benefit if you gain the whole world but lose your own soul? Is anything worth more than your soul?","For the Son of Man will come with his angels in the glory of his Father and will judge all people according to their deeds.","And I tell you the truth
 some standing here right now will not die before they see the Son of Man coming in his Kingdom.\u201d","Then Jesus came over and touched them. \u201cGet up
\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid.\u201d","As they went back down the mountain
 Jesus commanded them
 \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone what you have seen until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cElijah is indeed coming first to get everything ready.","But I tell you
 Elijah has already come
 but he wasn\u2019t recognized
 and they chose to abuse him. And in the same way they will also make the Son of Man suffer.\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cYou faithless and corrupt people! How long must I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring the boy here to me.\u201d","\u201cYou don\u2019t have enough faith
\u201d Jesus told them. \u201cI tell you the truth
 if you had faith even as small as a mustard seed
 you could say to this mountain
 \u2018Move from here to there
\u2019 and it would move. Nothing would be impossible.\u201d","After they gathered again in Galilee
 Jesus told them
 \u201cThe Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of his enemies.","He will be killed
 but on the third day he will be raised from the dead.\u201d And the disciples were filled with grief.","\u201cYes
 he does
\u201d Peter replied. Then he went into the house. But before he had a chance to speak
 Jesus asked him
 \u201cWhat do you think
 Peter? Do kings tax their own people or the people they have conquered?\u201d","\u201cThey tax the people they have conquered
\u201d Peter replied. \u201cWell
 then
\u201d Jesus said
 \u201cthe citizens are free!","However
 we don\u2019t want to offend them
 so go down to the lake and throw in a line. Open the mouth of the first fish you catch
 and you will find a large silver coin. Take it and pay the tax for both of us.\u201d","Then he said
 \u201cI tell you the truth
 unless you turn from your sins and become like little children
 you will never get into the Kingdom of Heaven.","So anyone who becomes as humble as this little child is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven.","\u201cAnd anyone who welcomes a little child like this on my behalf is welcoming me.","But if you cause one of these little ones who trusts in me to fall into sin
 it would be better for you to have a large millstone tied around your neck and be drowned in the depths of the sea.","\u201cWhat sorrow awaits the world
 because it tempts people to sin. Temptations are inevitable
 but what sorrow awaits the person who does the tempting.","So if your hand or foot causes you to sin
 cut it off and throw it away. It\u2019s better to enter eternal life with only one hand or one foot than to be thrown into eternal fire with both of your hands and feet.","And if your eye causes you to sin
 gouge it out and throw it away. It\u2019s better to enter eternal life with only one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell.","\u201cBeware that you don\u2019t look down on any of these little ones. For I tell you that in heaven their angels are always in the presence of my heavenly Father.","\u201cIf a man has a hundred sheep and one of them wanders away
 what will he do? Won\u2019t he leave the ninety-nine others on the hills and go out to search for the one that is lost?","And if he finds it
 I tell you the truth
 he will rejoice over it more than over the ninety-nine that didn\u2019t wander away!","In the same way
 it is not my heavenly Father\u2019s will that even one of these little ones should perish.","\u201cIf another believer sins against you
 go privately and point out the offense. If the other person listens and confesses it
 you have won that person back.","But if you are unsuccessful
 take one or two others with you and go back again
 so that everything you say may be confirmed by two or three witnesses.","If the person still refuses to listen
 take your case to the church. Then if he or she won\u2019t accept the church\u2019s decision
 treat that person as a pagan or a corrupt tax collector.","\u201cI tell you the truth
 whatever you forbid on earth will be forbidden in heaven
 and whatever you permit on earth will be permitted in heaven.","\u201cI also tell you this: If two of you agree here on earth concerning anything you ask
 my Father in heaven will do it for you.","For where two or three gather together as my followers
 I am there among them.\u201d","\u201cNo
 not seven times
\u201d Jesus replied
 \u201cbut seventy times seven!","\u201cTherefore
 the Kingdom of Heaven can be compared to a king who decided to bring his accounts up to date with servants who had borrowed money from him.","In the process
 one of his debtors was brought in who owed him millions of dollars.","He couldn\u2019t pay
 so his master ordered that he be sold\u2014along with his wife
 his children
 and everything he owned\u2014to pay the debt.","\u201cBut the man fell down before his master and begged him
 \u2018Please
 be patient with me
 and I will pay it all.\u2019","Then his master was filled with pity for him
 and he released him and forgave his debt.","\u201cBut when the man left the king
 he went to a fellow servant who owed him a few thousand dollars. He grabbed him by the throat and demanded instant payment.","\u201cHis fellow servant fell down before him and begged for a little more time. \u2018Be patient with me
 and I will pay it
\u2019 he pleaded.","But his creditor wouldn\u2019t wait. He had the man arrested and put in prison until the debt could be paid in full.","\u201cWhen some of the other servants saw this
 they were very upset. They went to the king and told him everything that had happened.","Then the king called in the man he had forgiven and said
 \u2018You evil servant! I forgave you that tremendous debt because you pleaded with me.","Shouldn\u2019t you have mercy on your fellow servant
 just as I had mercy on you?\u2019","Then the angry king sent the man to prison to be tortured until he had paid his entire debt.","\u201cThat\u2019s what my heavenly Father will do to you if you refuse to forgive your brothers and sisters from your heart.\u201d","\u201cHaven\u2019t you read the Scriptures?\u201d Jesus replied. \u201cThey record that from the beginning \u2018God made them male and female.\u2019\u201d","And he said
 \u201c\u2018This explains why a man leaves his father and mother and is joined to his wife
 and the two are united into one.\u2019","Since they are no longer two but one
 let no one split apart what God has joined together.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cMoses permitted divorce only as a concession to your hard hearts
 but it was not what God had originally intended.","And I tell you this
 whoever divorces his wife and marries someone else commits adultery\u2014unless his wife has been unfaithful.\u201d","\u201cNot everyone can accept this statement
\u201d Jesus said. \u201cOnly those whom God helps.","Some are born as eunuchs
 some have been made eunuchs by others
 and some choose not to marry for the sake of the Kingdom of Heaven. Let anyone accept this who can.\u201d","But Jesus said
 \u201cLet the children come to me. Don\u2019t stop them! For the Kingdom of Heaven belongs to those who are like these children.\u201d","\u201cWhy ask me about what is good?\u201d Jesus replied. \u201cThere is only One who is good. But to answer your question\u2014if you want to receive eternal life
 keep the commandments.\u201d","\u201cWhich ones?\u201d the man asked. And Jesus replied: \u201c\u2018You must not murder. You must not commit adultery. You must not steal. You must not testify falsely.","Honor your father and mother. Love your neighbor as yourself.\u2019\u201d","Jesus told him
 \u201cIf you want to be perfect
 go and sell all your possessions and give the money to the poor
 and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come
 follow me.\u201d","Then Jesus said to his disciples
 \u201cI tell you the truth
 it is very hard for a rich person to enter the Kingdom of Heaven.","I\u2019ll say it again\u2014it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the Kingdom of God!\u201d","Jesus looked at them intently and said
 \u201cHumanly speaking
 it is impossible. But with God everything is possible.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cI assure you that when the world is made new and the Son of Man sits upon his glorious throne
 you who have been my followers will also sit on twelve thrones
 judging the twelve tribes of Israel.","And everyone who has given up houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or property
 for my sake
 will receive a hundred times as much in return and will inherit eternal life.","But many who are the greatest now will be least important then
 and those who seem least important now will be the greatest then.","\u201cFor the Kingdom of Heaven is like the landowner who went out early one morning to hire workers for his vineyard.","He agreed to pay the normal daily wage and sent them out to work.","\u201cAt nine o\u2019clock in the morning he was passing through the marketplace and saw some people standing around doing nothing.","So he hired them
 telling them he would pay them whatever was right at the end of the day.","So they went to work in the vineyard. At noon and again at three o\u2019clock he did the same thing.","\u201cAt five o\u2019clock that afternoon he was in town again and saw some more people standing around. He asked them
 \u2018Why haven\u2019t you been working today?\u2019","\u201cThey replied
 \u2018Because no one hired us.\u2019 \u201cThe landowner told them
 \u2018Then go out and join the others in my vineyard.\u2019","\u201cThat evening he told the foreman to call the workers in and pay them
 beginning with the last workers first.","When those hired at five o\u2019clock were paid
 each received a full day\u2019s wage.","When those hired first came to get their pay
 they assumed they would receive more. But they
 too
 were paid a day\u2019s wage.","When they received their pay
 they protested to the owner
","\u2018Those people worked only one hour
 and yet you\u2019ve paid them just as much as you paid us who worked all day in the scorching heat.\u2019","\u201cHe answered one of them
 \u2018Friend
 I haven\u2019t been unfair! Didn\u2019t you agree to work all day for the usual wage?","Take your money and go. I wanted to pay this last worker the same as you.","Is it against the law for me to do what I want with my money? Should you be jealous because I am kind to others?\u2019","\u201cSo those who are last now will be first then
 and those who are first will be last.\u201d","\u201cListen
\u201d he said
 \u201cwe\u2019re going up to Jerusalem
 where the Son of Man will be betrayed to the leading priests and the teachers of religious law. They will sentence him to die.","Then they will hand him over to the Romans to be mocked
 flogged with a whip
 and crucified. But on the third day he will be raised from the dead.\u201d","\u201cWhat is your request?\u201d he asked. She replied
 \u201cIn your Kingdom
 please let my two sons sit in places of honor next to you
 one on your right and the other on your left.\u201d","But Jesus answered by saying to them
 \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you are asking! Are you able to drink from the bitter cup of suffering I am about to drink?\u201d \u201cOh yes
\u201d they replied
 \u201cwe are able!\u201d","But Jesus called them together and said
 \u201cYou know that the rulers in this world lord it over their people
 and officials flaunt their authority over those under them.","But among you it will be different. Whoever wants to be a leader among you must be your servant
","and whoever wants to be first among you must become your slave.","For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve others and to give his life as a ransom for many.\u201d","When Jesus heard them
 he stopped and called
 \u201cWhat do you want me to do for you?\u201d","\u201cGo into the village over there
\u201d he said. \u201cAs soon as you enter it
 you will see a donkey tied there
 with its colt beside it. Untie them and bring them to me.","If anyone asks what you are doing
 just say
 \u2018The Lord needs them
\u2019 and he will immediately let you take them.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cThe Scriptures declare
 \u2018My Temple will be called a house of prayer
\u2019 but you have turned it into a den of thieves!\u201d","They asked Jesus
 \u201cDo you hear what these children are saying?\u201d \u201cYes
\u201d Jesus replied. \u201cHaven\u2019t you ever read the Scriptures? For they say
 \u2018You have taught children and infants to give you praise.\u2019\u201d","and he noticed a fig tree beside the road. He went over to see if there were any figs
 but there were only leaves. Then he said to it
 \u201cMay you never bear fruit again!\u201d And immediately the fig tree withered up.","Then Jesus told them
 \u201cI tell you the truth
 if you have faith and don\u2019t doubt
 you can do things like this and much more. You can even say to this mountain
 \u2018May you be lifted up and thrown into the sea
\u2019 and it will happen.","You can pray for anything
 and if you have faith
 you will receive it.\u201d","\u201cI\u2019ll tell you by what authority I do these things if you answer one question
\u201d Jesus replied.","\u201cDid John\u2019s authority to baptize come from heaven
 or was it merely human?\u201d They talked it over among themselves. \u201cIf we say it was from heaven
 he will ask us why we didn\u2019t believe John.","So they finally replied
 \u201cWe don\u2019t know.\u201d And Jesus responded
 \u201cThen I won\u2019t tell you by what authority I do these things.","\u201cBut what do you think about this? A man with two sons told the older boy
 \u2018Son
 go out and work in the vineyard today.\u2019","The son answered
 \u2018No
 I won\u2019t go
\u2019 but later he changed his mind and went anyway.","Then the father told the other son
 \u2018You go
\u2019 and he said
 \u2018Yes
 sir
 I will.\u2019 But he didn\u2019t go.","\u201cWhich of the two obeyed his father?\u201d They replied
 \u201cThe first.\u201d Then Jesus explained his meaning: \u201cI tell you the truth
 corrupt tax collectors and prostitutes will get into the Kingdom of God before you do.","For John the Baptist came and showed you the right way to live
 but you didn\u2019t believe him
 while tax collectors and prostitutes did. And even when you saw this happening
 you refused to believe him and repent of your sins.","\u201cNow listen to another story. A certain landowner planted a vineyard
 built a wall around it
 dug a pit for pressing out the grape juice
 and built a lookout tower. Then he leased the vineyard to tenant farmers and moved to another country.","At the time of the grape harvest
 he sent his servants to collect his share of the crop.","But the farmers grabbed his servants
 beat one
 killed one
 and stoned another.","So the landowner sent a larger group of his servants to collect for him
 but the results were the same.","\u201cFinally
 the owner sent his son
 thinking
 \u2018Surely they will respect my son.\u2019","\u201cBut when the tenant farmers saw his son coming
 they said to one another
 \u2018Here comes the heir to this estate. Come on
 let\u2019s kill him and get the estate for ourselves!\u2019","So they grabbed him
 dragged him out of the vineyard
 and murdered him.","\u201cWhen the owner of the vineyard returns
\u201d Jesus asked
 \u201cwhat do you think he will do to those farmers?\u201d","The religious leaders replied
 \u201cHe will put the wicked men to a horrible death and lease the vineyard to others who will give him his share of the crop after each harvest.\u201d","Then Jesus asked them
 \u201cDidn\u2019t you ever read this in the Scriptures? \u2018The stone that the builders rejected has now become the cornerstone. This is the Lord\u2019s doing
 and it is wonderful to see.\u2019","I tell you
 the Kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a nation that will produce the proper fruit.","Anyone who stumbles over that stone will be broken to pieces
 and it will crush anyone it falls on.\u201d","\u201cThe Kingdom of Heaven can be illustrated by the story of a king who prepared a great wedding feast for his son.","When the banquet was ready
 he sent his servants to notify those who were invited. But they all refused to come!","\u201cSo he sent other servants to tell them
 \u2018The feast has been prepared. The bulls and fattened cattle have been killed
 and everything is ready. Come to the banquet!\u2019","But the guests he had invited ignored them and went their own way
 one to his farm
 another to his business.","Others seized his messengers and insulted them and killed them.","\u201cThe king was furious
 and he sent out his army to destroy the murderers and burn their town.","And he said to his servants
 \u2018The wedding feast is ready
 and the guests I invited aren\u2019t worthy of the honor.","Now go out to the street corners and invite everyone you see.\u2019","So the servants brought in everyone they could find
 good and bad alike
 and the banquet hall was filled with guests.","\u201cBut when the king came in to meet the guests
 he noticed a man who wasn\u2019t wearing the proper clothes for a wedding.","\u2018Friend
\u2019 he asked
 \u2018how is it that you are here without wedding clothes?\u2019 But the man had no reply.","Then the king said to his aides
 \u2018Bind his hands and feet and throw him into the outer darkness
 where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\u2019","\u201cFor many are called
 but few are chosen.\u201d","But Jesus knew their evil motives. \u201cYou hypocrites!\u201d he said. \u201cWhy are you trying to trap me?","Here
 show me the coin used for the tax.\u201d When they handed him a Roman coin
","he asked
 \u201cWhose picture and title are stamped on it?\u201d","\u201cCaesar\u2019s
\u201d they replied. \u201cWell
 then
\u201d he said
 \u201cgive to Caesar what belongs to Caesar
 and give to God what belongs to God.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cYour mistake is that you don\u2019t know the Scriptures
 and you don\u2019t know the power of God.","For when the dead rise
 they will neither marry nor be given in marriage. In this respect they will be like the angels in heaven.","\u201cBut now
 as to whether there will be a resurrection of the dead\u2014haven\u2019t you ever read about this in the Scriptures? Long after Abraham
 Isaac
 and Jacob had died
 God said
","\u2018I am the God of Abraham
 the God of Isaac
 and the God of Jacob.\u2019 So he is the God of the living
 not the dead.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201c\u2018You must love the Lord your God with all your heart
 all your soul
 and all your mind.\u2019","This is the first and greatest commandment.","A second is equally important: \u2018Love your neighbor as yourself.\u2019","The entire law and all the demands of the prophets are based on these two commandments.\u201d","\u201cWhat do you think about the Messiah? Whose son is he?\u201d They replied
 \u201cHe is the son of David.\u201d","Jesus responded
 \u201cThen why does David
 speaking under the inspiration of the Spirit
 call the Messiah \u2018my Lord\u2019? For David said
","\u2018The Lord said to my Lord
 Sit in the place of honor at my right hand until I humble your enemies beneath your feet.\u2019","Since David called the Messiah \u2018my Lord
\u2019 how can the Messiah be his son?\u201d","\u201cThe teachers of religious law and the Pharisees are the official interpreters of the law of Moses.","So practice and obey whatever they tell you
 but don\u2019t follow their example. For they don\u2019t practice what they teach.","They crush people with unbearable religious demands and never lift a finger to ease the burden.","\u201cEverything they do is for show. On their arms they wear extra wide prayer boxes with Scripture verses inside
 and they wear robes with extra long tassels.","And they love to sit at the head table at banquets and in the seats of honor in the synagogues.","They love to receive respectful greetings as they walk in the marketplaces
 and to be called \u2018Rabbi.\u2019","\u201cDon\u2019t let anyone call you \u2018Rabbi
\u2019 for you have only one teacher
 and all of you are equal as brothers and sisters.","And don\u2019t address anyone here on earth as \u2018Father
\u2019 for only God in heaven is your Father.","And don\u2019t let anyone call you \u2018Teacher

 the Messiah.","The greatest among you must be a servant.","But those who exalt themselves will be humbled
 and those who humble themselves will be exalted.","\u201cWhat sorrow awaits you teachers of religious law and you Pharisees. Hypocrites! For you shut the door of the Kingdom of Heaven in people\u2019s faces. You won\u2019t go in yourselves
 and you don\u2019t let others enter either.","\u201cWhat sorrow awaits you teachers of religious law and you Pharisees. Hypocrites! For you cross land and sea to make one convert
 and then you turn that person into twice the child of hell you yourselves are!","\u201cBlind guides! What sorrow awaits you! For you say that it means nothing to swear \u2018by God\u2019s Temple
\u2019 but that it is binding to swear \u2018by the gold in the Temple.\u2019","Blind fools! Which is more important\u2014the gold or the Temple that makes the gold sacred?","And you say that to swear \u2018by the altar\u2019 is not binding
 but to swear \u2018by the gifts on the altar\u2019 is binding.","How blind! For which is more important\u2014the gift on the altar or the altar that makes the gift sacred?","When you swear \u2018by the altar
\u2019 you are swearing by it and by everything on it.","And when you swear \u2018by the Temple
\u2019 you are swearing by it and by God
 who lives in it.","And when you swear \u2018by heaven
\u2019 you are swearing by the throne of God and by God
 who sits on the throne.","\u201cWhat sorrow awaits you teachers of religious law and you Pharisees. Hypocrites! For you are careful to tithe even the tiniest income from your herb gardens
 but you ignore the more important aspects of the law\u2014justice
 mercy
 and faith. You should tithe
 yes
 but do not neglect the more important things.","Blind guides! You strain your water so you won\u2019t accidentally swallow a gnat
 but you swallow a camel!","\u201cWhat sorrow awaits you teachers of religious law and you Pharisees. Hypocrites! For you are so careful to clean the outside of the cup and the dish
 but inside you are filthy\u2014full of greed and self-indulgence!","You blind Pharisee! First wash the inside of the cup and the dish
 and then the outside will become clean
 too.","\u201cWhat sorrow awaits you teachers of religious law and you Pharisees. Hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs\u2014beautiful on the outside but filled on the inside with dead people\u2019s bones and all sorts of impurity.","Outwardly you look like righteous people
 but inwardly your hearts are filled with hypocrisy and lawlessness.","\u201cWhat sorrow awaits you teachers of religious law and you Pharisees. Hypocrites! For you build tombs for the prophets your ancestors killed
 and you decorate the monuments of the godly people your ancestors destroyed.","Then you say
 \u2018If we had lived in the days of our ancestors
 we would never have joined them in killing the prophets.\u2019","\u201cBut in saying that
 you testify against yourselves that you are indeed the descendants of those who murdered the prophets.","Go ahead and finish what your ancestors started.","Snakes! Sons of vipers! How will you escape the judgment of hell?","\u201cTherefore
 I am sending you prophets and wise men and teachers of religious law. But you will kill some by crucifixion
 and you will flog others with whips in your synagogues

 you will be held responsible for the murder of all godly people of all time\u2014from the murder of righteous Abel to the murder of Zechariah son of Berekiah
 whom you killed in the Temple between the sanctuary and the altar.","I tell you the truth
 this judgment will fall on this very generation.","\u201cO Jerusalem
 Jerusalem
 the city that kills the prophets and stones God\u2019s messengers! How often I have wanted to gather your children together as a hen protects her chicks beneath her wings

 look
 your house is abandoned and desolate.","For I tell you this

 and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in many parts of the world.","But all this is only the first of the birth pains
 with more to come.","\u201cThen you will be arrested
 persecuted
 and killed. You will be hated all over the world because you are my followers.","And many will turn away from me and betray and hate each other.","And many false prophets will appear and will deceive many people.","Sin will be rampant everywhere
 and the love of many will grow cold.","But the one who endures to the end will be saved.","And the Good News about the Kingdom will be preached throughout the whole world
 so that all nations will hear it; and then the end will come.","\u201cThe day is coming when you will see what Daniel the prophet spoke about\u2014the sacrilegious object that causes desecration standing in the Holy Place.\u201d (Reader
 pay attention!)","\u201cThen those in Judea must flee to the hills.","A person out on the deck of a roof must not go down into the house to pack.","A person out in the field must not return even to get a coat.","How terrible it will be for pregnant women and for nursing mothers in those days.","And pray that your flight will not be in winter or on the Sabbath.","For there will be greater anguish than at any time since the world began. And it will never be so great again.","In fact
 unless that time of calamity is shortened
 not a single person will survive. But it will be shortened for the sake of God\u2019s chosen ones.","\u201cThen if anyone tells you
 \u2018Look
 here is the Messiah
\u2019 or \u2018There he is
\u2019 don\u2019t believe it.","For false messiahs and false prophets will rise up and perform great signs and wonders so as to deceive
 if possible
 even God\u2019s chosen ones.","See
 I have warned you about this ahead of time.","\u201cSo if someone tells you
 \u2018Look
 the Messiah is out in the desert
\u2019 don\u2019t bother to go and look. Or
 \u2018Look
 he is hiding here
\u2019 don\u2019t believe it!","For as the lightning flashes in the east and shines to the west
 so it will be when the Son of Man comes.","Just as the gathering of vultures shows there is a carcass nearby
 so these signs indicate that the end is near.","\u201cImmediately after the anguish of those days
 the sun will be darkened
 the moon will give no light
 the stars will fall from the sky
 and the powers in the heavens will be shaken.","And then at last
 the sign that the Son of Man is coming will appear in the heavens
 and there will be deep mourning among all the peoples of the earth. And they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.","And he will send out his angels with the mighty blast of a trumpet
 and they will gather his chosen ones from all over the world\u2014from the farthest ends of the earth and heaven.","\u201cNow learn a lesson from the fig tree. When its branches bud and its leaves begin to sprout
 you know that summer is near.","In the same way
 when you see all these things
 you can know his return is very near
 right at the door.","I tell you the truth
 this generation will not pass from the scene until all these things take place.","Heaven and earth will disappear
 but my words will never disappear.","\u201cHowever
 no one knows the day or hour when these things will happen
 not even the angels in heaven or the Son himself. Only the Father knows.","\u201cWhen the Son of Man returns
 it will be like it was in Noah\u2019s day.","In those days before the flood
 the people were enjoying banquets and parties and weddings right up to the time Noah entered his boat.","People didn\u2019t realize what was going to happen until the flood came and swept them all away. That is the way it will be when the Son of Man comes.","\u201cTwo men will be working together in the field; one will be taken
 the other left.","Two women will be grinding flour at the mill; one will be taken
 the other left.","\u201cSo you
 too
 must keep watch! For you don\u2019t know what day your Lord is coming.","Understand this: If a homeowner knew exactly when a burglar was coming
 he would keep watch and not permit his house to be broken into.","You also must be ready all the time
 for the Son of Man will come when least expected.","\u201cA faithful
 sensible servant is one to whom the master can give the responsibility of managing his other household servants and feeding them.","If the master returns and finds that the servant has done a good job
 there will be a reward.","I tell you the truth
 the master will put that servant in charge of all he owns.","But what if the servant is evil and thinks
 \u2018My master won\u2019t be back for a while
\u2019","and he begins beating the other servants
 partying
 and getting drunk?","The master will return unannounced and unexpected
","and he will cut the servant to pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.","\u201cThen the Kingdom of Heaven will be like ten bridesmaids who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom.","Five of them were foolish
 and five were wise.","The five who were foolish didn\u2019t take enough olive oil for their lamps
","but the other five were wise enough to take along extra oil.","When the bridegroom was delayed
 they all became drowsy and fell asleep.","\u201cAt midnight they were roused by the shout
 \u2018Look
 the bridegroom is coming! Come out and meet him!\u2019","\u201cAll the bridesmaids got up and prepared their lamps.","Then the five foolish ones asked the others
 \u2018Please give us some of your oil because our lamps are going out.\u2019","\u201cBut the others replied
 \u2018We don\u2019t have enough for all of us. Go to a shop and buy some for yourselves.\u2019","\u201cBut while they were gone to buy oil
 the bridegroom came. Then those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast
 and the door was locked.","Later
 when the other five bridesmaids returned

 \u2018Believe me

 too
 must keep watch! For you do not know the day or hour of my return.","\u201cAgain
 the Kingdom of Heaven can be illustrated by the story of a man going on a long trip. He called together his servants and entrusted his money to them while he was gone.","He gave five bags of silver to one
 two bags of silver to another
 and one bag of silver to the last\u2014dividing it in proportion to their abilities. He then left on his trip.","\u201cThe servant who received the five bags of silver began to invest the money and earned five more.","The servant with two bags of silver also went to work and earned two more.","But the servant who received the one bag of silver dug a hole in the ground and hid the master\u2019s money.","\u201cAfter a long time their master returned from his trip and called them to give an account of how they had used his money.","The servant to whom he had entrusted the five bags of silver came forward with five more and said
 \u2018Master
 you gave me five bags of silver to invest
 and I have earned five more.\u2019","\u201cThe master was full of praise. \u2018Well done
 my good and faithful servant. You have been faithful in handling this small amount
 so now I will give you many more responsibilities. Let\u2019s celebrate together!\u2019","\u201cThe servant who had received the two bags of silver came forward and said
 \u2018Master
 you gave me two bags of silver to invest
 and I have earned two more.\u2019","\u201cThe master said
 \u2018Well done
 my good and faithful servant. You have been faithful in handling this small amount
 so now I will give you many more responsibilities. Let\u2019s celebrate together!\u2019","\u201cThen the servant with the one bag of silver came and said
 \u2018Master
 I knew you were a harsh man
 harvesting crops you didn\u2019t plant and gathering crops you didn\u2019t cultivate.","I was afraid I would lose your money
 so I hid it in the earth. Look
 here is your money back.\u2019","\u201cBut the master replied
 \u2018You wicked and lazy servant! If you knew I harvested crops I didn\u2019t plant and gathered crops I didn\u2019t cultivate
","why didn\u2019t you deposit my money in the bank? At least I could have gotten some interest on it.\u2019","\u201cThen he ordered
 \u2018Take the money from this servant
 and give it to the one with the ten bags of silver.","To those who use well what they are given
 even more will be given
 and they will have an abundance. But from those who do nothing
 even what little they have will be taken away.","Now throw this useless servant into outer darkness
 where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\u2019","\u201cBut when the Son of Man comes in his glory
 and all the angels with him
 then he will sit upon his glorious throne.","All the nations will be gathered in his presence
 and he will separate the people as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.","He will place the sheep at his right hand and the goats at his left.","\u201cThen the King will say to those on his right
 \u2018Come
 you who are blessed by my Father

 \u2018Away with you

 they dried up and died because they had no root. ","Some seeds fell among thorns. The thorns grew and did not give the seeds room to grow.","Some seeds fell on good ground and gave much grain. Some gave one hundred times as much grain. Some gave sixty times as much grain. Some gave thirty times as much grain.","You have ears
 then listen.\u201d","He said to the followers
 \u201cYou were given the secrets about the holy nation of heaven. The secrets were not given to the others. ","He who has will have more given to him. He will have even more than enough. But he who has little will have even that taken away from him.","\u201cThis is why I speak to them in picture-stories. They have eyes but they do not see. They have ears but they do not hear and they do not understand.","It happened in their lives as Isaiah said it would happen. He said
 \u2018You hear and hear but do not understand. You look and look but do not see. ","The hearts of these people have become fat. They hear very little with their ears. They have closed their eyes. If they did not do this
 they would see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their hearts. Then they would be changed in their ways
 and I would heal them.\u2019 (B)","But how great are your eyes because they see. How great are your ears because they hear.","For sure
 I tell you
 that many early preachers and men right with God have wanted to see the things you see
 but they did not see them. They wanted to hear the things you hear
 but they did not hear them.","\u201cListen to the picture-story of the man who planted seeds in the ground.","When anyone hears the Word about the holy nation and does not understand it
 the devil comes and takes away what was put in his heart. He is like the seed that fell by the side of the road. ","The seed which fell between rocks is like the person who receives the Word with joy as soon as he hears it.","Its root is not deep and it does not last long. When troubles and suffering come because of the Word
 he gives up and falls away. ","The seed which fell among thorns is like the person who hears the Word but the cares of this life
 and the love for money let the thorns come up and do not give the seed room to grow and give grain. ","The seed which fell on good ground is like the one who hears the Word and understands it. He gives much grain. Some seed gives one hundred times as much grain. Some gives sixty times as much grain. Some gives thirty times as much grain.\u201d","Jesus told them another picture-story. He said
 \u201cThe holy nation of heaven is like a man who planted good seed in his field. ","During the night someone who hated him came and planted weed seed with the good seed in his field and went away.","When the good seed started to grow and give grain
 weeds came up also.","\u201cThe servants of the man who planted the seed came and said to him
 \u2018Sir
 did you not plant good seed in your field? Why does it have weeds also?\u2019 ","The man who planted the seed said
 \u2018Someone who hates me has done this.\u2019 The servants asked him
 \u2018Should we go and pull the weeds out from among the good grain?\u2019 ","He said
 \u2018No
 because if you pull out the weeds
 the good grain will come up also. ","Let them grow together until the time to gather the grain. Then I will say to the workmen
 \u201cGather the weeds first and put them together to be burned. Then gather the good grain into my building.\u201d\u2019\u201d","Jesus told them another picture-story. He said
 \u201cThe holy nation of heaven is like mustard seed which a man planted in his field. ","It is the smallest of seeds. But when it is full-grown
 it is larger than the grain of the fields and it becomes a tree. The birds of the sky come and stay in its branches.\u201d","Jesus gave them another picture-story. He said
 \u201cThe holy nation of heaven is like yeast that a woman put into three pails of flour until it had become much more than at first.\u201d ","Jesus said
 \u201cHe Who plants the good seed is the Son of Man. ","The field is the world. The good seeds are the children of the holy nation. The weeds are the children of the devil.","The devil is the one who got in and planted the weeds. The time to gather is the end of the world. The men who gather are the angels.","As the weeds are gathered together and burned in the fire
 so will it be in the end of the world. ","The Son of Man will send His angels. They will gather out of His holy nation all things that cause people to sin and those who do sin.","They will put them into a stove of fire. There will be loud crying and grinding of teeth.","Then the ones right with God will shine as the sun in the holy nation of their Father. You have ears
 then listen!\u201d ","\u201cThe holy nation of heaven is like a box of riches buried in a field. A man found it and then hid it again. In his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.","\u201cAgain
 the holy nation of heaven is like a man who buys and sells. He is looking for good pearls. ","When he finds one good pearl worth much money
 he goes and sells all that he has and buys it.","\u201cThe holy nation of heaven is like a big net which was let down into the sea. It gathered fish of every kind.","When it was full
 they took it to the shore. They sat down and put the good fish into pails. They threw the bad fish away. ","It will be like this in the end of the world. Angels will come and take the sinful people from among those who are right with God.","They will put the sinful people into a stove of fire where there will be loud crying and grinding of teeth.\u201d","Jesus asked them
 \u201cHave you understood all these picture-stories?\u201d They said
 \u201cYes
 Lord!\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cEvery teacher of the Law who has become a follower of the holy nation of heaven is like a man who owns his house. He takes new and old riches from his house.\u201d","And they were ashamed of Him and turned away because of Him. Jesus said to them
 \u201cOne who speaks for God is shown no respect in his own town and in his own house.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cThey do not have to go away. Give them something to eat.\u201d ","Jesus said
 \u201cBring them to Me.\u201d ","At once Jesus spoke to them and said
 \u201cTake hope. It is I. Do not be afraid!\u201d ","Jesus said
 \u201cCome!\u201d Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water to Jesus. ","At once Jesus put out His hand and took hold of him. Jesus said to Peter
 \u201cYou have so little faith! Why did you doubt?\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cWhy do you break the Law of God by trying to keep their teaching? ","For God said
 \u2018Show respect to your father and mother.\u2019 (B) And
 \u2018He who curses his father or mother will be put to death.\u2019 (C) ","But you say that if a man says to his parents that anything he has
 that might have been of help to them
 is already given to God
 ","he does not have to show respect by helping his father and mother. You are putting aside the Word of God to keep their teaching.","You who pretend to be someone you are not
 Isaiah told about you. He said
 ","\u2019These people show respect to Me with their mouth
 but their heart is far from Me. ","Their worship of Me is worth nothing. They teach what men have made up.\u2019\u201d (D)","Jesus called the people to Him and said to them
 \u201cListen and understand this! ","It is not what goes into a man\u2019s mouth that makes his mind and heart sinful. It is what comes out of a man\u2019s mouth that makes him sinful.\u201d","He said
 \u201cEvery plant that My Father in heaven did not plant will be pulled up by the roots. ","Let them alone. They are blind leaders of the blind. If one blind man leads another blind man
 they will both fall into a hole.\u201d ","Jesus said
 \u201cDo you not understand yet? ","Do you not understand that whatever goes into the mouth goes into the stomach and then out of the body?","But whatever comes from the mouth has come out of the heart. These things make the man unclean inside.","For out of the heart come bad thoughts
 killing other people
 sex sins of a married person
 sex sins of a person not married
 stealing
 lying
 speaking against God. ","These are the things that make the man unclean inside. It does not make a man sinful to eat with hands that have not been washed.\u201d","He said
 \u201cI was sent only to the Jewish people who are lost.\u201d ","But He said
 \u201cIt is not right to take children\u2019s food and throw it to the dogs.\u201d ","Jesus said to her
 \u201cWoman
 you have much faith. You will have what you asked for.\u201d Her daughter was healed at that very time.","Then Jesus called His followers to Him. He said
 \u201cI pity these people because they have been with Me three days and they have no food. I do not want to send them home without food. They might get too weak as they go.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cHow many loaves of bread do you have?\u201d They said
 \u201cSeven loaves and a few small fish.\u201d ","(*He said to them

And how many baskets full were gathered up?","Or do you not even remember the seven loaves of bread that fed the four thousand men? And how many baskets full were gathered up?","Why is it that you do not see that I was not talking to you about bread? I was talking to you about keeping away from the yeast of the proud religious law-keepers and the religious group of people who believe no one will be raised from the dead.\u201d","Jesus came into the country of Caesarea Philippi.

 \u201cGet behind Me
 Satan! You are standing in My way. You are not thinking how God thinks. You are thinking how man thinks.\u201d","Jesus said to His followers
 \u201cIf anyone wants to be My follower
 he must forget about himself. He must take up his cross and follow Me. ","If anyone wants to keep his life safe
 he will lose it. If anyone gives up his life because of Me
 he will save it. ","For what does a man have if he gets all the world and loses his own soul? What can a man give to buy back his soul?","The Son of Man will come in the greatness of His Father with His angels. Then He will give to every man his pay as he has worked.","For sure
 I tell you
 there are some standing here that will not die until they see the Son of Man coming as King.\u201d","Jesus came and put His hand on them. He said
 \u201cGet up! Do not be afraid.\u201d ","As they came down from the mountain

 \u201cDo not tell anyone what you have seen until the Son of Man is raised from the dead.\u201d","He said
 \u201cFor sure
 Elijah will come first and get things ready. ","But I tell you
 Elijah has already come and they did not know him. They did to him whatever they wanted to do. In the same way the Son of Man will suffer from them also.\u201d ","Then Jesus said
 \u201cYou people of this day have no faith and you are going the wrong way. How long must I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring him here to Me.\u201d ","Jesus said to them

\u2019 and it would move over. You will be able to do anything. ","While they were still in Galilee
 Jesus said to the followers
 \u201cThe Son of Man will be handed over to men. ","They will kill Him
 but He will be raised from the dead three days later.\u201d The followers were very sad.","Peter said
 \u201cYes.\u201d When Peter came into the house

 \u201cFrom those of another country.\u201d Then Jesus said

But it is bad for the one who is the reason for someone to sin.","If your hand or your foot is the reason you sin
 cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to go into life without a hand or a foot
 than to have two hands or two feet and to be thrown into the fire of hell. ","If your eye is the reason you sin
 take it out and throw it away. It is better for you to go into life with one eye
 than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. ","Be sure you do not hate one of these little children. I tell you
 they have angels who are always looking into the face of My Father in heaven.","What do you think about this? A man has one hundred sheep and one of them is lost. Will he not leave the ninety-nine and go to the mountains to look for that one lost sheep?","If he finds it
 for sure
 I tell you
 he will have more joy over that one
 than over the ninety-nine that were not lost. ","I tell you
 My Father in heaven does not want one of these little children to be lost.","\u201cIf your brother sins against you
 go and tell him what he did without other people hearing it. If he listens to you
 you have won your brother back again. ","But if he will not listen to you
 take one or two other people with you. Every word may be remembered by the two or three who heard. ","If he will not listen to them
 tell the trouble to the church. If he does not listen to the church

 I tell you
 whatever you do not allow on earth will not have been allowed in heaven. Whatever you allow on earth will have been allowed in heaven. ","Again I tell you this: If two of you agree on earth about anything you pray for
 it will be done for you by My Father in heaven. ","For where two or three are gathered together in My name
 there I am with them.\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cI tell you
 not seven times but seventy times seven! ","\u201cThe holy nation of heaven is like a king who wanted to find out how much money his servants owed him.","As he began
 one of the servants was brought to him who owed him very much money. ","He could pay nothing that he owed. So the king spoke the word that he and his wife and his children and all that he had should be sold to pay what he owed.","The servant got down on his face in front of the king. He said
 \u2018Give me time

 \u2018Pay me the money you owe me!\u2019 ","The other servant got down at his feet and said
 \u2018Give me time
 and I will pay you all the money.\u2019 ","But he would not. He had him put in prison until he could pay the money.","\u201cWhen his other servants saw what had happened
 they were very sorry. They came and told the king all that was done. ","Then the king called for the first one. He said
 \u2018You bad servant! I forgave you. I said that you would not have to pay back any of the money you owed me because you asked me. ","Should you not have had pity on the other servant
 even as I had pity on you?\u2019 ","The king was very angry. He handed him over to men who would beat and hurt him until he paid all the money he owed.","So will My Father in heaven do to you
 if each one of you does not forgive his brother from his heart.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cHave you not read that He Who made them in the first place made them man and woman? ","It says
 \u2018For this reason a man will leave his father and his mother and will live with his wife. The two will become one.\u2019 ","So they are no longer two but one. Let no man divide what God has put together.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cBecause of your hard hearts Moses allowed you to divorce your wives. It was not like that from the beginning. ","And I say to you
 whoever divorces his wife
 except for sex sins
 and marries another
 is guilty of sex sins in marriage. Whoever marries her that is divorced is guilty of sex sins in marriage.\u201d","But Jesus said to them
 \u201cNot all men are able to do this
 but only those to whom it has been given. ","For there are some men who from birth will never be able to have children. There are some men who have been made so by men. There are some men who have had themselves made that way because of the holy nation of heaven. The one who is able to do this
 let him do it.\u201d","But Jesus said
 \u201cLet the little children come to Me. Do not stop them. The holy nation of heaven is made up of ones like these.\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cWhy are you asking Me about what is good? There is only One Who is good. If you want to have life that lasts forever
 you must obey the Laws.\u201d ","The man said to Him
 \u201cWhat kind of laws?\u201d Jesus said
 \u201cYou must not kill another person. You must not be guilty of sex sins. You must not steal. You must not lie. ","Show respect to your father and your mother. And love your neighbor as you love yourself.\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cIf you want to be perfect
 go and sell everything you have and give the money to poor people. Then you will have riches in heaven. Come and follow Me.\u201d ","Jesus said to His followers

 I tell you
 it will be hard for a rich man to get into the holy nation of heaven. ","Again I tell you
 it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to get into the holy nation of heaven.\u201d ","Jesus looked at them and said
 \u201cThis cannot be done by men. But with God all things can be done.\u201d","Jesus said to them

 I tell you
 when all the earth will be new and the Son of Man will sit on His throne in His shining-greatness
 you who have followed Me will also sit on twelve thrones

 will get a hundred times more. And you will get life that lasts forever. ","Many who are first will be last. Many who are last will be first.","\u201cFor the holy nation of heaven is like the owner of a grape-field.

 \u201cSee! My supper is ready. My cows and fat calves are killed. Everything is ready. Come to the wedding supper!\u201d\u2019 ","But they did not listen and went on working. One went to his farm. Another went to his store.","The others took hold of his servants
 and hurt them and killed them. ","\u201cWhen the king heard this
 he was very angry. He sent his soldiers to put those to death who had killed his servants. He burned their city. ","Then he said to his servants
 \u2018The wedding supper is ready. Those who were asked to come to the supper were not good enough. ","Go out into the roads and as many people as you can find
 ask them to come to the wedding supper.\u2019","\u201cThe servants went out into the roads and brought all they could find
 both bad and good. The wedding supper room was full of people. ","The king came in to see those who had come. He saw one man who did not have on wedding supper clothes.","He said to him
 \u2018Friend
 how did you get in here without wedding supper clothes?\u2019 The man could not speak! ","Then the king said to his servants
 \u2018Tie his hands and feet
 and throw him out into the darkness. In that place there will be loud crying and grinding of teeth.\u2019 ","For many are called but few are chosen.\u201d","Jesus knew their sinful thoughts and said
 \u201cYou pretend to be someone you are not! Why do you try to trap Me? ","Show Me a piece of money.\u201d They brought Him a piece.","Jesus said to them
 \u201cWhose picture is this? Whose name is on it?\u201d ","They said to Him
 \u201cCaesar\u2019s.\u201d Then He said to them
 \u201cPay to Caesar the things that belong to Caesar. Pay to God the things that belong to God.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cYou are wrong because you do not know the Holy Writings or the power of God. ","After people are raised from the dead
 they do not marry. They are like the angels in heaven. ","Have you not read what God said to you about those who are raised from the dead? He said
 ","\u2018I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.\u2019 He is not the God of the dead but of the living!\u201d (D)","Jesus said to him
 \u201c\u2018You must love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.\u2019 ","This is the first and greatest of the Laws.","The second is like it
 \u2018You must love your neighbor as you love yourself.\u2019 ","All the Laws and the writings of the early preachers depend on these two most important Laws.\u201d","\u201cWhat do you think about the Christ? Whose Son is He?\u201d They said to Him
 \u201cThe Son of David.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cThen how is it that David
 being led by the Holy Spirit
 calls Him \u2018Lord\u2019? He said
 ","\u2018The Lord said to my Lord

\u2019 then how can He be the Son of David?\u201d ","He said
 \u201cThe teachers of the Law and the proud religious law-keepers have put themselves in Moses\u2019 place as teachers. ","Do what they tell you to do and keep on doing it. But do not follow what they do. They preach but do not obey their own preaching.","They make heavy loads and put them on the shoulders of men. But they will not help lift them with a finger.","Everything they do
 they do to be seen of men. They have words from the Holy Writings written in large letters on their left arm and forehead and they make wide trimming for their clothes. ","They like to have the important places at big suppers and the best seats in the Jewish places of worship.","They like to have people show respect to them as they stand in the center of town where people gather. They like to be called teacher.","\u201cBut you are not to be called teacher. There is only one Teacher

There is only one Leader and He is Christ.","\u201cHe who is greatest among you will be the one to care for you.","The person who thinks he is important will find out how little he is worth. The person who is not trying to honor himself will be made important.","\u201cIt is bad for you

 and you do not allow those to go in who are about to go in. ","It is bad for you
 teachers of the Law and proud religious law-keepers
 you who pretend to be someone you are not! You go over land and sea to win one follower. When you have him
 you make him twice as much a child of hell as you are.","\u201cIt is bad for you
 blind leaders! You say

 his promise is worth nothing. But whoever makes a promise by the gold of the house of God

 the gold or the house of God that makes the gold holy? ","You say
 \u2018Whoever will promise by the altar
 his promise does not have to be kept. But whoever makes a promise by the gift on the altar
 then his promise has to be kept.\u2019 ","You fools and blind men! Which is greater
 the gift

 promises by it and by everything on it. ","Whoever makes a promise by the house of God

 you are showing that you are the sons of those who killed the early preachers. ","You might as well finish what your early fathers did.","You snakes! You family of snakes! How can you be kept from hell?","\u201cBecause of this
 I am going to keep on sending to you men who speak for God and wise men and teachers of the Law. Some of them you will kill and nail to a cross. Some of them you will beat in your places of worship. You will make it very hard for them as they go from city to city. ","Because of this
 you will be guilty of the blood of all those right with God on the earth. It will be from the blood of Abel who was right with God to the blood of Zachariah son of Barachias. He was the one you killed between the house of God and the altar. ","For sure
 I tell you
 all these things will come on the people of this day.","\u201cO Jerusalem

 I tell you
 the people of this day will not pass away before all these things have happened. ","\u201cHeaven and earth will pass away
 but My words will not pass away. ","But no one knows the day or the hour. No! Not even the angels in heaven know. The Son does not know. Only the Father knows.","\u201cWhen the Son of Man comes
 it will be the same as when Noah lived. ","In the days before the flood
 people were eating and drinking. They were marrying and being given in marriage. This kept on until the day Noah went into the large boat. ","They did not know what was happening until the flood came and the water carried them all away. It will be like this when the Son of Man comes.","\u201cTwo men will be working in a field. One will be taken and the other will be left.","Two women will be grinding grain. One will be taken and the other will be left.","\u201cBecause of this
 watch! You do not know on what day your Lord is coming. ","But understand this: If the owner of a house had known when the robber was coming

 he will make him boss over all that he has. ","But if that servant is bad
 he will think
 \u2018The owner will not come soon.\u2019 ","He will beat the others.

 \u2018Give us some of your oil because our lamps are going out.\u2019 ","But the wise women said
 \u2018No! There will not be enough for us and you. Go to the store and buy oil for yourselves.\u2019 ","While they were gone to buy oil
 the man soon to be married came. Those who were ready went in with him to the marriage. The door was shut. ","\u201cLater the foolish women came. They said

 I tell you

He called together the servants he owned and gave them his money to use.","He gave to one servant five pieces of money worth much. He gave to another servant two pieces of money worth much. He gave to another servant one piece of money worth much. He gave to each one as he was able to use it. Then he went on his trip.","The servant who had the five pieces of money went out to the stores and traded until he made five more pieces.","The servant who had two pieces of money did the same thing. He made two more pieces.","The servant who had received the one piece of money went and hid the money in a hole in the ground.

 \u2018You have done well. You are a good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a few things. I will put many things in your care. Come and share my joy.\u2019 ","The one who received two pieces of money worth much came also. He said
 \u2018Sir

 \u2018You bad and lazy servant. You knew that I gather grain where I have not planted. You knew that I take up where I have not spread out. ","You should have taken my money to the bank. When I came back
 I could have had my own money and what the bank paid for using it. ","Take the one piece of money from him. Give it to the one who has ten pieces of money.\u2019","For the man who has will have more given to him. He will have more than enough. The man who has nothing

 He will sit down on His throne of greatness. All the angels will be with Him. ","All the nations of the earth will be gathered before Him. He will divide them from each other as a shepherd divides the sheep from the goats.","He will put the sheep on His right side
 but the goats He will put on His left side. ","\u201cThen the King will say to those on His right side
 \u2018Come

 not what I want but what You want.\u201d ","Then He came to the followers and found them sleeping. He said to Peter
 \u201cWere you not able to watch with Me one hour? ","Watch and pray so that you will not be tempted. Man\u2019s spirit is willing

 for they shall obtain mercy.","Blessed are the pure in heart
 for they shall see God.","Blessed are the peacemakers

 and persecute you

 what can be salted with it? It is thereafter good for nothing but to be cast out and to be trodden underfoot by men.","You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid.","Neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel

 you cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven.","You have heard how it was said to the people of the old time
 You shall not kill. For whosoever kills will be liable to judgment. ","But I say to you
 whosoever is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment. Whosoever says to his brother
 Racha! will be liable to a council. But whosoever says
 You fool! will be liable to hell fire.","Therefore when you are offering your gift at the altar
 and there remember that your brother has anything against you

 you will not come out of there till you have paid the last penny.","You have heard how it was said to the people of the old time
 You shall not commit adultery. ","But I say to you that whosoever looks on a wife
 lusting after her
 has committed adultery with her already in his heart. ","Therefore if your right eye causes you to offend
 tear it out and cast it from you. It is better for you that one of your members perish than that your whole body should be cast into hell. ","Also
 if your right hand causes you to offend
 cut it off and cast it from you. Better it is that one of your members perish
 than that all your body should be cast into hell.","It is said
 Whosoever puts away his wife
 let him give her a testimonial also of the divorce. ","But I say to you
 whosoever puts away his wife (unless it be for fornication)
 causes her to break matrimony. And whoever marries her who is divorced
 breaks wedlock.","Again
 you have heard how it was said to the people of old time
 Do not forswear yourself
 but perform your oath to God. ","But I say to you
 do not swear at all \u2013 neither by heaven
 for it is God\u2019s seat
 ","nor yet by the earth
 for it his footstool
 nor by Jerusalem
 for it is the city of that great king. ","Neither should you swear by your head
 because you cannot make one hair white or black. ","But let your communication be yes
 yes
 and no
 no. For whatever is more than that
 comes of evil.","You have heard how it is said
 An eye for an eye
 a tooth for a tooth. ","But I say to you
 do not resist wrong. But whosoever gives you a blow on your right cheek
 turn to him the other. ","And if any man would sue you at law and take away your coat
 let him have your cloak also. ","And whoever would compel you to go a mile
 go with him two. ","Give to him who asks
 and from him who would borrow
 turn not away.","You have heard how it is said
 You shall love your neighbour and hate your enemy. ","But I say to you
 love your enemies. Bless those who curse you. Do good to those who hate you. Pray for those who do you wrong and persecute you
 ","so that you may be the children of your Father that is in heaven. For he makes his sun to arise on the evil and on the good
 and sends his rain on the just and the unjust. ","For if you love those who love you
 what reward should you have? Do not the publicans do the same? ","And if you are friendly to your brethren only
 what singular thing are you doing? Do not the publicans do likewise? ","You must therefore be perfect
 even as your Father who is in heaven is perfect.","Take heed to your alms
 that you do not give in the sight of men with the intent to be seen by them
 or you will receive no reward from your Father who is in heaven. ","Whenever therefore you give your alms
 do not make a trumpet to be blown before you
 as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets in order to be praised by men. Truly I say to you
 they have their reward. ","But when you give
 let not your left hand know what your right hand does
 ","so that your giving may be secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly.","And when you pray
 do not be as the hypocrites are. For they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets
 because they want to be seen by men. Truly I say to you
 they have their reward. ","But when you pray
 enter into your chamber and shut the door to
 and pray to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly.","And when you pray
 do not use vain repetitions like the heathen do. For they think that they will be heard for their many words. ","Be not like them therefore. For your Father knows what you need before you ask of him.","Pray therefore in this manner: O our Father who art in heaven
 Hallowed be thy name.","Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.","Give us this day our daily bread.","And forgive us our trespasses
 as we forgive them that trespass","And lead us not into temptation
 but deliver us from evil.","For if you forgive others their trespasses
 your heavenly Father will also forgive you. ","But if you will not forgive others their trespasses
 neither will your Father forgive you your trespasses.","Moreover
 when you fast
 do not be sad like the hypocrites are. For they disfigure their faces so they may be seen by men
 how they fast. Truly I say to you
 they have their reward. ","But you
 when you fast
 anoint your head and wash your face
 ","so that it does not appear to men that you are fasting
 but to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly.","See that you do not gather for yourselves treasure upon the earth
 where rust and moths destroy
 and where thieves break in and steal. ","But gather treasures together in heaven
 where neither rust nor moths destroy
 and where thieves do not break in or steal. ","For wherever your treasure is
 there will your hearts be also.","The light of the body is your eye. Therefore if your eye is single
 all your body will be full of light. ","But if your eye is bad
 then all your body will be full of darkness. Therefore if the light that is in you is darkness
 how great is that darkness!","No one can serve two masters. For either he will hate the one and love the other
 or else he will lean to the one and neglect the other. You cannot serve both God and mammon. ","Therefore I say to you
 do not be anxious about your life
 what you will eat or what you will drink
 nor yet for your body
 what you will put on. Is not life more than food
 and the body more than clothing? ","Behold the birds of the air. They do not sow or reap or gather into barns
 and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of much more value than they?","Which of you
 though he took thought for it
 could add one cubit to his stature? ","Why worry then about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field
 how they grow. They do not labour or spin. ","And yet for all that
 I say to you that even Solomon in all his royalty was not arrayed like one of these. ","Therefore if God so clothes the grass
 which is today in the field and tomorrow will be cast into the furnace
 will he not much more do the same for you
 O ye of little faith?","Therefore do not be anxious
 saying
 What will we eat? or
 What will we drink? or
 How will we be clothed? ","After all these things the Gentiles seek. For your heavenly Father knows that you have need of all these things.","But rather seek ye first the kingdom of heaven and its righteousness
 and all these things will be ministered unto you.","Care not then for the morrow
 but let the morrow care for itself. For the present day has ever enough of its own trouble.","Judge not
 that you be not judged. ","For as you judge
 so shall you be judged
 and the measure you use will be measured back to you. ","Why do you see a speck in your brother\u2019s eye
 and not perceive the beam that is in your own eye? ","Or why do you say to your brother
 Let me take the speck out of your eye
 and behold
 there is a beam in your own eye? ","Hypocrite
 first cast the beam out of your own eye
 and then you will see clearly to pluck the speck out of your brother\u2019s eye.","Do not give that which is holy to dogs
 nor cast your pearls before swine
 lest they tread them under their feet and then turn and tear you to shreds.","Ask
 and it will be given you. Seek
 and you will find. Knock
 and it will be opened to you. ","For whosoever asks
 receives; and he who seeks
 finds; and to him who knocks
 it will be opened. ","Is there anyone among you who
 if his son asked for bread
 would offer him a stone? ","Or if he asked for fish
 would give him a serpent? ","If then you who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children
 how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him?","Therefore whatever you would have others do unto you
 so do unto them. This is the law and the prophets.","Enter in at the strait gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction
 and many there are who go in at it. ","But strait is the gate and narrow is the way that leads to life
 and few there are who find it. ","Beware of false prophets
 who come to you in sheep\u2019s clothing
 but inwardly they are ravening wolves. ","You may know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes from thorns
 or figs from thistles? ","Likewise every good tree brings forth good fruit
 but a corrupt tree brings forth bad fruit. ","A good tree cannot bring forth bad fruit
 nor yet can a bad tree bring forth good fruit. ","Every tree that does not bring forth good fruit shall be hewn down and cast into the fire.","Therefore by their fruits you may know them.","Not all who say to me
 Lord
 Lord
 will enter into the kingdom of heaven
 but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. ","Many will say to me in that day
 Lord
 Lord
 have we not prophesied in your name
 and in your name have cast out devils
 and in your name done many miracles? ","And then I will declare to them that I never knew them. Depart from me
 ye workers of iniquity!","Whosoever hears these sayings of mine and does them
 I will liken him to a wise man who built his house on a rock. ","And much rain descended
 and the floods came
 and the winds blew and beat upon that same house; and it did not fall
 because it was grounded on the rock. ","And whosoever hears these sayings of mine and does them not shall be likened to a foolish man who built his house upon the sand.","And much rain descended
 and the floods came
 and the winds blew and beat upon that house
 and it fell. And great was the fall of it.","And Jesus put forth his hand and touched him
 saying
 I will; be clean! And immediately his leprosy was cleansed. ","And Jesus said to him
 See that you tell no one
 but go and show yourself to the priest
 and offer the gift that Moses commanded
 in witness to them.","And Jesus said to him
 I will come and heal him. ","When Jesus heard that
 he marvelled
 and said to the people who followed him
 Truly I say to you
 I have not found such great faith
 no
 not in Israel. ","I say therefore to you that many will come from the east and west
 and will rest with Abraham
 Isaac
 and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven
 ","but the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.","Then Jesus said to the centurion
 Go your way
 and as you believe
 so be it unto you. And his servant was healed that very same hour.","And Jesus said to him
 The foxes have holes
 and the birds of the air have nests
 but the Son of man has nowhere to rest his head. ","But Jesus said to him
 Follow me
 and let the dead bury their own dead.","And he said to them
 Why are you fearful
 O ye of little faith? Then he arose and rebuked the winds and the sea
 and there followed a great calm. ","And he said to them
 Go your ways. Then they went out and dispersed into the herd of swine. And behold
 the whole herd of swine was carried with violence headlong into the sea
 and perished in the water.","And lo
 they brought to him a paralyzed man lying in his bed. And when Jesus saw their faith he said to the paralytic
 Son
 be of good cheer; your sins are forgiven you. ","When Jesus saw their thoughts
 he said
 Why do you think evil in your hearts? ","Which is easier to say: Your sins are forgiven you
 or to say
 Arise and walk? ","But so that you may know that the Son of man has power to forgive sins in earth\u2013","And as Jesus passed onwards from there
 he saw a man named Matthew sitting at receipt of custom
 and said to him
 Follow me. And he arose and followed him.","When Jesus heard this
 he said to them
 The whole do not need the physician
 but they that are sick. ","Go and learn what this means: I have pleasure in mercy
 and not in offering. For I have not come to call the righteous
 but sinners
 to repentance.","And Jesus said to them
 Can the wedding children mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom shall be taken from them
 and then they will fast. ","No one patches an old garment with a piece of new cloth. For then the new piece pulls away from the garment
 and the tear is made greater. ","Neither do men put new wine into old wineskins
 for then the skins burst
 the wine runs out
 and the vessels are destroyed. But they pour new wine into new wineskins
 and so both are preserved together.","Then Jesus
 turning about and seeing her
 said
 Daughter
 be of good comfort; your faith has made you whole. And she was healed even that same hour.","he said to them
 All of you
 go away
 for the girl is not dead
 but sleeping. And they laughed him to scorn. ","And when he had gone indoors
 the blind men came to him. And Jesus said to them
 Do you believe that I am able to do this? And they said to him
 Yes
 Lord. ","And their eyes were opened. And Jesus charged them
 saying
 See that no one knows of this. ","Then he said to his disciples
 The harvest is great
 but the labourers are few. ","Therefore pray the Lord of the harvest to send forth labourers into his harvest.","These twelve Jesus sent out and charged
 saying
 Go not into the roads that lead to the Gentiles
 and do not enter into the towns of the Samaritans. ","But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.","Go and preach
 saying
 The kingdom of heaven is at hand! ","Heal the sick
 cleanse the lepers
 raise the dead
 cast out the devils. Freely you have received; freely give again.","Do not possess gold or silver or copper coins in your belts
 ","nor yet a bag for your journey; neither two coats
 nor shoes
 nor yet a staff. For the workman is worthy to have his keep. ","In whatever city or town you enter
 enquire who is worthy in it
 and there remain till you leave. ","And when you come into a household
 wish it well. ","And if the house is worthy
 your peace will come upon it. But if it is not worthy
 your peace will return to you again.","And whoever will not receive you
 nor will hear your preaching
 when you depart out of that house or that town
 shake off the dust from your feet. ","Truly I say to you
 it will be easier for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that place.","Behold
 I send you forth as sheep among wolves. Be therefore wise as serpents and innocent as doves. ","Beware of men
 for they will deliver you up to the councils
 and will scourge you in their synagogues. ","And you will be brought to the head governors and kings for my sake
 in witness to them and to the Gentiles.","But when they deliver you up
 do not be anxious about how or what you will speak
 for it will be given you even in that same hour what you should say. ","For it is not you who speak
 but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you.","Brother will betray brother to death
 and the father the son. And children will arise against their fathers and mothers
 and will put them to death. ","And you will be hated by all men for my name. But he who endures to the end shall be saved.","When they persecute you in one place
 flee into another. I tell you for a truth
 you will not finish all the cities of Israel before the Son of man comes.","The disciple is not above his teacher
 nor yet the servant above his lord. ","It is enough for the disciple to be as his teacher is
 and that the servant be as his lord is. If they have called the Lord of the house Beelzebub
 how much more will they call those of his household so? ","Fear them not therefore. There is nothing so closed that it will not be opened
 and nothing so hid that it will not be known.","What I tell you in darkness
 that speak in light. And what you hear in the ear
 that preach on the house tops. ","And fear not those who kill the body
 and are not able to kill the soul. But rather fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body into hell. ","Are not two sparrows sold for a copper coin? And yet none of them lights on the ground without your Father.","And now all the hairs of your heads are numbered.","Fear not therefore: you are of more value than many sparrows.","Whosoever therefore acknowledges me before men
 him will I acknowledge also before my Father who is in heaven. ","But whosoever denies me before men
 him will I also deny before my Father who is in heaven.","Think not that I have come to send peace into the earth. I came not to send peace
 but a sword. ","For I have come to set a man at variance against his father
 and the daughter against her mother
 and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. ","And a man\u2019s enemies will be those of his own household.","He who loves his father or mother more than me
 is not meet for me. And he who loves his son or daughter more than me
 is not meet for me. ","And he who does not take up his cross and follow me
 is not meet for me. ","He who finds his life will lose it
 and he who loses his life for my sake
 will find it.","He who receives you receives me
 and he who receives me
 receives him who sent me. ","He who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophet\u2019s reward. And he who receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man
 will receive the reward of a righteous man. ","And whosoever gives one of these little ones to drink a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple
 I tell you of a truth
 he shall not lose his reward.","Jesus answered and said to them
 Go and tell John what you have heard and seen: ","the blind see
 the lame walk
 the lepers are cleansed
 the deaf hear
 the dead rise up again
 and the glad tidings are preached to the poor. ","And blessed is the person who is not offended by me.","And as they departed
 Jesus began to speak to the people about John: What did you go out into the wilderness to see? Did you go to see a reed shaken with the wind? ","Or what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold
 they that wear soft clothing are in kings' houses. ","But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes
 I say to you
 and more than a prophet. ","For this is he of whom it is written: Behold
 I send my messenger before your face
 who shall prepare your way before you.","Truly I say to you
 among the children of women none greater than John the Baptist has arisen. Notwithstanding
 he who is less in the kingdom of heaven
 is greater than he.","From the time of John the Baptist to now
 the kingdom of heaven is sorely pressed
 and those who go to it with effort seize it for themselves. ","For all the prophets and the law prophesied with a view to the time of John.","And also
 if you will receive it
 this is Elijah who was to come. ","He who has ears to hear
 let him hear.","But to what can I liken this generation? It is like children who sit in the market and call to their fellows
 ","and say
 We have piped to you
 and you have not danced; we have mourned to you
 and you have not sorrowed. ","For John came neither eating nor drinking
 and they say he has the devil. ","The Son of man came eating and drinking
 and they say
 Here is a glutton and drinker of wine
 and a friend of publicans and sinners! Nevertheless
 wisdom is justified by her children.","Then Jesus began to upbraid the places in which most of his miracles had been done
 because they did not turn: ","Woe to you
 Chorazin! Woe to you
 Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were shown in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon
 they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. ","But I say to you
 it will be easier for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment than for you. ","And you Capernaum
 who are lifted up to heaven
 shall be brought down to hell. For if the miracles which have been done in you had been shown in Sodom
 it would have remained to this day. ","But I say to you
 it will be easier for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for you.","At that time Jesus concluded and said
 I praise you
 O Father
 Lord of heaven and earth
 because you have hid these things from the wise and learned
 and have revealed them to babes; ","Even so
 Father
 for so it pleased you.","All things are given to me by my Father. And no one knows the Son but the Father; nor does anyone know the Father except the Son
 and the person to whom the Son will reveal him.","Come unto me
 all ye that labour and are heavy-laden
 and I will give you rest. ","Take my yoke upon you
 and learn from me
 for I am gentle and lowly in heart
 and you will find rest for your souls. ","For my yoke is easy
 and my burden is light.","He said to them
 Have you not read what David did when he was hungry
 and those also who were with him? ","How he entered into the house of God and ate the hallowed loaves
 which were not lawful for him to eat
 neither for those who were with him
 but only for the priests? ","Or have you not read in the law how the priests in the temple break the Sabbath day
 and yet are blameless? ","But I say to you that there is one here greater than the temple.","So then if you had known what this means: I require mercy
 and not sacrifice \u2013 you would never have condemned the innocent. ","For the Son of man is Lord even of the Sabbath day.","And he said to them
 Which of you would it be
 if he had a sheep fallen into a pit on the Sabbath day
 that would not take it and lift it out? ","And of how much more value is a man than a sheep? Therefore it is lawful to do a good deed on the Sabbath days.","Then he said to the man
 Stretch forth your hand. And he stretched it forth. And it was made whole again like the other.","But Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them
 Every kingdom divided within itself will be brought to nothing. Neither can any city or household divided against itself continue. ","So if Satan casts out Satan
 then he is divided against himself. How then shall his kingdom endure? ","Also
 if I by the help of Beelzebub cast out devils
 by whose help do your children cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges. ","But if I cast out the devils by the Spirit of God
 then the kingdom of God has come upon you.","Or again
 how can a man enter into a strong man\u2019s house and forcibly take away his goods
 unless he first binds the strong man? And then he plunders his house. ","He who is not with me
 is against me
 and he who does not gather with me
 scatters abroad.","So I say to you
 all manner of sin and blasphemy may be forgiven men
 but the blasphemy of the Spirit will not be forgiven men. ","And whosoever speaks a word against the Son of man
 it may be forgiven him
 but whosoever speaks against the Holy Spirit
 it may not be forgiven him \u2013 no
 neither in this world
 nor in the world to come. ","Either judge the tree good
 and its fruit correspondingly good
 or else judge the tree evil
 and its fruit evil also. For the tree is known by its fruit.","O offspring of vipers
 how can you speak good things when you yourselves are evil? For out of the abundance of the heart
 the mouth speaks. ","A good man
 out of the good treasure of his heart
 brings forth good things. And an evil man
 out of his evil treasure
 brings forth evil things. ","But I say to you that for every idle word that men speak
 they will give account at the day of judgment. ","For by your words you will be justified
 and by your words you will be condemned.","He answered and said to them
 The evil and adulterous generation seeks a sign
 but there shall be no sign given to them except the sign of the prophet Jonah. ","For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the whale\u2019s belly
 so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. ","The people of Ninevah will rise at the day of judgment with this nation and condemn it
 for they reformed at the preaching of Jonah
 and behold
 one greater than Jonah is here. ","The queen of the south will rise at the day of judgment with this generation and will condemn them
 for she came from the furthermost parts of the world to hear the wisdom of Solomon
 and behold
 one greater than Solomon is here.","But when the unclean spirit has gone out of a man
 he walks throughout dry places
 seeking rest
 and finds none. ","Then he says
 I will return again into my house
 the one I came out of. And when he comes back
 he finds the house empty and swept and set in order. ","Then he goes his way and gets seven other spirits worse than himself
 and so they enter in and dwell there. And the end of that man is worse than the beginning. That is how it will be with this evil nation.","When Jesus was still speaking to the people
 his mother and his brethren stood outside
 desiring to speak with him. ","He answered and said to the one that had told him
 Who is my mother? or who are my brethren? ","And he stretched forth his hand over his disciples and said
 Behold my mother and my brethren. ","For whosoever does the will of my Father who is in heaven
 the same is my brother
 sister
 and mother.","And he spoke many things to them in similitudes
 saying
 Behold
 the sower went forth to sow. ","And as he sowed
 some seed fell by the wayside
 and the birds came and devoured it up. ","Some fell on stony ground where it had not much earth
 and it sprang up quickly
 because it had no depth of earth; ","and when the sun was up
 it caught heat
 and for lack of rooting withered away. ","Some fell among thorns
 and the thorns sprang up and choked it. ","But part fell in good ground
 and brought forth good fruit: some a hundredfold
 some sixtyfold
 some thirtyfold. ","Whosoever has ears to hear
 let him hear!","He answered and said to them
 It is given to you to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven
 but to them it is not given. ","For whosoever has
 to him will be given
 and he will have abundance. But whosoever has not
 from him shall be taken away even what he has. ","Therefore I speak to them in similitudes. For though they see
 they see not. And hearing
 they hear not
 neither understand. ","And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah
 which prophecy says: With the ears you will hear
 but will not understand
 and with the eyes you will see
 and will not perceive. ","For the hearts of this people have grown dull
 and their ears are hard of hearing
 and their eyes they have closed
 lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their hearts
 and should turn
 so that I might heal them.","But blessed are your eyes
 for they see
 and your ears
 for they hear. ","Truly I say to you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things that you see
 and have not seen them
 and to hear those things that you hear
 and have not heard them.","Hear therefore the similitude of the sower.","Whosoever hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it
 there comes the evil one
 and catches away that which was sown in his heart; and this is he who received the seed by the wayside. ","But he who received the seed in the stony ground is the person who hears the word of God
 and at once receives it with joy. ","Yet he has no roots in himself
 and therefore endures but a season
 for as soon as tribulation or persecution arises because of the word
 at once he falls. ","He who received the seed among thorns is the person who hears the word of God
 but the care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word
 and so he is made unfruitful. ","But he who receives the seed in good ground is the person who hears the word and understands it; who also bears fruit and brings forth
 some a hundredfold
 some sixtyfold
 and some thirtyfold.","Another similitude he put forth to them
 saying
 The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field. ","But while people were sleeping
 his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat
 and went his way. ","When the blade had sprung up and had brought forth fruit
 then the tares appeared also. ","Then the servants went to the householder and said to him
 Sir
 did you not sow good seed in your field? Where then did the tares come from? ","He said to them
 The envious man has done this. Then the servants said to him
 Do you want us then to go and weed them out? ","But he said
 Nay
 lest while you go about to weed out the tares
 you pluck up also with them the wheat by the roots. ","Let both grow together till harvest comes. And in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers
 Gather the tares first
 and bind them in sheaves to be burned; but gather the wheat into my barn.","Another parable he put forth to them
 saying
 The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed that a man takes and sows in his field
 ","which is the least of all seeds. But when it is grown
 it is the greatest among shrubs; and it is a tree
 so that the birds of the air come and build in its branches.","He told them another similitude: The kingdom of heaven is like leaven that a woman takes and hides in three measures of meal
 till all is leavened.","Then he answered and said to them
 He who sows the good seed is the Son of man. ","And the field is the world. And the children of the kingdom
 they are the good seed. And the tares are the children of the wicked one: ","the enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the world
 and the reapers are the angels. ","For even as the tares are gathered and burned in the fire
 so shall it be in the end of this world. ","The Son of man will send forth his angels
 and they will gather out of his kingdom all injurious things
 and those who do iniquity
 ","and will cast them into a furnace of fire. There shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.","Then shall the just shine as bright as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Whoever has ears to hear
 let him hear!","Again
 the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hid in a field
 which a person finds and hides
 and for the joy of it goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.","Again
 the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant who seeks good pearls
 ","who
 when he found one precious pearl
 went and sold all that he had and bought it.","Again
 the kingdom of heaven is like a net cast into the sea
 which gathers in all kinds of fishes. ","When it is full
 men draw it to land
 and sit and gather the good into vessels
 and cast the bad away. ","So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels will come out and separate the bad from the good
 ","and will cast them into a furnace of fire. There will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.","Jesus asked them
 Do you understand all these things? They said
 Yes
 Lord. ","Then he said to them
 Therefore every scribe who is instructed in the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings forth out of his treasure things both new and old.","And they were offended by him.","But Jesus said to them
 They have no need to go away; you give them to eat. ","And he said
 Bring them here.","And straightaway Jesus spoke to them
 saying
 Be of good cheer
 it is I. Be not afraid. ","And he said
 Come! And when Peter had gone down out of the boat
 he walked on the water to go to Jesus.","And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him
 and said to him
 O you of little faith
 why did you doubt? ","He answered and said to them
 And why do you transgress the commandment of God through your precepts? ","For God commanded
 saying
 Honour your father and mother
 and
 He who curses father or mother shall suffer death. ","But you say every man should tell his father or mother
 That which you desire of me
 to help you with
 is given for God \u2013 ","and so he should not honour his father or mother. And thus you have made the commandment of God to be without effect
 through your precepts. ","Hypocrites
 well did Isaiah prophesy of you
 saying
 ","This people draws near to me with their mouths
 and honours me with their lips
 but their hearts are far from me. ","And in vain they worship me
 teaching doctrines which are nothing but men\u2019s precepts.\u00a0","And he called the people to him and said to them
 Hear and understand: ","that which goes into the mouth does not defile a man
 but that which comes out of the mouth defiles a man.","He answered and said
 All plants that my heavenly Father has not planted shall be plucked up by the roots. ","Let them alone. They are the blind leaders of the blind. If the blind lead the blind
 both will fall into the ditch.","Jesus said
 Are you still without understanding? ","Do you not see that whatever goes in at the mouth descends down into the stomach
 and is cast out into the drain? ","But those things which proceed out of the mouth come from the heart
 and they defile the person. ","For out of the heart come evil thoughts
 murder
 breaking of wedlock
 whoredom
 theft
 bearing of false witness
 slander. ","These are the things that defile a person. But to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a person.","He answered and said
 I am not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.","He answered and said
 It is not good to take the children\u2019s bread and to cast it to dogs. ","Then Jesus answered and said to her
 O woman
 great is your faith! Let it be unto you even as you desire.","Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said
 I have compassion on the people
 because they have continued with me now for three days
 and have nothing to eat. I do not want to let them go away without eating
 lest they faint along the road. ","And Jesus said to them
 How many loaves do you have? And they said
 Seven
 and a few little fishes.","He answered and said to them
 At evening you say the weather will be fair
 and that because the sky is red; ","and in the morning you say it will be bad weather today
 and that because the sky is cloudy and red. O ye hypocrites
 you can discern the aspect of the sky
 and can you not discern the signs of the times? ","The froward and adulterous nation seeks a sign
 but no other sign shall be given to them than the sign of the prophet Jonah.","Then Jesus said to them
 Take heed
 and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees. ","When Jesus understood this
 he said to them
 O ye of little faith
 why are your minds cumbered because you have brought no bread? ","Do you not yet perceive? Nor remember those five loaves when there were 5
000 men
 and how many baskets you took up? ","Nor the seven loaves when there were 4
000
 and how many baskets you took up? ","Why do you not perceive then that I was not speaking to you about bread when I said to beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?","When Jesus arrived in the vicinity of the city which is called Caesarea Phillippi
 he asked his disciples
 saying
 Who do men say that I
 the Son of man
 am? ","He said to them
 But who do you say that I am? ","And Jesus answered and said to him
 Blessed are you
 Simon son of Jonah
 for flesh and blood has not revealed that to you
 but my Father who is in heaven. ","And I say also to you that you are Peter
 and upon this rock I will build my congregation. And the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. ","And I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of heaven: whatever you bind upon earth shall be bound in heaven
 and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.","Then Jesus turned about and said to Peter
 Get behind me
 Satan! You offend me
 because you savour not the things of God
 but things of the world.","Jesus then said to his disciples
 If any person would follow me
 let him deny himself
 and take up his cross and follow me. ","For whosoever would save his life
 will lose it. And whosoever loses his life for my sake
 will find it. ","What will it profit a man
 though he should win all the whole world
 if he loses his own soul? Or
 what can a man give to redeem his soul? ","For the Son of man will come in the glory of his Father with his angels
 and then shall he reward every person according to his deeds.","Truly I say to you
 some there are among them that stand here who shall not taste of death till they have seen the Son of man come in his kingdom.","And Jesus came and touched them and said
 Arise
 and do not be afraid. ","And as they came down from the mountain
 Jesus charged them
 saying
 See that you tell no one about the vision until the Son of man is risen up again from death. ","Jesus answered and said to them
 Elijah does come first
 and restore all things. ","And I say to you that Elijah has come already
 and they did not know him
 but have done to him whatever they pleased. In like manner will the Son of man also suffer at their hands. ","Jesus answered and said
 O generation faithless and perverse
 how long shall I be with you? How long shall I suffer you? Bring him here to me.","Jesus said to them
 Because of your unbelief. For I say truly to you
 if you had faith like a grain of mustard seed
 you could say to this mountain
 Move over there
 and it would move; neither should anything be impossible for you to do. ","As they passed the time in Galilee
 Jesus said to them
 The Son of man will be betrayed into the hands of men
 ","and they will kill him; and the third day he will rise again. And they sorrowed greatly.","He said
 Yes. And when he had come into the house
 Jesus spoke first to him
 saying
 What do you think
 Simon: from whom do the kings of the earth take tribute or poll money? From their children
 or from others? ","Peter answered
 From others. And Jesus said to him
 Then the children are free. ","Nevertheless
 lest we offend them
 go to the sea and cast in your hook
 and take the fish that first comes up. And when you have opened its mouth
 you will find a coin. Take it
 and pay for me and you.","and said
 Truly I say to you
 unless you turn and become as children
 you cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven. ","Whoever therefore humbles himself like this child
 the same is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. ","And whoever receives such a child in my name
 receives me. ","But whoever hurts one of these little ones who believe in me
 it would be better for him if a millstone were hung about his neck and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea. ","Woe be to the world because of offences. However
 it cannot be avoided but that offences will come. Nevertheless
 woe be to the man by whom the offence comes.","And so if your hand or your foot causes you to offend
 cut it off and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life lame or maimed than for you
 having two hands or two feet
 to be cast into everlasting fire. ","And if also your eye causes you to offend
 tear it out and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life with one eye than
 having two eyes
 to be cast into hell fire.","See that you do not despise one of these little ones. For I say to you that in heaven their angels always behold the face of my Father who is in heaven.","What do you think: if a man has a hundred sheep and one of them has gone astray
 does he not leave the ninety-nine in the mountains and go and seek that one which has gone astray? ","If it happens that he finds it
 truly I say to you
 he rejoices more over that sheep than over the ninety-nine that did not go astray. ","In the same way
 it is not the will of your Father in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.","Moreover
 if your brother trespasses against you
 go and tell him his fault between him and you alone. If he hears you
 you have redeemed your brother. ","But if he does not hear you
 then take along with you one or two others
 so that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every matter may be established. ","If he does not hear them
 tell it to the congregation. If he does not hear the congregation
 take him as a heathen man and as a publican. ","Truly I say to you
 whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven
 and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.","Again I say to you
 if two of you agree in earth about any manner of thing
 whatsoever they desire
 it shall be given them by my Father who is in heaven. ","For where two or three are gathered together in my name
 there am I in the midst of them.","Jesus said to him
 I say to you
 not seven times
 but seventy times seven times. ","Therefore the kingdom of heaven is likened to a certain king who wished to take accounts from his servants.","And when he had begun the reckoning
 one was brought to him who owed him 10
000 talents. ","Because he had nothing to pay with
 his master ordered him to be sold
 and his wife and his children and all that he had
 and payment to be made. ","The servant fell down and besought him
 saying
 Sir
 give me respite
 and I will pay it every whit. ","Then the lord had pity on that servant
 and released him
 and forgave him the debt.","And that same servant went out and found one of his fellows who owed him 100 denarii
 and laid hands on him and took him by the throat
 saying
 Pay me what you owe! ","And his fellow servant fell down and besought him
 saying
 Have patience with me
 and I will pay you everything. ","But he would not
 and went and cast him into prison till he should pay the debt.","When the other servants saw what had been done
 they were very grieved
 and went and told their lord all that had happened. ","Then his lord called the man and said to him
 O evil servant! I forgave you all that debt because you begged me. ","Was it not right also that you should have had compassion on your fellow
 just as I had pity on you? ","And his lord was angry
 and delivered him to the jailers till he should pay all that was due to him. ","So likewise shall my heavenly Father do with you
 unless you forgive with your hearts each one his brother\u2019s trespasses.","He answered and said to them
 Have you not read how it was that he who made man at the beginning made them man and woman
 ","and said
 For this thing shall a man leave father and mother and cleave unto his wife
 and the two shall be one flesh? ","So then
 now they are not two
 but one flesh. Let not man therefore put apart that which God has joined together.","He said to them
 Moses
 because of the hardness of your hearts
 suffered you to put away your wives. But from the beginning it was not so. ","I say therefore to you
 whoever puts away his wife (unless it be for fornication) and marries another
 breaks wedlock. And whoever marries her who is divorced
 commits adultery.","He said to them
 Not everyone can receive this saying
 but only those to whom it is given. ","Some are chaste who were so born from their mother\u2019s womb. And others are chaste who were made so by men. And others are chaste who have made themselves chaste for the kingdom of heaven\u2019s sake. He who can receive it
 let him receive it.","But Jesus said
 Allow the children
 and do not forbid them to come to me
 for of such is the kingdom of heaven. ","He said to him
 Why do you call me good? There is none good but one
 and that is God. But if you would enter into life
 keep the commandments. ","The other asked him
 Which? And Jesus said
 Break no wedlock. Do not kill. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness. ","Honour father and mother. And love your neighbour as yourself.","And Jesus said to him
 If you would be perfect
 go and sell what you have
 and give it to the poor
 and you will have treasure in heaven; and come
 and follow me.","Then Jesus said to his disciples
 Truly I say to you
 it is hard for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven. ","And moreover I say to you
 it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.","Jesus regarded them and said to them
 With men it is not possible
 but with God all things are possible.","Jesus said to them
 Truly I say to you
 when the Son of man sits in the seat of his majesty
 you who have followed me in the new birth shall sit also upon twelve seats and judge the twelve tribes of Israel. ","And whosoever gives up houses
 or brethren
 or sisters
 or father
 or mother
 or wife
 or children
 or lands for my name\u2019s sake
 the same shall receive a hundredfold
 and shall inherit everlasting life. ","Many that are first shall be last
 and the last shall be first.","For the kingdom of heaven may be likened to a householder who went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard.","And he agreed with the labourers for a denarius a day
 and sent them into his vineyard. ","And he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the market place
 ","and said to them
 Go ye also into my vineyard
 and whatever is right
 I will give you. And they went their way.","Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour
 and did likewise. ","And he went out about the eleventh hour and found others standing idle
 and said to them
 Why do you stand here idle all the day? ","They said to him
 Because no one has hired us. He said to them
 Go ye also into my vineyard
 and whatever is right
 that you will receive.","When evening was come
 the lord of the vineyard said to his steward
 Call the labourers and give them their wages
 beginning at the last till you come to the first.","And those who were hired about the eleventh hour came and received every man a denarius.","Then came the first
 supposing that they would receive more
 but they likewise received every man a denarius. ","And when they had received it
 they murmured against the master of the house
 ","saying
 These last have worked only one hour
 and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden and heat of the day.","He answered to one of them
 saying
 Friend
 I do you no wrong. Did you not agree with me for a denarius? ","Take that which is your due
 and go your way. I want to give to the last one as much as to you. ","Is it not lawful for me to do as I please with what belongs to me? Is your eye evil because I am good?","In like manner the last may be first
 and the first last. For many are called
 but few are chosen.","Behold
 we are going up to Jerusalem. And the Son of man will be betrayed to the chief priests and to the scribes
 and they will condemn him to death
 ","and will deliver him to the Gentiles to be mocked
 to be scourged
 and to be crucified; and the third day he will rise again.","He said to her
 What would you like? She answered him
 Grant that these my two sons may sit
 the one on your right hand and the other on your left hand
 in your kingdom.","Jesus answered and said
 You know not what you ask. Are you able to drink of the cup that I must drink of
 and to be baptized with the baptism that I must be baptized with?","But Jesus called them to him and said
 You know that the lords of the Gentiles have dominion over them
 and those who are great exercise power over them. ","It shall not be this way among you
 but whosoever would be great among you
 let him minister to you
 ","and whoever would be chief
 let him be your servant \u2013 ","even as the Son of man came not to be served
 but to serve
 and to give his life for the redemption of many.","Then Jesus stood still and called them
 and said
 What do you want me to do for you? ","saying to them
 Go into the town that lies in front of you
 and immediately you will find a donkey tied
 and her colt with her. Untie them and bring them to me. ","And if anyone says anything to you
 say that the Lord has need of them
 and straightaway he will let them go.","and said to them
 It is written: My house shall be called the house of prayer. But you have made it a den of thieves.","and said to him
 Do you hear what they say? Jesus said to them
 Yea
 have you never read: From the mouth of babes and sucklings
 you have ordained praise?","and saw a fig tree by the road
 and went to it
 and found nothing on it but leaves only
 and said to it
 Let fruit never grow on you from this time forward. And at once the fig tree withered away. ","Jesus answered and said to them
 Truly I say to you
 if you have faith and do not doubt
 you will not only do what I have done to the fig tree
 but also if you say to this mountain
 Take yourself away and cast yourself into the sea
 it will be done. ","And whatever you ask in prayer (if you believe)
 you will receive it.","Jesus answered and said to them
 I also will ask of you a certain question
 which
 if you answer me
 I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things. ","The baptism of John: whence was it? from heaven
 or of men?","And they answered Jesus and said
 We don\u2019t know.","What do you say to this: A certain man had two sons
 and went to the elder and said
 Son
 go and work today in my vineyard. ","He answered and said
 I will not
 but afterward he repented and went. ","Then the father went to the second son and said likewise. And he answered and said
 I will
 Sir. Yet he did not go. ","Which of the two did the will of the father?","For John came to you in the way of righteousness
 and you did not believe him. But the publicans and the harlots believed him. And yet you
 though you saw it
 were still not moved with repentance
 so that you might afterward have believed him.","Hear another similitude: There was a certain householder
 who planted a vineyard. He hedged it round about
 and made a winepress in it
 and built a tower
 and let it out to husbandmen
 and went into a far country. ","And when the time of the fruit drew near
 he sent his servants to the husbandmen
 to receive the fruits of it. ","And the husbandmen caught his servants
 and beat one
 killed another
 and stoned another. ","Again he sent other servants
 more than at the first
 and they treated them likewise. ","Then last of all he sent to them his own son
 saying
 They will respect my son. ","But when the husbandmen saw the son
 they said among themselves
 This is the heir; come
 let us kill him
 and let us take his inheritance for ourselves. ","And they caught him and thrust him out of the vineyard
 and slew him. ","Now when the lord of the vineyard comes
 what will he do with those husbandmen?","They said to him
 He will miserably destroy those evil persons
 and will let out his vineyard to other husbandmen
 who will render to him the fruit in their seasons.","Jesus said to them
 Did you never read in the scriptures: The stone which the builders refused
 the same is set in the principal part of the corner; this was the Lord\u2019s doing
 and it is marvellous in our eyes? ","Therefore I say to you
 the kingdom of God will be taken from you and will be given to the Gentiles
 who will bring forth the fruits of it. ","And whosoever falls on this stone
 he shall be broken; but whomever it falls upon
 it will grind him to powder.","The kingdom of heaven is like a certain king who arranged a marriage for his son
 ","and sent forth his servants to call those who were bid to the wedding
 and they would not come. ","Again he sent forth other servants
 saying
 Tell those who are bidden
 Behold
 I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and my fatted calves are killed
 and all things are ready. Come to the marriage.","But they made light of it and went their ways
 one to his farmstead
 another about his wares. ","The rest took his servants and shamefully abused them
 and slew them.","When the king heard about this
 he was furious
 and sent forth his warriors
 and destroyed those murderers
 and burnt up their city. ","Then said the king to his servants
 The wedding was prepared
 but those who were bidden were not worthy. ","Go therefore out into the highways
 and as many as you find
 bid them to the marriage.","The servants went out into the highways and gathered together as many as they could find
 both good and bad
 and the wedding was furnished with guests. ","Then the king came in to visit the guests
 and spotted there a man who did not have on a wedding garment
 ","and said to him
 Friend
 how did it happen that you came in here and do not have on a wedding garment? And the man was quite speechless. ","Then said the king to his servants
 Take and bind him hand and foot
 and cast him into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. ","For many are called
 but few are chosen.","Jesus perceived their wickedness and said
 Why do you bait me
 you hypocrites? ","Let me see the tribute coin. So they brought him a denarius.","And he said to them
 Whose image and superscription is this? ","They said to him
 Caesar\u2019s. Then he said to them
 Give therefore to Caesar that which is Caesar\u2019s
 and give to God that which is God\u2019s.","Jesus answered and said to them
 You are deceived
 and do not understand the scriptures
 nor yet the power of God. ","For in the resurrection people neither marry nor are married
 but are as the angels in heaven. ","As for the resurrection of the dead
 have you not read what is spoken to you by God
 who says
 ","I am Abraham\u2019s God
 and Isaac\u2019s God
 and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead
 but of the living.","Jesus said to him
 Love the Lord your God with all your heart
 with all your soul
 and with all your mind; ","this is the first and the chief commandment.","And there is another like this: Love your neighbour as yourself.","On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.","saying
 What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he? They said to him
 The son of David. ","He said to them
 How then does David in the Spirit call him Lord
 saying
 ","The Lord said to my Lord
 Sit on my right hand
 till I make your enemies your footstool? ","If David calls him Lord
 how is he then his son?","saying
 The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses\u2019 seat. ","All therefore that they bid you to observe
 that observe and do. But do not follow their works. For they say
 but do not do. ","Yea and they bind up heavy burdens
 grievous to be borne
 and lay them on men\u2019s shoulders
 but they will not lift a finger to carry them themselves.","All their works they do to be seen by men. They enlarge their phylacteries
 and make large borders on their garments. ","They love to sit uppermost at feasts
 and to have the chief seats in the synagogues
 ","and greetings in the markets
 and to be called Rabbi by men.","But you shall not suffer yourselves to be called Rabbi. For one is your Master
 that is
 Christ
 and you are all brethren. ","And call no man upon the earth your father
 for there is but one your Father
 and he is in heaven. ","Do not be called teachers
 for there is but one your Teacher
 and he is Christ. ","He who is greatest among you will be your servant.","But whosoever exalts himself
 shall be brought low. And he who humbles himself
 shall be exalted.","Woe is to you scribes and Pharisees
 hypocrites! For you shut up the kingdom of heaven before men. You yourselves go not in
 neither do you suffer those who come to enter in.","Woe to you
 scribes and Pharisees
 hypocrites
 who compass land and sea to bring one person into your belief. And when he is brought in
 you make him twofold more the child of hell than you yourselves are.","Woe to you
 blind guides
 who say that if someone swears by the temple
 it is nothing
 but whosoever swears by the gold of the temple
 he offends. ","O fools
 and blind! Which is greater: the gold
 or the temple that sanctifies the gold? ","And whosoever swears by the altar
 it is nothing
 but whoever swears by the offering that lies on the altar
 offends \u2013 ","Ye fools
 and blind! Which is greater: the offering
 or the altar that sanctifies the offering? ","Whoever therefore swears by the altar
 swears by it and by all that is on it. ","And whoever swears by the temple
 swears by it and by him who dwells therein. ","And he who swears by heaven
 swears by the seat of God and by him who sits upon it.","Woe to you
 scribes and Pharisees
 hypocrites
 who tithe mint
 anise
 and cummin
 and leave the weightier matters of the law undone: judgment
 mercy
 and faith. These you ought to have done
 and not to have left the others undone. ","Blind guides
 who strain out a gnat and swallow a camel!","Woe to you
 scribes and Pharisees
 hypocrites
 who make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter
 but within they are full of greed and excess. ","You blind Pharisee: cleanse first the inside of the cup and platter
 so that the outside of them may be clean also.","Woe to you
 scribes and Pharisees
 hypocrites! For you are like painted tombs
 which appear beautiful outwardly
 but within are full of dead bones and of all uncleanness. ","This is how you are
 for outwardly you appear righteous to men
 when within you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.","Woe to you
 scribes and Pharisees
 hypocrites! You build the tombs of the prophets
 and adorn the sepulchres of the righteous
 ","and say
 If we had been in the days of our fathers
 we would not have been partners with them in the blood of the prophets. ","So then
 you are witnesses against yourselves
 that you are the children of those who killed the prophets! ","Fill up then likewise the cup of your fathers.","Serpents and offspring of vipers
 how can you escape the judgment of hell?","And so behold: I send to you prophets
 wise men
 and scribes. Some of them you will kill and crucify
 and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues and persecute from city to city
 ","so that upon you may come all the righteous blood that was shed upon the earth
 from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah
 the son of Berechiah
 whom you slew between the temple and the altar. ","Truly I say to you
 all these things will come upon this generation.","O Jerusalem
 Jerusalem
 who kills prophets
 and stones those who are sent to you! How often would I have gathered your children together
 as the hen gathers her chicks under her wings. But you would not. ","Behold
 your habitation shall be left to you desolate. ","For I say to you
 you will not see me henceforth until you say
 Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.","Jesus said to them
 Do you not see all these things? Truly I say to you
 there shall not be left here one stone upon another that will not be cast down.","And Jesus answered and said to them
 Take heed that no one deceives you. ","For many will come in my name saying
 I am Christ! and will deceive many. ","You will hear of wars and of the infamy of wars. But see that you be not troubled. For all these things must come to pass
 but the end is not yet. ","For nation will rise against nation
 and realm against realm. And there will be pestilence
 hunger
 and earthquakes in all quarters. ","All these are the beginning of sorrows.","Then they will put you to tribulation
 and will kill you
 and you will be hated by all nations for my name\u2019s sake. ","And then shall many fall into offence
 and will betray one another
 and will hate one another. ","And many false prophets will arise
 and will deceive many. ","And because iniquity will have the upper hand
 the love of many will abate.","But he who endures to the end
 the same will be saved. ","And this glad tidings of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world
 for a witness to all nations; and then shall the end come.","When you therefore see the abomination that betokens desolation spoken of by Daniel the prophet stand in the holy place
 let him who reads it
 understand it. ","Then let those who are in Judea flee into the mountains.","And let him who is on the housetop not come down to fetch anything out of his house.","Neither let him who is in the field return back to fetch his clothes.","Woe shall be in those days to women that are with child
 and to those who give suck. ","But pray that your flight be not in the winter
 neither on the Sabbath day. ","For then will be great tribulation
 such as was not from the beginning of the world to this time
 nor will be. ","Yea and unless those days were shortened
 no flesh would be saved. But for the sake of the chosen
 those days will be shortened.","Then if any one says to you
 See
 here is Christ! or there is Christ! \u2013 believe it not. ","For false christs and false prophets will arise
 and will do great miracles and wonders
 insomuch that if it were possible
 the very elect should be deceived. ","Take heed
 I have told you beforehand. ","So if they say to you
 Behold
 he is in the desert! go not forth; or
 Behold
 he is in the secret places! believe it not. ","For as the lightning comes out of the east and shines to the west
 so will the coming of the Son of man be. ","For wherever the dead body is
 there will the eagles resort.","Immediately after the tribulations of those days
 the sun will be darkened
 and the moon will not give her light
 and the stars will fall from heaven
 and the powers of heaven shall move. ","And then will appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven. And then shall all the kindreds of the earth mourn
 and they shall see the Son of man come in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. ","And he will send his angels with the great voice of a trumpet
 and they will gather together his chosen from the four winds
 and from the one end of the world to the other.","Learn from a similitude of the fig tree: when its branches are yet tender and its leaves sprung
 you know that summer is near. ","So likewise you
 when you see all these things
 may be sure that it is near
 even at the doors. ","Truly I say to you that this generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled.","Heaven and earth shall perish
 but my words will abide. ","But of that day and hour no man knows \u2013 no
 not the angels of heaven
 but my Father only. ","As the time of Noah was
 so likewise will the coming of the Son of man be. ","For as in the days before the flood they were eating and drinking
 marrying and were married
 right up to the day that Noah entered into the ship
 ","and knew of nothing till the flood came and took them all away
 so also will the coming of the Son of man be. ","Then two will be in the fields; the one will be received
 and the other will be refused. ","Two will be grinding at the mill; the one will be received
 and the other will be refused.","Watch therefore
 because you do not know what hour your master will come. ","Of this be sure: if the householder knew what hour the thief would come
 he would surely watch
 and not allow his house to be broken into. ","Therefore you also be ready
 because in the hour you think he would not
 the Son of man will come.","If there be any servant faithful and wise
 whom his master has appointed over his household
 to give them food in due season
 ","happy is that servant whom his master (when he comes) finds so doing.","Truly I say to you
 he will appoint him over all his goods. ","But if the evil servant says in his heart
 My master will defer his coming
 ","and begins to smite his fellow servants
 yea and to eat and to drink with the drunken
 ","the servant\u2019s master will come in a day when he is not expecting him
 and in an hour that he is not aware of
 ","and will separate him
 and give him his reward with the hypocrites. And there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.","Then the kingdom of heaven will be likened to ten virgins who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom.","Five of them were foolish
 and five were wise. ","The foolish took their lamps
 but took no oil with them. ","But the wise took oil with them in their vessels
 with their lamps also.","While the bridegroom tarried
 all slumbered and slept. ","And right at midnight there was a cry made: Behold
 the bridegroom comes! Go out to meet him! ","Then all those virgins arose and prepared their lamps.","And the foolish said to the wise
 Give us some of your oil
 for our lamps are going out. ","But the wise answered
 saying
 Not so
 lest there not be enough for us and you; but go rather to those who sell
 and buy for yourselves.","And while they were going to buy
 the bridegroom came. And those who were ready went in with him to the wedding
 and the gate was shut up. ","Afterwards came also the other virgins
 saying
 Lord
 Lord
 open to us! ","But he answered and said
 Truly I say to you
 I know you not.","Watch
 therefore. For you know neither the day nor yet the hour when the Son of man will come.","Likewise it will be as a certain man
 ready to take his journey to a strange country
 called his servants and delivered his goods to them. ","And to one he gave five talents
 to another two
 and to another one \u2013 to every man according to his ability \u2013 and straightaway departed. ","Then he who had received the five talents went and traded with them
 and won another five talents. ","Likewise
 he who received two gained another two. ","But he who received the one went and dug a hole in the earth
 and hid his master\u2019s money.","After a long season
 the lord of those servants came and reckoned with them. ","Then came he that had received five talents
 and brought another five talents
 saying
 Master
 you delivered to me five talents; here
 I have gained with them five talents more. ","Then his master said to him
 Well done
 good and faithful servant. You have been faithful in a little; I will appoint you over much. Enter into your master\u2019s joy!","Also he who received two talents came and said
 Master
 you delivered to me two talents; here
 I have won two other talents with them. ","And his master said to him
 Well done
 good and faithful servant. You have been faithful in a little; I will appoint you over much. Go in
 into your master\u2019s joy.","Then he who had received the one talent came and said
 Master
 I considered that you were a hard man
 who reaps where you did not sow and gathers where you did not scatter
 ","and was therefore afraid
 and went and hid your talent in the earth. Here
 have your talent.","His master answered and said to him
 You evil servant
 and slothful: you knew that I reap where I did not sow
 and gather where I did not scatter? ","You ought therefore to have put my money with the moneychangers
 and then at my coming I would have received what is my own with profit. ","Take therefore the talent from him
 and give it to the one who has ten talents. ","For every person who has will be given more
 and he will have abundance; and from him who has not
 shall be taken away even what he has. ","And cast that unprofitable servant into outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.","When the Son of man comes in his glory
 and all the holy angels with him
 then shall he sit upon the seat of his glory. ","And before him shall be gathered all nations. And he will separate them one from another
 as a shepherd divides the sheep from the goats. ","And he will set the sheep on his right hand and the goats on the left.","Then shall the king say to those on his right hand
 Come ye blessed children of my Father
 inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the world. ","For I was hungry and you gave me food. I was thirsty and you gave me drink. I was homeless and you lodged me.","I was naked and you clothed me. I was sick and you visited me. I was in prison and you came to me.","Then the righteous will answer him
 saying
 Master
 when did we see you hungry and feed you
 or thirsty and give you drink? ","When did we see you homeless and lodge you
 or naked and clothe you? ","Or when did we see you sick
 or in prison
 and come to you? ","And the king will answer and say to them
 Truly I say to you
 inasmuch as you did it for one of the least of these my brethren
 you did it for me.","Then shall the king say to those who will be on the left hand
 Depart from me
 ye cursed
 into everlasting fire
 which is prepared for the devil and his angels. ","For I was hungry and you gave me no food. I was thirsty and you gave me no drink.","I was homeless and you did not lodge me. I was naked and you did not clothe me. I was sick
 and in prison
 and you did not visit me.","Then they also will answer him
 saying
 Master
 when did we see you hungry
 or thirsty
 or homeless
 or naked
 or sick
 or in prison
 and did not minister to you? ","Then shall he answer them and say
 Truly I say to you
 inasmuch as you did it not for one of the least of these
 you did it not for me. ","And these shall go into everlasting pain
 but the righteous into life eternal.","You know that after two days will be the Passover. And the Son of man will be delivered to be crucified.","When Jesus understood this he said to them
 Why do you trouble the woman? She has wrought a good work upon me. ","For you will have poor folk always with you
 but me you will not have always. ","And in that she poured this oyntment on my body
 she did it to bury me with. ","Truly I say to you
 wherever this gospel is preached throughout all the world
 there also will this that she has done be told
 for a memorial of her.","And he said
 Go into the city to a certain man
 and say to him
 The Master says
 My time is at hand; I will keep my Passover at your place with my disciples.","And as they were eating he said
 Truly I say to you that one of you will betray me. ","He answered and said
 He who dips his hand with me in the dish
 the same will betray me. ","The Son of man goes as it is written of him. But woe is to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed. It would have been good for that man if he had never been born.","Then Judas who betrayed him answered and said
 Is it I
 Master? Jesus said to him
 You have said it.","As they were eating
 Jesus took bread and gave thanks
 broke it
 and gave it to the disciples and said
 Take
 eat; this is my body. ","And he took the cup
 and thanked
 and gave it to them
 saying
 Drink of it
 everyone. ","For this is my blood of the new testament
 which is shed for many for the remission of sins. ","I say to you
 I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine until that day when I shall drink it new with you in my Father\u2019s kingdom.","Then Jesus said to them
 You will all fall away because of me this night. For it is written: I will smite the shepherd
 and the sheep of the flock will be scattered abroad. ","But after I am risen again
 I will go before you into Galilee.","Jesus said to him
 Truly I say to you that this same night
 before the cock crows
 you will deny me three times. ","Then Jesus went with them to a place which is called Gethsemane
 and said to the disciples
 Sit here while I go and pray yonder. ","Then said Jesus to them
 My soul is heavy
 even unto death. You stay here
 and watch with me.","And he went a little apart and fell flat on his face and prayed
 saying
 O my Father
 if it be possible
 let this cup pass from me; nevertheless
 not as I will
 but as you will.","And he came back to the disciples and found them asleep
 and said to Peter
 What
 could you not watch with me for one hour? ","Watch
 and pray that you do not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing
 but the flesh is weak.","He went away once more and prayed
 saying
 O my Father
 if this cup cannot pass away from me but that I drink of it
 thy will be fulfilled. ","Then he came to his disciples and said to them
 Sleep on now
 and take your rest! Take heed: the hour is at hand
 and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. ","Arise
 let us be going. Behold
 he who betrays me is at hand.","And Jesus said to him
 Friend
 why have you come? Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and took him.","Then said Jesus to him
 Put your sword back in its sheath. For all who take the sword will perish by the sword. ","Or do you think I cannot now pray to my Father
 and he would send me more than twelve legions of angels? ","But how then would the scriptures be fulfilled? For this is how it must be.","At the same time Jesus said to the throng
 You have come out as if against a thief
 with swords and clubs to take me. I sat daily teaching in the temple among you
 and you did not take me. ","All this was done so that the scriptures of the prophets may be fulfilled.","Jesus said to him
 It is as you have said. But I say to you
 hereafter you will see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power
 and come in the clouds of the sky.","And Peter remembered the words of Jesus
 who had said to him
 Before the cock crows
 you will deny me three times. And he went out at the doors and wept bitterly.","Jesus stood before the governor
 and the governor asked him
 saying
 Are you the king of the Jews? Jesus said to him
 It is as you say. ","And about the ninth hour
 Jesus cried out with a loud voice
 saying
 Eli
 Eli
 lama sabachthani? (which means
 My God
 my God
 why have you forsaken me?)","And as they went to tell his disciples
 behold
 Jesus met them
 saying
 All Hail! And they came and held him by the feet and worshipped him. ","Then said Jesus to them
 Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brethren to go into Galilee
 and there they will see me.","And Jesus came and spoke to them
 saying
 All power is given to me in heaven and in earth. ","Go therefore and teach all nations
 baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit
 ","and teaching them to observe all things
 whatsoever I commanded you. And lo
 I am with you always

 \u201cGo back
 and tell John what you hear and see: ","Blind people see again

 what did you go to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? Those who wear fine clothes are in royal palaces.","\u201cReally
 what did you go to see? A prophet? Let me tell you that he is far more than a prophet. ","John is the one about whom Scripture says

 and forceful people have been seizing it. ","All the Prophets and Moses\u2019 Teachings prophesied up to the time of John.","If you are willing to accept their message

 will you be lifted to heaven? No
 you will go down to hell! If the miracles that had been worked in you had been worked in Sodom

 \u201cI praise you

 for hiding these things from wise and intelligent people and revealing them to little children. ","Yes
 Father

 \u201cHaven\u2019t you read what David did when he and his men were hungry? ","Haven\u2019t you read how he went into the house of God and ate the bread of the presence?

 \u201cSuppose one of you has a sheep. If it falls into a pit on a day of worship
 wouldn\u2019t you take hold of it and lift it out? ","Certainly
 a human is more valuable than a sheep! So it is right to do good on the day of worship.\u201d","Then he said to the man
 \u201cHold out your hand.\u201d The man held it out
 and it became normal again
 as healthy as the other.","Since Yeshua knew what they were thinking
 he said to them
 \u201cEvery kingdom divided against itself is ruined. And every city or household divided against itself will not last. ","If Satan forces Satan out
 he is divided against himself. How
 then
 can his kingdom last? ","If I force demons out of people with the help of Beelzebul
 who helps your followers force them out? That\u2019s why they will be your judges. ","But if I force demons out with the help of God\u2019s Spirit

 or by your words you will be declared guilty.\u201d","He responded
 \u201cThe people of an evil and unfaithful era look for a miraculous sign. But the only sign they will get is the sign of the prophet Jonah. ","Just as Jonah was in the belly of a huge fish for three days and three nights
 so the Son of Man will be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights. ","The men of Nineveh will stand up with you at the time of judgment and will condemn you
 because they turned to God and changed the way they thought and acted when Jonah spoke his message. But look
 someone greater than Jonah is here! ","The queen from the south will stand up at the time of judgment with you. She will condemn you
 because she came from the ends of the earth to hear Solomon\u2019s wisdom. But look
 someone greater than Solomon is here!","\u201cWhen an evil spirit comes out of a person
 it goes through dry places looking for a place to rest. But it doesn\u2019t find any. ","Then it says
 \u2018I\u2019ll go back to the home I left.\u2019 When it arrives
 it finds the house unoccupied
 swept clean
 and in order. ","Then it goes and brings along seven other spirits more evil than itself. They enter and take up permanent residence there. In the end the condition of that person is worse than it was before. That is what will happen to the evil people of this day.\u201d","While Yeshua was still talking to the crowds
 his mother and brothers were standing outside. They wanted to talk to him. ","He replied to the man speaking to him
 \u201cWho is my mother
 and who are my brothers?\u201d ","Pointing with his hand at his disciples
 he said
 \u201cLook
 here are my mother and my brothers. ","Whoever does what my Father in heaven wants is my brother and sister and mother.\u201d","Then he used stories as illustrations to tell them many things. He said
 \u201cListen! A farmer went to plant seed. ","Some seeds were planted along the road
 and birds came and devoured them. ","Other seeds were planted on rocky ground
 where there was little soil. The plants sprouted quickly because the soil wasn\u2019t deep. ","But when the sun came up
 they were scorched. They withered because their roots weren\u2019t deep enough. ","Other seeds were planted among thornbushes
 and the thornbushes grew up and choked them. ","But other seeds were planted on good ground and produced grain. They produced one hundred
 sixty
 or thirty times as much as was planted. ","Let the person who has ears listen!\u201d","Yeshua answered
 \u201cKnowledge about the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you. But it has not been given to the crowd. ","Those who understand these mysteries will be given more knowledge
 and they will excel in understanding them. However
 some people don\u2019t understand these mysteries. Even what they understand will be taken away from them. ","This is why I speak to them this way. They see
 but they\u2019re blind. They hear
 but they don\u2019t listen. They don\u2019t even try to understand. ","So they make Isaiah\u2019s prophecy come true: \u2018You will hear clearly but never understand. You will see clearly but never comprehend.","These people have become close-minded and hard of hearing. They have shut their eyes so that their eyes never see. Their ears never hear. Their minds never understand. And they never return to me for healing!\u2019","\u201cBlessed are your eyes because they see and your ears because they hear.","I can guarantee this truth: Many prophets and many of God\u2019s people longed to see what you see but didn\u2019t see it
 to hear what you hear but didn\u2019t hear it.","\u201cListen to what the story about the farmer means.","Someone hears the word about the kingdom but doesn\u2019t understand it. The evil one comes at once and snatches away what was planted in him. This is what the seed planted along the road illustrates.","The seed planted on rocky ground is the person who hears the word and accepts it at once with joy.","Since he doesn\u2019t have any root
 he lasts only a little while. When suffering or persecution comes along because of the word
 he immediately falls from faith. ","The seed planted among thornbushes is another person who hears the word. But the worries of life and the deceitful pleasures of riches choke the word so that it can\u2019t produce anything.","But the seed planted on good ground is the person who hears and understands the word. This type produces crops. They produce one hundred
 sixty
 or thirty times as much as was planted.\u201d","Yeshua used another illustration. He said
 \u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like a man who planted good seed in his field. ","But while people were asleep
 his enemy planted weeds in the wheat field and went away. ","When the wheat came up and formed kernels
 weeds appeared.","\u201cThe owner\u2019s workers came to him and asked
 \u2018Sir
 didn\u2019t you plant good seed in your field? Where did the weeds come from?\u2019","\u201cHe told them
 \u2018An enemy did this.\u2019 \u201cHis workers asked him
 \u2018Do you want us to pull out the weeds?\u2019","\u201cHe replied
 \u2018No. If you pull out the weeds
 you may pull out the wheat with them. ","Let both grow together until the harvest. When the grain is cut
 I will tell the workers to gather the weeds first and tie them in bundles to be burned. But I\u2019ll have them bring the wheat into my barn.\u2019\u201d","Yeshua used another illustration. He said
 \u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that someone planted in a field. ","It\u2019s one of the smallest seeds. However
 when it has grown
 it is taller than the garden plants. It becomes a tree that is large enough for birds to nest in its branches.\u201d","He used another illustration. \u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman mixed into a large amount of flour until the yeast worked its way through all the dough.\u201d","He answered
 \u201cThe one who plants the good seeds is the Son of Man. ","The field is the world. The good seeds are those who belong to the kingdom. The weeds are those who belong to the evil one.","The enemy who planted them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the world. The workers are angels.","Just as weeds are gathered and burned
 so it will be at the end of time. ","The Son of Man will send his angels. They will gather everything in his kingdom that causes people to sin and everyone who does evil.","The angels will throw them into a blazing furnace. People will cry and be in extreme pain there.","Then the people who have God\u2019s approval will shine like the sun in their Father\u2019s kingdom. Let the person who has ears listen!","\u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like a treasure buried in a field. When a man discovered it
 he buried it again. He was so delighted with it that he went away
 sold everything he had
 and bought that field.","\u201cAlso
 the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant who was searching for fine pearls. ","When he found a valuable pearl
 he went away
 sold everything he had
 and bought it.","\u201cAlso
 the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea. It gathered all kinds of fish. ","When it was full
 they pulled it to the shore. Then they sat down
 gathered the good fish into containers
 and threw the bad ones away. ","The same thing will happen at the end of time. The angels will go out and separate the evil people from people who have God\u2019s approval.","Then the angels will throw the evil people into a blazing furnace. They will cry and be in extreme pain there.","\u201cHave you understood all of this?\u201d \u201cYes
\u201d they answered.","So Yeshua said to them
 \u201cThat is why every student of Scripture who has become a disciple of the kingdom of heaven is like a home owner. He brings new and old things out of his treasure chest.\u201d","So they took offense at him. But Yeshua said to them
 \u201cThe only place a prophet isn\u2019t honored is in his hometown and in his own house.\u201d","Yeshua said to them
 \u201cThey don\u2019t need to go away. You give them something to eat.\u201d","Yeshua said
 \u201cBring them to me.\u201d","Immediately
 Yeshua said
 \u201cCalm down! It\u2019s me. Don\u2019t be afraid!\u201d","Yeshua said
 \u201cCome!\u201d So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water toward Yeshua. ","Immediately
 Yeshua reached out
 caught hold of him
 and said
 \u201cYou have so little faith! Why did you doubt?\u201d","He answered them
 \u201cWhy do you break the commandment of God because of your traditions? ","For example
 God said
 \u2018Honor your father and your mother\u2019 and \u2018Whoever curses father or mother must be put to death.\u2019 ","But you say that whoever tells his father or mother
 \u2018I have given to God whatever support you might have received from me
\u2019 ","does not have to honor his father. Because of your traditions you have destroyed the authority of God\u2019s word.","You hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you:","\u2018These people honor me with their lips
 but their hearts are far from me.","Their worship of me is pointless
 because their teachings are rules made by humans.\u2019\u201d","Then he called the crowd and said to them
 \u201cListen and try to understand! ","What goes into a person\u2019s mouth doesn\u2019t make him unclean. It\u2019s what comes out of the mouth that makes a person unclean.\u201d","He answered
 \u201cAny plant that my heavenly Father did not plant will be uprooted. ","Leave them alone! They are blind leaders. When one blind person leads another
 both will fall into the same pit.\u201d","Yeshua said
 \u201cDon\u2019t you understand yet? ","Don\u2019t you know that whatever goes into the mouth goes into the stomach and then into a toilet?","But whatever goes out of the mouth comes from within
 and that\u2019s what makes a person unclean. ","Evil thoughts
 murder
 adultery
 other sexual sins
 stealing
 lying
 and cursing come from within. ","These are the things that make a person unclean. But eating without washing one\u2019s hands doesn\u2019t make a person unclean.\u201d","Yeshua responded
 \u201cI was sent only to the lost sheep of the nation of Israel.\u201d","Yeshua replied
 \u201cIt\u2019s not right to take the children\u2019s food and throw it to the dogs.\u201d","Then Yeshua answered her
 \u201cWoman
 you have strong faith! What you wanted will be done for you.\u201d At that moment her daughter was cured.","Yeshua called his disciples and said
 \u201cI feel sorry for the people. They have been with me three days now and have nothing to eat. I don\u2019t want to send them away hungry
 or they may become exhausted on their way home.\u201d","Yeshua asked them
 \u201cHow many loaves of bread do you have?\u201d They answered
 \u201cSeven
 and a few small fish.\u201d","He responded to them
 \u201cIn the evening you say that the weather will be fine because the sky is red. ","And in the morning you say that there will be a storm today because the sky is red and overcast. You can forecast the weather by judging the appearance of the sky
 but you cannot interpret the signs of the times.","\u201cEvil and unfaithful people look for a miraculous sign. But the only sign they will be given is that of Jonah.\u201d Then he left them standing there and went away.","Yeshua said to them
 \u201cBe careful! Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees!\u201d","Yeshua knew about their conversation and asked
 \u201cWhy are you discussing among yourselves that you don\u2019t have any bread? You have so little faith! ","Don\u2019t you understand yet? Don\u2019t you remember the five loaves for the five thousand and how many baskets you filled?","Don\u2019t you remember the seven loaves for the four thousand and how many large baskets you filled?","Why don\u2019t you understand that I wasn\u2019t talking to you about bread? Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees!\u201d","When Yeshua came to the region of Caesarea Philippi
 he asked his disciples
 \u201cWho do people say the Son of Man is?\u201d","He asked them
 \u201cBut who do you say I am?\u201d","Yeshua replied
 \u201cSimon
 son of Jonah
 you are blessed! No human revealed this to you

 and I can guarantee that on this rock I will build my church. And the gates of hell will not overpower it. ","I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you imprison
 God will imprison. And whatever you set free
 God will set free.\u201d","But Yeshua turned and said to Peter
 \u201cGet out of my way
 Satan! You are tempting me to sin. You aren\u2019t thinking the way God thinks but the way humans think.\u201d","Then Yeshua said to his disciples
 \u201cThose who want to come with me must say no to the things they want
 pick up their crosses
 and follow me. ","Those who want to save their lives will lose them. But those who lose their lives for me will find them.","What good will it do for people to win the whole world and lose their lives? Or what will a person give in exchange for life?","The Son of Man will come with his angels in his Father\u2019s glory. Then he will pay back each person based on what that person has done.","I can guarantee this truth: Some people who are standing here will not die until they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.\u201d","But Yeshua touched them and said
 \u201cGet up
 and don\u2019t be afraid!\u201d ","On their way down the mountain
 Yeshua ordered them
 \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone what you have seen. Wait until the Son of Man has been brought back to life.\u201d","Yeshua answered
 \u201cElijah is coming and will put everything in order again. ","Actually
 I can guarantee that Elijah has already come. Yet
 people treated him as they pleased because they didn\u2019t recognize him. In the same way they\u2019re going to make the Son of Man suffer.\u201d","Yeshua replied
 \u201cYou unbelieving and corrupt generation! How long must I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring him here to me!\u201d","He told them
 \u201cBecause you have so little faith. I can guarantee this truth: If your faith is the size of a mustard seed
 you can say to this mountain
 \u2018Move from here to there
\u2019 and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.\u201d","While they were traveling together in Galilee
 Yeshua told them
 \u201cThe Son of Man will be betrayed and handed over to people. ","They will kill him
 but on the third day he will be brought back to life.\u201d Then the disciples became very sad.","\u201cCertainly
\u201d he answered. Peter went into the house. Before he could speak
 Yeshua asked him
 \u201cWhat do you think
 Simon? From whom do the kings of the world collect fees or taxes? Is it from their family members or from other people?\u201d","\u201cFrom other people
\u201d Peter answered. Yeshua said to him
 \u201cThen the family members are exempt. ","However
 so that we don\u2019t create a scandal
 go to the sea and throw in a hook. Take the first fish that you catch. Open its mouth
 and you will find a coin. Give that coin to them for you and me.\u201d","Then he said to them
 \u201cI can guarantee this truth: Unless you change and become like little children
 you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. ","Whoever becomes like this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.","And whoever welcomes a child like this in my name welcomes me.","\u201cThese little ones believe in me. It would be best for the person who causes one of them to lose faith to be drowned in the sea with a large stone hung around his neck.","How horrible it will be for the world because it causes people to lose their faith. Situations that cause people to lose their faith will arise. How horrible it will be for the person who causes someone to lose his faith!","\u201cIf your hand or your foot causes you to lose your faith
 cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life disabled or injured than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into everlasting fire. ","If your eye causes you to lose your faith
 tear it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hellfire.","\u201cBe careful not to despise these little ones. I can guarantee that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father
 who is in heaven.","\u201cWhat do you think? Suppose a man has 100 sheep and one of them strays. Won\u2019t he leave the 99 sheep in the hills to look for the one that has strayed?","I can guarantee this truth: If he finds it
 he is happier about it than about the 99 that have not strayed. ","In the same way
 your Father in heaven does not want one of these little ones to be lost.","\u201cIf a believer does something wrong
 go
 confront him when the two of you are alone. If he listens to you
 you have won back that believer. ","But if he does not listen
 take one or two others with you so that every accusation may be verified by two or three witnesses. ","If he ignores these witnesses
 tell it to the community of believers. If he also ignores the community
 deal with him as you would a heathen or a tax collector. ","I can guarantee this truth: Whatever you imprison
 God will imprison. And whatever you set free

 my Father in heaven will accept it. ","Where two or three have come together in my name
 I am there among them.\u201d","Yeshua answered him
 \u201cI tell you
 not just seven times
 but seventy times seven.","\u201cThat is why the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.","When he began to do this
 a servant who owed him millions of dollars was brought to him. ","Because he could not pay off the debt
 the master ordered him
 his wife
 his children

 freed him
 and canceled his debt. ","But when that servant went away
 he found a servant who owed him hundreds of dollars. He grabbed the servant he found and began to choke him. \u2018Pay what you owe!\u2019 he said.","\u201cThen that other servant fell at his feet and begged him
 \u2018Be patient with me
 and I will repay you.\u2019 ","But he refused. Instead
 he turned away and had that servant put into prison until he would repay what he owed.","\u201cThe other servants who worked with him saw what had happened and felt very sad. They told their master the whole story.","\u201cThen his master sent for him and said to him
 \u2018You evil servant! I canceled your entire debt

 \u2018That\u2019s why a man will leave his father and mother and will remain united with his wife

 don\u2019t let anyone separate what God has joined together.\u201d","Yeshua answered them

 \u201cNot everyone can do what you suggest. Only those who have that gift can. ","For example
 some men are celibate because they were born that way. Others are celibate because they were castrated. Still others have decided to be celibate because of the kingdom of heaven. If anyone can do what you\u2019ve suggested

 obey the commandments.\u201d","\u201cWhich commandments?\u201d the man asked. Yeshua said
 \u201cNever murder. Never commit adultery. Never steal. Never give false testimony. ","Honor your father and mother. Love your neighbor as you love yourself.\u201d","Yeshua said to him

 sell what you own. Give the money to the poor

Whoever wants to become great among you will be your servant.","Whoever wants to be most important among you will be your slave.","It\u2019s the same way with the Son of Man.

 he said to them
 \u201cWhy are you bothering this woman? She has done a beautiful thing for me. ","You will always have the poor with you

 \u201cGo to a certain man in the city
 and tell him that the teacher says
 \u2018My time is near. I will celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your house.\u2019\u201d","While they were eating
 he said
 \u201cI can guarantee this truth: One of you is going to betray me.\u201d","Yeshua answered
 \u201cSomeone who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me. ","The Son of Man is going to die as the Scriptures say he will. But how horrible it will be for that person who betrays the Son of Man. It would have been better for that person if he had never been born.\u201d","Then Judas
 who betrayed him
 asked
 \u201cYou don\u2019t mean me
 do you
 Rabbi?\u201d \u201cYes
 I do
\u201d Yeshua replied.","While they were eating
 Yeshua took bread and blessed it. He broke the bread
 gave it to his disciples
 and said
 \u201cTake this
 and eat it. This is my body.\u201d","Then he took a cup and spoke a prayer of thanksgiving. He gave it to them and said
 \u201cDrink from it
 all of you. ","This is my blood
 the blood of the promise. It is poured out for many people so that sins are forgiven.","\u201cI can guarantee that I won\u2019t drink this wine again until that day when I drink new wine with you in my Father\u2019s kingdom.\u201d","Then Yeshua said to them
 \u201cAll of you will abandon me tonight. Scripture says
 \u2018I will strike the shepherd
 and the sheep in the flock will be scattered.\u2019","\u201cBut after I am brought back to life
 I will go to Galilee ahead of you.\u201d","Yeshua replied to Peter
 \u201cI can guarantee this truth: Before a rooster crows tonight
 you will say three times that you don\u2019t know me.\u201d","Then Yeshua went with the disciples to a place called Gethsemane. He said to them
 \u201cStay here while I go over there and pray.\u201d","Then he said to them
 \u201cMy anguish is so great that I feel as if I\u2019m dying. Wait here
 and stay awake with me.\u201d","After walking a little farther
 he quickly bowed with his face to the ground and prayed
 \u201cFather
 if it\u2019s possible
 let this cup of suffering be taken away from me. But let your will be done rather than mine.\u201d","When he went back to the disciples
 he found them asleep. He said to Peter
 \u201cCouldn\u2019t you stay awake with me for one hour? ","Stay awake
 and pray that you won\u2019t be tempted. You want to do what\u2019s right

 \u201cFather
 if this cup cannot be taken away unless I drink it
 let your will be done.\u201d","Then he came back to the disciples and said to them
 \u201cYou might as well sleep now. The time is near for the Son of Man to be handed over to sinners. ","Get up! Let\u2019s go! The one who is betraying me is near.\u201d","Yeshua said to him
 \u201cFriend
 why are you here?\u201d Then some men came forward
 took hold of Yeshua
 and arrested him. ","Then Yeshua said to him
 \u201cPut your sword away! All who use a sword will be killed by a sword. ","Don\u2019t you think that I could call on my Father to send more than twelve legions of angels to help me now?","How
 then
 are the Scriptures to be fulfilled that say this must happen?\u201d","At that time Yeshua said to the crowd
 \u201cHave you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me as if I were a criminal? I used to sit teaching in the temple courtyard every day. But you didn\u2019t arrest me then.

 \u201cYes
 I am. But I can guarantee that from now on you will see the Son of Man in the highest position in heaven. He will be coming on the clouds of heaven.\u201d","Peter remembered what Yeshua had said: \u201cBefore a rooster crows

 \u201cMy God
 my God

 Yeshua met them and greeted them. They went up to him
 bowed down to worship him
 and took hold of his feet.","Then Yeshua said to them
 \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid! Go
 tell my followers to go to Galilee. There they will see me.\u201d","When Yeshua came near
 he spoke to them. He said
 \u201cAll authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. ","So wherever you go
 make disciples of all nations: Baptize them in the name of the Father

 and of the Holy Spirit. ","Teach them to do everything I have commanded you. \u201cAnd remember that I am always with you until the end of time.\u201d","But Jesus answered him
 \u2018Let it be so now; for it is proper for us in this way to fulfil all righteousness.\u2019 Then he consented. ","But he answered
 \u2018It is written
 \u201cOne does not live by bread alone

 for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.","\u2018Blessed are those who mourn
 for they will be comforted.","\u2018Blessed are the meek
 for they will inherit the earth.","\u2018Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness
 for they will be filled.","\u2018Blessed are the merciful
 for they will receive mercy.","\u2018Blessed are the pure in heart
 for they will see God.","\u2018Blessed are the peacemakers
 for they will be called children of God.","\u2018Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness\u2019 sake
 for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.","\u2018Blessed are you when people revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account.","Rejoice and be glad
 for your reward is great in heaven
 for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.","\u2018You are the salt of the earth; but if salt has lost its taste
 how can its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything
 but is thrown out and trampled under foot.","\u2018You are the light of the world. A city built on a hill cannot be hidden.","No one after lighting a lamp puts it under the bushel basket
 but on the lampstand
 and it gives light to all in the house. ","In the same way
 let your light shine before others
 so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father in heaven.","\u2018Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets; I have come not to abolish but to fulfil.","For truly I tell you
 until heaven and earth pass away
 not one letter
 not one stroke of a letter
 will pass from the law until all is accomplished. ","Therefore
 whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments
 and teaches others to do the same
 will be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. ","For I tell you
 unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees
 you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.","\u2018You have heard that it was said to those of ancient times
 \u201cYou shall not murder\u201d; and \u201cwhoever murders shall be liable to judgement.\u201d ","But I say to you that if you are angry with a brother or sister
 you will be liable to judgement; and if you insult a brother or sister
 you will be liable to the council; and if you say
 \u201cYou fool\u201d
 you will be liable to the hell of fire. ","So when you are offering your gift at the altar
 if you remember that your brother or sister has something against you
 ","leave your gift there before the altar and go; first be reconciled to your brother or sister
 and then come and offer your gift. ","Come to terms quickly with your accuser while you are on the way to court with him
 or your accuser may hand you over to the judge
 and the judge to the guard
 and you will be thrown into prison. ","Truly I tell you
 you will never get out until you have paid the last penny.","\u2018You have heard that it was said
 \u201cYou shall not commit adultery.\u201d ","But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her in his heart.","If your right eye causes you to sin
 tear it out and throw it away; it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. ","And if your right hand causes you to sin
 cut it off and throw it away; it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to go into hell.","\u2018It was also said
 \u201cWhoever divorces his wife
 let him give her a certificate of divorce.\u201d ","But I say to you that anyone who divorces his wife
 except on the ground of unchastity
 causes her to commit adultery; and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.","\u2018Again
 you have heard that it was said to those of ancient times
 \u201cYou shall not swear falsely
 but carry out the vows you have made to the Lord.\u201d ","But I say to you
 Do not swear at all
 either by heaven
 for it is the throne of God
 ","or by the earth
 for it is his footstool
 or by Jerusalem
 for it is the city of the great King. ","And do not swear by your head
 for you cannot make one hair white or black. ","Let your word be \u201cYes
 Yes\u201d or \u201cNo
 No\u201d; anything more than this comes from the evil one.","\u2018You have heard that it was said
 \u201cAn eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.\u201d ","But I say to you
 Do not resist an evildoer. But if anyone strikes you on the right cheek
 turn the other also; ","and if anyone wants to sue you and take your coat
 give your cloak as well; ","and if anyone forces you to go one mile
 go also the second mile. ","Give to everyone who begs from you
 and do not refuse anyone who wants to borrow from you.","\u2018You have heard that it was said
 \u201cYou shall love your neighbour and hate your enemy.\u201d ","But I say to you
 Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you
 ","so that you may be children of your Father in heaven; for he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good
 and sends rain on the righteous and on the unrighteous. ","For if you love those who love you
 what reward do you have? Do not even the tax-collectors do the same? ","And if you greet only your brothers and sisters
 what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same? ","Be perfect
 therefore
 as your heavenly Father is perfect.","\u2018Beware of practising your piety before others in order to be seen by them; for then you have no reward from your Father in heaven.","\u2018So whenever you give alms
 do not sound a trumpet before you
 as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets
 so that they may be praised by others. Truly I tell you
 they have received their reward. ","But when you give alms
 do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing
 ","so that your alms may be done in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.","\u2018And whenever you pray
 do not be like the hypocrites; for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners
 so that they may be seen by others. Truly I tell you
 they have received their reward. ","But whenever you pray
 go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.","\u2018When you are praying
 do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do; for they think that they will be heard because of their many words. ","Do not be like them
 for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.","\u2018Pray then in this way: Our Father in heaven
 hallowed be your name.","    Your kingdom come. Your will be done
 on earth as it is in heaven.","Give us this day our daily bread.","    And forgive us our debts
 as we also have forgiven our debtors.","    And do not bring us to the time of trial
 but rescue us from the evil one.","For if you forgive others their trespasses
 your heavenly Father will also forgive you; ","but if you do not forgive others
 neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.","\u2018And whenever you fast
 do not look dismal
 like the hypocrites
 for they disfigure their faces so as to show others that they are fasting. Truly I tell you
 they have received their reward. ","But when you fast
 put oil on your head and wash your face
 ","so that your fasting may be seen not by others but by your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.","\u2018Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth
 where moth and rust consume and where thieves break in and steal; ","but store up for yourselves treasures in heaven
 where neither moth nor rust consumes and where thieves do not break in and steal. ","For where your treasure is
 there your heart will be also.","\u2018The eye is the lamp of the body. So
 if your eye is healthy
 your whole body will be full of light; ","but if your eye is unhealthy
 your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light in you is darkness
 how great is the darkness!","\u2018No one can serve two masters; for a slave will either hate the one and love the other
 or be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth.","\u2018Therefore I tell you
 do not worry about your life
 what you will eat or what you will drink
 or about your body
 what you will wear. Is not life more than food
 and the body more than clothing? ","Look at the birds of the air; they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns
 and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? ","And can any of you by worrying add a single hour to your span of life?","And why do you worry about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field
 how they grow; they neither toil nor spin
 ","yet I tell you
 even Solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these. ","But if God so clothes the grass of the field
 which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven
 will he not much more clothe you\u2014you of little faith? ","Therefore do not worry
 saying
 \u201cWhat will we eat?\u201d or \u201cWhat will we drink?\u201d or \u201cWhat will we wear?\u201d ","For it is the Gentiles who strive for all these things; and indeed your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.","But strive first for the kingdom of God and his righteousness
 and all these things will be given to you as well.","\u2018So do not worry about tomorrow
 for tomorrow will bring worries of its own. Today\u2019s trouble is enough for today.","\u2018Do not judge
 so that you may not be judged. ","For with the judgement you make you will be judged
 and the measure you give will be the measure you get. ","Why do you see the speck in your neighbour\u2019s eye
 but do not notice the log in your own eye? ","Or how can you say to your neighbour
 \u201cLet me take the speck out of your eye\u201d
 while the log is in your own eye? ","You hypocrite
 first take the log out of your own eye
 and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your neighbour\u2019s eye.","\u2018Do not give what is holy to dogs; and do not throw your pearls before swine
 or they will trample them under foot and turn and maul you.","\u2018Ask
 and it will be given to you; search
 and you will find; knock
 and the door will be opened for you. ","For everyone who asks receives
 and everyone who searches finds
 and for everyone who knocks
 the door will be opened. ","Is there anyone among you who
 if your child asks for bread
 will give a stone? ","Or if the child asks for a fish
 will give a snake? ","If you then
 who are evil
 know how to give good gifts to your children
 how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask him!","\u2018In everything do to others as you would have them do to you; for this is the law and the prophets.","\u2018Enter through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the road is easy that leads to destruction
 and there are many who take it. ","For the gate is narrow and the road is hard that leads to life
 and there are few who find it.","\u2018Beware of false prophets
 who come to you in sheep\u2019s clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves. ","You will know them by their fruits. Are grapes gathered from thorns
 or figs from thistles? ","In the same way
 every good tree bears good fruit
 but the bad tree bears bad fruit. ","A good tree cannot bear bad fruit
 nor can a bad tree bear good fruit. ","Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.","Thus you will know them by their fruits.","\u2018Not everyone who says to me
 \u201cLord
 Lord\u201d
 will enter the kingdom of heaven
 but only one who does the will of my Father in heaven. ","On that day many will say to me
 \u201cLord
 Lord
 did we not prophesy in your name
 and cast out demons in your name
 and do many deeds of power in your name?\u201d ","Then I will declare to them
 \u201cI never knew you; go away from me
 you evildoers.\u201d","\u2018Everyone then who hears these words of mine and acts on them will be like a wise man who built his house on rock.","The rain fell
 the floods came

 and it fell\u2014and great was its fall!\u2019","He stretched out his hand and touched him
 saying
 \u2018I do choose. Be made clean!\u2019 Immediately his leprosy was cleansed. ","Then Jesus said to him
 \u2018See that you say nothing to anyone; but go
 show yourself to the priest
 and offer the gift that Moses commanded
 as a testimony to them.\u2019","And he said to him
 \u2018I will come and cure him.\u2019 ","When Jesus heard him
 he was amazed and said to those who followed him
 \u2018Truly I tell you
 in no one in Israel have I found such faith. ","I tell you
 many will come from east and west and will eat with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven
 ","while the heirs of the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness
 where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\u2019 ","And to the centurion Jesus said
 \u2018Go; let it be done for you according to your faith.\u2019 And the servant was healed in that hour.","And Jesus said to him
 \u2018Foxes have holes
 and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.\u2019 ","But Jesus said to him
 \u2018Follow me
 and let the dead bury their own dead.\u2019","And he said to them
 \u2018Why are you afraid
 you of little faith?\u2019 Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a dead calm. ","And he said to them
 \u2018Go!\u2019 So they came out and entered the swine; and suddenly
 the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and perished in the water. ","And just then some people were carrying a paralysed man lying on a bed. When Jesus saw their faith
 he said to the paralytic
 \u2018Take heart
 son; your sins are forgiven.\u2019 ","But Jesus
 perceiving their thoughts
 said
 \u2018Why do you think evil in your hearts? ","For which is easier
 to say
 \u201cYour sins are forgiven\u201d
 or to say
 \u201cStand up and walk\u201d? ","But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins\u2019\u2014he then said to the paralytic\u2014\u2018Stand up
 take your bed and go to your home.\u2019 ","As Jesus was walking along
 he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax booth; and he said to him
 \u2018Follow me.\u2019 And he got up and followed him.","But when he heard this
 he said
 \u2018Those who are well have no need of a physician
 but those who are sick. ","Go and learn what this means
 \u201cI desire mercy
 not sacrifice.\u201d For I have come to call not the righteous but sinners.\u2019","And Jesus said to them
 \u2018The wedding-guests cannot mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them
 can they? The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them
 and then they will fast. ","No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old cloak
 for the patch pulls away from the cloak
 and a worse tear is made. ","Neither is new wine put into old wineskins; otherwise
 the skins burst
 and the wine is spilled
 and the skins are destroyed; but new wine is put into fresh wineskins

 and seeing her he said
 \u2018Take heart

 \u2018Go away; for the girl is not dead but sleeping.\u2019 And they laughed at him. ","When he entered the house

 \u2018Yes

 \u2018See that no one knows of this.\u2019 ","Then he said to his disciples
 \u2018The harvest is plentiful
 but the labourers are few; ","therefore ask the Lord of the harvest to send out labourers into his harvest.\u2019","These twelve Jesus sent out with the following instructions: \u2018Go nowhere among the Gentiles

 raise the dead
 cleanse the lepers

 find out who in it is worthy

 greet it. ","If the house is worthy
 let your peace come upon it; but if it is not worthy
 let your peace return to you. ","If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words
 shake off the dust from your feet as you leave that house or town. ","Truly I tell you
 it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgement than for that town.","\u2018See
 I am sending you out like sheep into the midst of wolves; so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves. ","Beware of them
 for they will hand you over to councils and flog you in their synagogues; ","and you will be dragged before governors and kings because of me
 as a testimony to them and the Gentiles. ","When they hand you over
 do not worry about how you are to speak or what you are to say; for what you are to say will be given to you at that time; ","for it is not you who speak
 but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you. ","Brother will betray brother to death

 flee to the next; for truly I tell you
 you will not have gone through all the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.","\u2018A disciple is not above the teacher
 nor a slave above the master; ","it is enough for the disciple to be like the teacher

 tell in the light; and what you hear whispered
 proclaim from the housetops. ","Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.","Are not two sparrows sold for a penny?

 I also will acknowledge before my Father in heaven; ","but whoever denies me before others

 Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: \u2018What did you go out into the wilderness to look at? A reed shaken by the wind? ","What then did you go out to see? Someone dressed in soft robes? Look
 those who wear soft robes are in royal palaces. ","What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes
 I tell you
 and more than a prophet. ","This is the one about whom it is written
 \u201cSee
 I am sending my messenger ahead of you
 who will prepare your way before you.\u201d","Truly I tell you
 among those born of women no one has arisen greater than John the Baptist; yet the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. ","From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has suffered violence
 and the violent take it by force. ","For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John came;","and if you are willing to accept it
 he is Elijah who is to come. ","Let anyone with ears listen!","\u2018But to what will I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the market-places and calling to one another
","\u201cWe played the flute for you
 and you did not dance; we wailed
 and you did not mourn.\u201d","For John came neither eating nor drinking
 and they say
 \u201cHe has a demon\u201d; ","the Son of Man came eating and drinking
 and they say
 \u201cLook
 a glutton and a drunkard
 a friend of tax-collectors and sinners!\u201d Yet wisdom is vindicated by her deeds.\u2019","Then he began to reproach the cities in which most of his deeds of power had been done
 because they did not repent. ","\u2018Woe to you
 Chorazin! Woe to you
 Bethsaida! For if the deeds of power done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon
 they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. ","But I tell you
 on the day of judgement it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon than for you. ","And you
 Capernaum
 will you be exalted to heaven? No
 you will be brought down to Hades. For if the deeds of power done in you had been done in Sodom
 it would have remained until this day. ","But I tell you that on the day of judgement it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom than for you.\u2019","At that time Jesus said
 \u2018I thank you
 Father
 Lord of heaven and earth
 because you have hidden these things from the wise and the intelligent and have revealed them to infants; ","yes
 Father
 for such was your gracious will. ","All things have been handed over to me by my Father; and no one knows the Son except the Father
 and no one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.","\u2018Come to me
 all you that are weary and are carrying heavy burdens
 and I will give you rest. ","Take my yoke upon you
 and learn from me; for I am gentle and humble in heart
 and you will find rest for your souls. ","For my yoke is easy
 and my burden is light.\u2019","He said to them
 \u2018Have you not read what David did when he and his companions were hungry? ","He entered the house of God and ate the bread of the Presence
 which it was not lawful for him or his companions to eat
 but only for the priests. ","Or have you not read in the law that on the sabbath the priests in the temple break the sabbath and yet are guiltless?","I tell you
 something greater than the temple is here. ","But if you had known what this means
 \u201cI desire mercy and not sacrifice\u201d
 you would not have condemned the guiltless. ","For the Son of Man is lord of the sabbath.\u2019","He said to them
 \u2018Suppose one of you has only one sheep and it falls into a pit on the sabbath; will you not lay hold of it and lift it out? ","How much more valuable is a human being than a sheep! So it is lawful to do good on the sabbath.\u2019","Then he said to the man
 \u2018Stretch out your hand.\u2019 He stretched it out
 and it was restored
 as sound as the other. ","He knew what they were thinking and said to them
 \u2018Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste
 and no city or house divided against itself will stand. ","If Satan casts out Satan
 he is divided against himself; how then will his kingdom stand? ","If I cast out demons by Beelzebul
 by whom do your own exorcists cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges. ","But if it is by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons
 then the kingdom of God has come to you. ","Or how can one enter a strong man\u2019s house and plunder his property
 without first tying up the strong man? Then indeed the house can be plundered. ","Whoever is not with me is against me
 and whoever does not gather with me scatters. ","Therefore I tell you
 people will be forgiven for every sin and blasphemy
 but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. ","Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven
 but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven
 either in this age or in the age to come.","\u2018Either make the tree good
 and its fruit good; or make the tree bad
 and its fruit bad; for the tree is known by its fruit. ","You brood of vipers! How can you speak good things
 when you are evil? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. ","The good person brings good things out of a good treasure
 and the evil person brings evil things out of an evil treasure. ","I tell you
 on the day of judgement you will have to give an account for every careless word you utter; ","for by your words you will be justified
 and by your words you will be condemned.\u2019","But he answered them
 \u2018An evil and adulterous generation asks for a sign
 but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. ","For just as Jonah was for three days and three nights in the belly of the sea monster
 so for three days and three nights the Son of Man will be in the heart of the earth. ","The people of Nineveh will rise up at the judgement with this generation and condemn it
 because they repented at the proclamation of Jonah
 and see
 something greater than Jonah is here! ","The queen of the South will rise up at the judgement with this generation and condemn it
 because she came from the ends of the earth to listen to the wisdom of Solomon
 and see
 something greater than Solomon is here!","\u2018When the unclean spirit has gone out of a person
 it wanders through waterless regions looking for a resting-place
 but it finds none. ","Then it says
 \u201cI will return to my house from which I came.\u201d When it comes
 it finds it empty
 swept
 and put in order. ","Then it goes and brings along seven other spirits more evil than itself
 and they enter and live there; and the last state of that person is worse than the first. So will it be also with this evil generation.\u2019","While he was still speaking to the crowds
 his mother and his brothers were standing outside
 wanting to speak to him. ","But to the one who had told him this
 Jesus replied
 \u2018Who is my mother
 and who are my brothers?\u2019 ","And pointing to his disciples
 he said
 \u2018Here are my mother and my brothers! ","For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.\u2019","And he told them many things in parables
 saying: \u2018Listen! A sower went out to sow. ","And as he sowed
 some seeds fell on the path
 and the birds came and ate them up. ","Other seeds fell on rocky ground
 where they did not have much soil
 and they sprang up quickly
 since they had no depth of soil. ","But when the sun rose
 they were scorched; and since they had no root
 they withered away. ","Other seeds fell among thorns
 and the thorns grew up and choked them. ","Other seeds fell on good soil and brought forth grain
 some a hundredfold
 some sixty
 some thirty. ","Let anyone with ears listen!\u2019","He answered
 \u2018To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven
 but to them it has not been given. ","For to those who have
 more will be given
 and they will have an abundance; but from those who have nothing
 even what they have will be taken away. ","The reason I speak to them in parables is that \u201cseeing they do not perceive
 and hearing they do not listen
 nor do they understand.\u201d ","With them indeed is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah that says: \u201cYou will indeed listen
 but never understand
 and you will indeed look
 but never perceive.","For this people\u2019s heart has grown dull
 and their ears are hard of hearing
 and they have shut their eyes; so that they might not look with their eyes
 and listen with their ears
 and understand with their heart and turn\u2014 and I would heal them.\u201d","But blessed are your eyes
 for they see
 and your ears
 for they hear. ","Truly I tell you
 many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see
 but did not see it
 and to hear what you hear
 but did not hear it.","\u2018Hear then the parable of the sower.","When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it
 the evil one comes and snatches away what is sown in the heart; this is what was sown on the path. ","As for what was sown on rocky ground
 this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy; ","yet such a person has no root
 but endures only for a while
 and when trouble or persecution arises on account of the word
 that person immediately falls away. ","As for what was sown among thorns
 this is the one who hears the word
 but the cares of the world and the lure of wealth choke the word
 and it yields nothing. ","But as for what was sown on good soil
 this is the one who hears the word and understands it
 who indeed bears fruit and yields
 in one case a hundredfold
 in another sixty
 and in another thirty.\u2019","He put before them another parable: \u2018The kingdom of heaven may be compared to someone who sowed good seed in his field;","but while everybody was asleep
 an enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat
 and then went away. ","So when the plants came up and bore grain
 then the weeds appeared as well. ","And the slaves of the householder came and said to him
 \u201cMaster
 did you not sow good seed in your field? Where
 then
 did these weeds come from?\u201d ","He answered
 \u201cAn enemy has done this.\u201d The slaves said to him
 \u201cThen do you want us to go and gather them?\u201d ","But he replied
 \u201cNo; for in gathering the weeds you would uproot the wheat along with them. ","Let both of them grow together until the harvest; and at harvest time I will tell the reapers
 Collect the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned
 but gather the wheat into my barn.\u201d\u2019","He put before them another parable: \u2018The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that someone took and sowed in his field;","it is the smallest of all the seeds
 but when it has grown it is the greatest of shrubs and becomes a tree
 so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches.\u2019","He told them another parable: \u2018The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed in with three measures of flour until all of it was leavened.\u2019","He answered
 \u2018The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man; ","the field is the world
 and the good seed are the children of the kingdom; the weeds are the children of the evil one
 ","and the enemy who sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the age
 and the reapers are angels. ","Just as the weeds are collected and burned up with fire
 so will it be at the end of the age. ","The Son of Man will send his angels
 and they will collect out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all evildoers
 ","and they will throw them into the furnace of fire
 where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. ","Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Let anyone with ears listen!","\u2018The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field
 which someone found and hid; then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.","\u2018Again
 the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls; ","on finding one pearl of great value
 he went and sold all that he had and bought it.","\u2018Again
 the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea and caught fish of every kind; ","when it was full
 they drew it ashore
 sat down
 and put the good into baskets but threw out the bad. ","So it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come out and separate the evil from the righteous","and throw them into the furnace of fire
 where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.","\u2018Have you understood all this?\u2019 They answered
 \u2018Yes.\u2019 ","And he said to them
 \u2018Therefore every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a household who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old.\u2019 ","And they took offence at him. But Jesus said to them
 \u2018Prophets are not without honour except in their own country and in their own house.\u2019 ","Jesus said to them
 \u2018They need not go away; you give them something to eat.\u2019 ","And he said
 \u2018Bring them here to me.\u2019 ","But immediately Jesus spoke to them and said
 \u2018Take heart
 it is I; do not be afraid.\u2019","He said
 \u2018Come.\u2019 So Peter got out of the boat
 started walking on the water
 and came towards Jesus. ","Jesus immediately reached out his hand and caught him
 saying to him
 \u2018You of little faith
 why did you doubt?\u2019 ","He answered them
 \u2018And why do you break the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition? ","For God said
 \u201cHonour your father and your mother
\u201d and
 \u201cWhoever speaks evil of father or mother must surely die.\u201d ","But you say that whoever tells father or mother
 \u201cWhatever support you might have had from me is given to God\u201d
 then that person need not honour the father. ","So
 for the sake of your tradition
 you make void the word of God. ","You hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied rightly about you when he said:","\u201cThis people honours me with their lips
 but their hearts are far from me;","in vain do they worship me
 teaching human precepts as doctrines.\u201d\u2019","Then he called the crowd to him and said to them
 \u2018Listen and understand: ","it is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person
 but it is what comes out of the mouth that defiles.\u2019 ","He answered
 \u2018Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted. ","Let them alone; they are blind guides of the blind. And if one blind person guides another
 both will fall into a pit.\u2019 ","Then he said
 \u2018Are you also still without understanding? ","Do you not see that whatever goes into the mouth enters the stomach
 and goes out into the sewer? ","But what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart
 and this is what defiles. ","For out of the heart come evil intentions
 murder
 adultery
 fornication
 theft
 false witness
 slander. ","These are what defile a person
 but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile.\u2019","He answered
 \u2018I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\u2019 ","He answered
 \u2018It is not fair to take the children\u2019s food and throw it to the dogs.\u2019 ","Then Jesus answered her
 \u2018Woman
 great is your faith! Let it be done for you as you wish.\u2019 And her daughter was healed instantly.","Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said
 \u2018I have compassion for the crowd
 because they have been with me now for three days and have nothing to eat; and I do not want to send them away hungry
 for they might faint on the way.\u2019 ","Jesus asked them
 \u2018How many loaves have you?\u2019 They said
 \u2018Seven
 and a few small fish.\u2019 ","He answered them
 \u2018When it is evening
 you say
 \u201cIt will be fair weather
 for the sky is red.\u201d ","And in the morning
 \u201cIt will be stormy today
 for the sky is red and threatening.\u201d You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky
 but you cannot interpret the signs of the times. ","An evil and adulterous generation asks for a sign
 but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah.\u2019 Then he left them and went away.","Jesus said to them
 \u2018Watch out
 and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\u2019 ","And becoming aware of it
 Jesus said
 \u2018You of little faith
 why are you talking about having no bread? ","Do you still not perceive? Do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand
 and how many baskets you gathered? ","Or the seven loaves for the four thousand
 and how many baskets you gathered? ","How could you fail to perceive that I was not speaking about bread? Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees!\u2019","Now when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi
 he asked his disciples
 \u2018Who do people say that the Son of Man is?\u2019 ","He said to them
 \u2018But who do you say that I am?\u2019 ","And Jesus answered him
 \u2018Blessed are you
 Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you
 but my Father in heaven. ","And I tell you
 you are Peter
 and on this rock I will build my church
 and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it. ","I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven
 and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven
 and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.\u2019 ","But he turned and said to Peter
 \u2018Get behind me
 Satan! You are a stumbling-block to me; for you are setting your mind not on divine things but on human things.\u2019","Then Jesus told his disciples
 \u2018If any want to become my followers
 let them deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me. ","For those who want to save their life will lose it
 and those who lose their life for my sake will find it. ","For what will it profit them if they gain the whole world but forfeit their life? Or what will they give in return for their life?","\u2018For the Son of Man is to come with his angels in the glory of his Father
 and then he will repay everyone for what has been done. ","Truly I tell you
 there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.\u2019","But Jesus came and touched them
 saying
 \u2018Get up and do not be afraid.\u2019 ","As they were coming down the mountain
 Jesus ordered them
 \u2018Tell no one about the vision until after the Son of Man has been raised from the dead.\u2019 ","He replied
 \u2018Elijah is indeed coming and will restore all things; ","but I tell you that Elijah has already come
 and they did not recognize him
 but they did to him whatever they pleased. So also the Son of Man is about to suffer at their hands.\u2019 ","Jesus answered
 \u2018You faithless and perverse generation
 how much longer must I be with you? How much longer must I put up with you? Bring him here to me.\u2019 ","He said to them
 \u2018Because of your little faith. For truly I tell you
 if you have faith the size of a mustard seed
 you will say to this mountain
 \u201cMove from here to there\u201d
 and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you.\u2019","As they were gathering in Galilee
 Jesus said to them
 \u2018The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into human hands
 ","and they will kill him
 and on the third day he will be raised.\u2019 And they were greatly distressed.","He said
 \u2018Yes
 he does.\u2019 And when he came home
 Jesus spoke of it first
 asking
 \u2018What do you think
 Simon? From whom do kings of the earth take toll or tribute? From their children or from others?\u2019 ","When Peter said
 \u2018From others\u2019
 Jesus said to him
 \u2018Then the children are free. ","However
 so that we do not give offence to them
 go to the lake and cast a hook; take the first fish that comes up; and when you open its mouth
 you will find a coin; take that and give it to them for you and me.\u2019","and said
 \u2018Truly I tell you
 unless you change and become like children
 you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. ","Whoever becomes humble like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.","Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me.","\u2018If any of you put a stumbling-block before one of these little ones who believe in me
 it would be better for you if a great millstone were fastened around your neck and you were drowned in the depth of the sea. ","Woe to the world because of stumbling-blocks! Occasions for stumbling are bound to come
 but woe to the one by whom the stumbling-block comes!","\u2018If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble
 cut it off and throw it away; it is better for you to enter life maimed or lame than to have two hands or two feet and to be thrown into the eternal fire. ","And if your eye causes you to stumble
 tear it out and throw it away; it is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and to be thrown into the hell of fire.","\u2018Take care that you do not despise one of these little ones; for
 I tell you
 in heaven their angels continually see the face of my Father in heaven. ","What do you think? If a shepherd has a hundred sheep
 and one of them has gone astray
 does he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go in search of the one that went astray? ","And if he finds it
 truly I tell you
 he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that never went astray. ","So it is not the will of your Father in heaven that one of these little ones should be lost.","\u2018If another member of the church sins against you
 go and point out the fault when the two of you are alone. If the member listens to you
 you have regained that one. ","But if you are not listened to
 take one or two others along with you
 so that every word may be confirmed by the evidence of two or three witnesses. ","If the member refuses to listen to them
 tell it to the church; and if the offender refuses to listen even to the church
 let such a one be to you as a Gentile and a tax-collector. ","Truly I tell you
 whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven
 and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven. ","Again
 truly I tell you
 if two of you agree on earth about anything you ask
 it will be done for you by my Father in heaven. ","For where two or three are gathered in my name
 I am there among them.\u2019","Jesus said to him
 \u2018Not seven times
 but
 I tell you
 seventy-seven times.","\u2018For this reason the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his slaves.","When he began the reckoning
 one who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him; ","and
 as he could not pay
 his lord ordered him to be sold
 together with his wife and children and all his possessions
 and payment to be made. ","So the slave fell on his knees before him
 saying
 \u201cHave patience with me
 and I will pay you everything.\u201d ","And out of pity for him
 the lord of that slave released him and forgave him the debt. ","But that same slave
 as he went out
 came upon one of his fellow-slaves who owed him a hundred denarii; and seizing him by the throat
 he said
 \u201cPay what you owe.\u201d ","Then his fellow-slave fell down and pleaded with him
 \u201cHave patience with me
 and I will pay you.\u201d ","But he refused; then he went and threw him into prison until he should pay the debt.","When his fellow-slaves saw what had happened
 they were greatly distressed
 and they went and reported to their lord all that had taken place. ","Then his lord summoned him and said to him
 \u201cYou wicked slave! I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me. ","Should you not have had mercy on your fellow-slave
 as I had mercy on you?\u201d ","And in anger his lord handed him over to be tortured until he should pay his entire debt.","So my heavenly Father will also do to every one of you
 if you do not forgive your brother or sister from your heart.\u2019","He answered
 \u2018Have you not read that the one who made them at the beginning \u201cmade them male and female\u201d
 ","and said
 \u201cFor this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife
 and the two shall become one flesh\u201d? ","So they are no longer two
 but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together
 let no one separate.\u2019 ","He said to them
 \u2018It was because you were so hard-hearted that Moses allowed you to divorce your wives
 but at the beginning it was not so. ","And I say to you
 whoever divorces his wife
 except for unchastity
 and marries another commits adultery.\u2019","But he said to them
 \u2018Not everyone can accept this teaching
 but only those to whom it is given. ","For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth
 and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others
 and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let anyone accept this who can.\u2019","but Jesus said
 \u2018Let the little children come to me
 and do not stop them; for it is to such as these that the kingdom of heaven belongs.\u2019 ","And he said to him
 \u2018Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good. If you wish to enter into life
 keep the commandments.\u2019 ","He said to him
 \u2018Which ones?\u2019 And Jesus said
 \u2018You shall not murder; You shall not commit adultery; You shall not steal; You shall not bear false witness; ","Honour your father and mother; also
 You shall love your neighbour as yourself.\u2019 ","Jesus said to him
 \u2018If you wish to be perfect
 go
 sell your possessions
 and give the money to the poor
 and you will have treasure in heaven; then come
 follow me.\u2019 ","Then Jesus said to his disciples
 \u2018Truly I tell you
 it will be hard for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven. ","Again I tell you
 it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.\u2019 ","But Jesus looked at them and said
 \u2018For mortals it is impossible
 but for God all things are possible.\u2019","Jesus said to them
 \u2018Truly I tell you
 at the renewal of all things
 when the Son of Man is seated on the throne of his glory
 you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones
 judging the twelve tribes of Israel. ","And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields
 for my name\u2019s sake
 will receive a hundredfold
 and will inherit eternal life. ","But many who are first will be last
 and the last will be first.","\u2018For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire labourers for his vineyard.","After agreeing with the labourers for the usual daily wage
 he sent them into his vineyard. ","When he went out about nine o\u2019clock
 he saw others standing idle in the market-place; ","and he said to them
 \u201cYou also go into the vineyard
 and I will pay you whatever is right.\u201d So they went. ","When he went out again about noon and about three o\u2019clock
 he did the same. ","And about five o\u2019clock he went out and found others standing around; and he said to them
 \u201cWhy are you standing here idle all day?\u201d ","They said to him
 \u201cBecause no one has hired us.\u201d He said to them
 \u201cYou also go into the vineyard.\u201d ","When evening came
 the owner of the vineyard said to his manager
 \u201cCall the labourers and give them their pay
 beginning with the last and then going to the first.\u201d ","When those hired about five o\u2019clock came
 each of them received the usual daily wage. ","Now when the first came
 they thought they would receive more; but each of them also received the usual daily wage. ","And when they received it
 they grumbled against the landowner
 ","saying
 \u201cThese last worked only one hour
 and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat.\u201d ","But he replied to one of them
 \u201cFriend
 I am doing you no wrong; did you not agree with me for the usual daily wage? ","Take what belongs to you and go; I choose to give to this last the same as I give to you.","Am I not allowed to do what I choose with what belongs to me? Or are you envious because I am generous?\u201d","So the last will be first
 and the first will be last.\u2019","\u2018See
 we are going up to Jerusalem
 and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and scribes
 and they will condemn him to death; ","then they will hand him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and flogged and crucified; and on the third day he will be raised.\u2019","And he said to her
 \u2018What do you want?\u2019 She said to him
 \u2018Declare that these two sons of mine will sit
 one at your right hand and one at your left
 in your kingdom.\u2019 ","But Jesus answered
 \u2018You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink?\u2019 They said to him
 \u2018We are able.\u2019 ","But Jesus called them to him and said
 \u2018You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them
 and their great ones are tyrants over them. ","It will not be so among you; but whoever wishes to be great among you must be your servant
 ","and whoever wishes to be first among you must be your slave;","just as the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve
 and to give his life a ransom for many.\u2019","Jesus stood still and called them
 saying
 \u2018What do you want me to do for you?\u2019 ","saying to them
 \u2018Go into the village ahead of you
 and immediately you will find a donkey tied
 and a colt with her; untie them and bring them to me. ","If anyone says anything to you
 just say this
 \u201cThe Lord needs them.\u201d And he will send them immediately.\u2019 ","He said to them
 \u2018It is written
 \u201cMy house shall be called a house of prayer\u201d; but you are making it a den of robbers.\u2019","and said to him
 \u2018Do you hear what these are saying?\u2019 Jesus said to them
 \u2018Yes; have you never read
 \u201cOut of the mouths of infants and nursing babies you have prepared praise for yourself\u201d?\u2019","And seeing a fig tree by the side of the road
 he went to it and found nothing at all on it but leaves. Then he said to it
 \u2018May no fruit ever come from you again!\u2019 And the fig tree withered at once. ","Jesus answered them
 \u2018Truly I tell you
 if you have faith and do not doubt
 not only will you do what has been done to the fig tree
 but even if you say to this mountain
 \u201cBe lifted up and thrown into the sea\u201d
 it will be done. ","Whatever you ask for in prayer with faith
 you will receive.\u2019","Jesus said to them
 \u2018I will also ask you one question; if you tell me the answer
 then I will also tell you by what authority I do these things. ","Did the baptism of John come from heaven
 or was it of human origin?\u2019 And they argued with one another
 \u2018If we say
 \u201cFrom heaven\u201d
 he will say to us
 \u201cWhy then did you not believe him?\u201d ","So they answered Jesus
 \u2018We do not know.\u2019 And he said to them
 \u2018Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.","\u2018What do you think? A man had two sons; he went to the first and said
 \u201cSon
 go and work in the vineyard today.\u201d ","He answered
 \u201cI will not\u201d; but later he changed his mind and went. ","The father went to the second and said the same; and he answered
 \u201cI go
 sir\u201d; but he did not go. ","Which of the two did the will of his father?\u2019 They said
 \u2018The first.\u2019 Jesus said to them
 \u2018Truly I tell you
 the tax-collectors and the prostitutes are going into the kingdom of God ahead of you. ","For John came to you in the way of righteousness and you did not believe him
 but the tax-collectors and the prostitutes believed him; and even after you saw it
 you did not change your minds and believe him.","\u2018Listen to another parable. There was a landowner who planted a vineyard
 put a fence around it
 dug a wine press in it
 and built a watch-tower. Then he leased it to tenants and went to another country. ","When the harvest time had come
 he sent his slaves to the tenants to collect his produce. ","But the tenants seized his slaves and beat one
 killed another
 and stoned another. ","Again he sent other slaves
 more than the first; and they treated them in the same way. ","Finally he sent his son to them
 saying
 \u201cThey will respect my son.\u201d ","But when the tenants saw the son
 they said to themselves
 \u201cThis is the heir; come
 let us kill him and get his inheritance.\u201d ","So they seized him
 threw him out of the vineyard
 and killed him. ","Now when the owner of the vineyard comes
 what will he do to those tenants?\u2019 ","They said to him
 \u2018He will put those wretches to a miserable death
 and lease the vineyard to other tenants who will give him the produce at the harvest time.\u2019","Jesus said to them
 \u2018Have you never read in the scriptures: \u201cThe stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; this was the Lord\u2019s doing
 and it is amazing in our eyes\u201d?","Therefore I tell you
 the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people that produces the fruits of the kingdom. ","The one who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; and it will crush anyone on whom it falls.\u2019","\u2018The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who gave a wedding banquet for his son.","He sent his slaves to call those who had been invited to the wedding banquet
 but they would not come. ","Again he sent other slaves
 saying
 \u201cTell those who have been invited: Look
 I have prepared my dinner
 my oxen and my fat calves have been slaughtered
 and everything is ready; come to the wedding banquet.\u201d ","But they made light of it and went away
 one to his farm
 another to his business
 ","while the rest seized his slaves
 maltreated them
 and killed them. ","The king was enraged. He sent his troops
 destroyed those murderers
 and burned their city. ","Then he said to his slaves
 \u201cThe wedding is ready
 but those invited were not worthy. ","Go therefore into the main streets
 and invite everyone you find to the wedding banquet.\u201d ","Those slaves went out into the streets and gathered all whom they found
 both good and bad; so the wedding hall was filled with guests.","\u2018But when the king came in to see the guests
 he noticed a man there who was not wearing a wedding robe
 ","and he said to him
 \u201cFriend
 how did you get in here without a wedding robe?\u201d And he was speechless. ","Then the king said to the attendants
 \u201cBind him hand and foot
 and throw him into the outer darkness
 where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\u201d ","For many are called
 but few are chosen.\u2019","But Jesus
 aware of their malice
 said
 \u2018Why are you putting me to the test
 you hypocrites? ","Show me the coin used for the tax.\u2019 And they brought him a denarius.","Then he said to them
 \u2018Whose head is this
 and whose title?\u2019 ","They answered
 \u2018The emperor\u2019s.\u2019 Then he said to them
 \u2018Give therefore to the emperor the things that are the emperor\u2019s

 \u2018You are wrong
 because you know neither the scriptures nor the power of God. ","For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage
 but are like angels in heaven. ","And as for the resurrection of the dead
 have you not read what was said to you by God
 ","\u201cI am the God of Abraham
 the God of Isaac

 but of the living.\u2019 ","He said to him
 \u2018\u201cYou shall love the Lord your God with all your heart

 \u2018How is it then that David by the Spirit calls him Lord
 saying
","\u201cThe Lord said to my Lord
 \u2018Sit at my right hand

 how can he be his son?\u2019 ","\u2018The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses\u2019 seat;","therefore
 do whatever they teach you and follow it; but do not do as they do
 for they do not practise what they teach. ","They tie up heavy burdens
 hard to bear
 and lay them on the shoulders of others; but they themselves are unwilling to lift a finger to move them. ","They do all their deeds to be seen by others; for they make their phylacteries broad and their fringes long.","They love to have the place of honour at banquets and the best seats in the synagogues
 ","and to be greeted with respect in the market-places

 the Messiah. ","The greatest among you will be your servant.","All who exalt themselves will be humbled
 and all who humble themselves will be exalted.","\u2018But woe to you
 scribes and Pharisees
 hypocrites! For you lock people out of the kingdom of heaven. For you do not go in yourselves

 you stop them. ","Woe to you
 scribes and Pharisees
 hypocrites! For you cross sea and land to make a single convert
 and you make the new convert twice as much a child of hell as yourselves.","\u2018Woe to you
 blind guides

 the gold or the sanctuary that has made the gold sacred? ","And you say
 \u201cWhoever swears by the altar is bound by nothing

 swears by the throne of God and by the one who is seated upon it.","\u2018Woe to you
 scribes and Pharisees
 hypocrites! For you tithe mint
 dill

 desolate. ","For I tell you
 you will not see me again until you say

 \u2018You see all these
 do you not? Truly I tell you
 not one stone will be left here upon another; all will be thrown down.\u2019","Jesus answered them
 \u2018Beware that no one leads you astray. ","For many will come in my name
 saying
 \u201cI am the Messiah!\u201d and they will lead many astray. ","And you will hear of wars and rumours of wars; see that you are not alarmed; for this must take place

 the love of many will grow cold. ","But anyone who endures to the end will be saved.","And this good news of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the world
 as a testimony to all the nations; and then the end will come.","\u2018So when you see the desolating sacrilege standing in the holy place
 as was spoken of by the prophet Daniel (let the reader understand)
 ","then those in Judea must flee to the mountains;","someone on the housetop must not go down to take what is in the house;","someone in the field must not turn back to get a coat.","Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing infants in those days!","Pray that your flight may not be in winter or on a sabbath.","For at that time there will be great suffering
 such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now
 no
 and never will be. ","And if those days had not been cut short
 no one would be saved; but for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short. ","Then if anyone says to you
 \u201cLook! Here is the Messiah!\u201d or \u201cThere he is!\u201d\u2014do not believe it. ","For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and produce great signs and omens
 to lead astray
 if possible
 even the elect. ","Take note
 I have told you beforehand. ","So
 if they say to you
 \u201cLook! He is in the wilderness\u201d
 do not go out. If they say
 \u201cLook! He is in the inner rooms\u201d
 do not believe it. ","For as the lightning comes from the east and flashes as far as the west
 so will be the coming of the Son of Man. ","Wherever the corpse is
 there the vultures will gather.","\u2018Immediately after the suffering of those days the sun will be darkened
 and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from heaven
 and the powers of heaven will be shaken.","Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven
 and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn
 and they will see \u201cthe Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven\u201d with power and great glory. ","And he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call
 and they will gather his elect from the four winds
 from one end of heaven to the other.","\u2018From the fig tree learn its lesson: as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts forth its leaves
 you know that summer is near. ","So also
 when you see all these things
 you know that he is near
 at the very gates. ","Truly I tell you
 this generation will not pass away until all these things have taken place. ","Heaven and earth will pass away
 but my words will not pass away.","\u2018But about that day and hour no one knows
 neither the angels of heaven
 nor the Son
 but only the Father. ","For as the days of Noah were
 so will be the coming of the Son of Man. ","For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking
 marrying and giving in marriage
 until the day Noah entered the ark
 ","and they knew nothing until the flood came and swept them all away
 so too will be the coming of the Son of Man. ","Then two will be in the field; one will be taken and one will be left.","Two women will be grinding meal together; one will be taken and one will be left.","Keep awake therefore
 for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming. ","But understand this: if the owner of the house had known in what part of the night the thief was coming
 he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken into. ","Therefore you also must be ready
 for the Son of Man is coming at an unexpected hour.","\u2018Who then is the faithful and wise slave
 whom his master has put in charge of his household
 to give the other slaves their allowance of food at the proper time? ","Blessed is that slave whom his master will find at work when he arrives.","Truly I tell you
 he will put that one in charge of all his possessions. ","But if that wicked slave says to himself
 \u201cMy master is delayed\u201d
 ","and he begins to beat his fellow-slaves
 and eats and drinks with drunkards
 ","the master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour that he does not know.","He will cut him in pieces and put him with the hypocrites
 where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.","\u2018Then the kingdom of heaven will be like this. Ten bridesmaids took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom.","Five of them were foolish
 and five were wise. ","When the foolish took their lamps
 they took no oil with them; ","but the wise took flasks of oil with their lamps.","As the bridegroom was delayed
 all of them became drowsy and slept. ","But at midnight there was a shout
 \u201cLook! Here is the bridegroom! Come out to meet him.\u201d ","Then all those bridesmaids got up and trimmed their lamps.","The foolish said to the wise
 \u201cGive us some of your oil
 for our lamps are going out.\u201d ","But the wise replied
 \u201cNo! there will not be enough for you and for us; you had better go to the dealers and buy some for yourselves.\u201d ","And while they went to buy it
 the bridegroom came
 and those who were ready went with him into the wedding banquet; and the door was shut. ","Later the other bridesmaids came also
 saying
 \u201cLord
 lord
 open to us.\u201d ","But he replied
 \u201cTruly I tell you
 I do not know you.\u201d ","Keep awake therefore
 for you know neither the day nor the hour.","\u2018For it is as if a man
 going on a journey
 summoned his slaves and entrusted his property to them; ","to one he gave five talents
 to another two
 to another one
 to each according to his ability. Then he went away. ","The one who had received the five talents went off at once and traded with them
 and made five more talents. ","In the same way
 the one who had the two talents made two more talents. ","But the one who had received the one talent went off and dug a hole in the ground and hid his master\u2019s money.","After a long time the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them.","Then the one who had received the five talents came forward
 bringing five more talents
 saying
 \u201cMaster
 you handed over to me five talents; see
 I have made five more talents.\u201d ","His master said to him
 \u201cWell done
 good and trustworthy slave; you have been trustworthy in a few things
 I will put you in charge of many things; enter into the joy of your master.\u201d ","And the one with the two talents also came forward
 saying
 \u201cMaster
 you handed over to me two talents; see
 I have made two more talents.\u201d ","His master said to him
 \u201cWell done
 good and trustworthy slave; you have been trustworthy in a few things

 saying
 \u201cMaster
 I knew that you were a harsh man
 reaping where you did not sow
 and gathering where you did not scatter seed; ","so I was afraid
 and I went and hid your talent in the ground. Here you have what is yours.\u201d ","But his master replied
 \u201cYou wicked and lazy slave! You knew
 did you
 that I reap where I did not sow
 and gather where I did not scatter? ","Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers
 and on my return I would have received what was my own with interest. ","So take the talent from him
 and give it to the one with the ten talents. ","For to all those who have
 more will be given
 and they will have an abundance; but from those who have nothing
 even what they have will be taken away. ","As for this worthless slave
 throw him into the outer darkness
 where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\u201d","\u2018When the Son of Man comes in his glory
 and all the angels with him
 then he will sit on the throne of his glory. ","All the nations will be gathered before him
 and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats
 ","and he will put the sheep at his right hand and the goats at the left.","Then the king will say to those at his right hand

 for they will see God.","\u201cBlessed are the peacemakers
 for they will be called children of God.","\u201cBlessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness\u2019 sake
 for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.","\u201cBlessed are you when people revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account.","Rejoice and be glad
 for your reward is great in heaven
 for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.","\u201cYou are the salt of the earth; but if salt has lost its taste
 how can its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything
 but is thrown out and trampled under foot.","\u201cYou are the light of the world. A city built on a hill cannot be hid.","No one after lighting a lamp puts it under the bushel basket
 but on the lampstand
 and it gives light to all in the house. ","In the same way
 let your light shine before others
 so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father in heaven.","\u201cDo not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets; I have come not to abolish but to fulfill.","For truly I tell you
 until heaven and earth pass away
 not one letter
 not one stroke of a letter
 will pass from the law until all is accomplished. ","Therefore
 whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments
 and teaches others to do the same
 will be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. ","For I tell you
 unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees
 you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.","\u201cYou have heard that it was said to those of ancient times
 \u2018You shall not murder\u2019; and \u2018whoever murders shall be liable to judgment.\u2019 ","But I say to you that if you are angry with a brother or sister
 you will be liable to judgment; and if you insult a brother or sister
 you will be liable to the council; and if you say
 \u2018You fool
\u2019 you will be liable to the hell of fire. ","So when you are offering your gift at the altar
 if you remember that your brother or sister has something against you
 ","leave your gift there before the altar and go; first be reconciled to your brother or sister
 and then come and offer your gift. ","Come to terms quickly with your accuser while you are on the way to court with him
 or your accuser may hand you over to the judge
 and the judge to the guard
 and you will be thrown into prison. ","Truly I tell you
 you will never get out until you have paid the last penny.","\u201cYou have heard that it was said
 \u2018You shall not commit adultery.\u2019 ","But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her in his heart.","If your right eye causes you to sin
 tear it out and throw it away; it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. ","And if your right hand causes you to sin
 cut it off and throw it away; it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to go into hell.","\u201cIt was also said
 \u2018Whoever divorces his wife
 let him give her a certificate of divorce.\u2019 ","But I say to you that anyone who divorces his wife
 except on the ground of unchastity
 causes her to commit adultery; and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.","\u201cAgain
 you have heard that it was said to those of ancient times
 \u2018You shall not swear falsely
 but carry out the vows you have made to the Lord.\u2019 ","But I say to you
 Do not swear at all
 either by heaven
 for it is the throne of God
 ","or by the earth
 for it is his footstool
 or by Jerusalem
 for it is the city of the great King. ","And do not swear by your head
 for you cannot make one hair white or black. ","Let your word be \u2018Yes
 Yes\u2019 or \u2018No
 No\u2019; anything more than this comes from the evil one.","\u201cYou have heard that it was said
 \u2018An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.\u2019 ","But I say to you
 Do not resist an evildoer. But if anyone strikes you on the right cheek
 turn the other also; ","and if anyone wants to sue you and take your coat
 give your cloak as well; ","and if anyone forces you to go one mile
 go also the second mile. ","Give to everyone who begs from you
 and do not refuse anyone who wants to borrow from you.","\u201cYou have heard that it was said
 \u2018You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.\u2019 ","But I say to you
 Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you
 ","so that you may be children of your Father in heaven; for he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good
 and sends rain on the righteous and on the unrighteous. ","For if you love those who love you
 what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? ","And if you greet only your brothers and sisters
 what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same? ","Be perfect
 therefore
 as your heavenly Father is perfect.","\u201cBeware of practicing your piety before others in order to be seen by them; for then you have no reward from your Father in heaven.","\u201cSo whenever you give alms
 do not sound a trumpet before you
 as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets
 so that they may be praised by others. Truly I tell you
 they have received their reward. ","But when you give alms
 do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing
 ","so that your alms may be done in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.","\u201cAnd whenever you pray
 do not be like the hypocrites; for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners
 so that they may be seen by others. Truly I tell you
 they have received their reward. ","But whenever you pray
 go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.","\u201cWhen you are praying
 do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do; for they think that they will be heard because of their many words. ","Do not be like them
 for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.","\u201cPray then in this way: Our Father in heaven
 hallowed be your name.","    Your kingdom come. Your will be done
 on earth as it is in heaven.","Give us this day our daily bread.","    And forgive us our debts
 as we also have forgiven our debtors.","    And do not bring us to the time of trial
 but rescue us from the evil one.","For if you forgive others their trespasses
 your heavenly Father will also forgive you; ","but if you do not forgive others
 neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.","\u201cAnd whenever you fast
 do not look dismal
 like the hypocrites
 for they disfigure their faces so as to show others that they are fasting. Truly I tell you
 they have received their reward. ","But when you fast
 put oil on your head and wash your face
 ","so that your fasting may be seen not by others but by your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.","\u201cDo not store up for yourselves treasures on earth
 where moth and rust consume and where thieves break in and steal; ","but store up for yourselves treasures in heaven
 where neither moth nor rust consumes and where thieves do not break in and steal. ","For where your treasure is
 there your heart will be also.","\u201cThe eye is the lamp of the body. So
 if your eye is healthy
 your whole body will be full of light; ","but if your eye is unhealthy
 your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light in you is darkness
 how great is the darkness!","\u201cNo one can serve two masters; for a slave will either hate the one and love the other
 or be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth.","\u201cTherefore I tell you
 do not worry about your life
 what you will eat or what you will drink
 or about your body
 what you will wear. Is not life more than food
 and the body more than clothing? ","Look at the birds of the air; they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns
 and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? ","And can any of you by worrying add a single hour to your span of life?","And why do you worry about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field
 how they grow; they neither toil nor spin
 ","yet I tell you
 even Solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these. ","But if God so clothes the grass of the field
 which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven
 will he not much more clothe you\u2014you of little faith? ","Therefore do not worry
 saying
 \u2018What will we eat?\u2019 or \u2018What will we drink?\u2019 or \u2018What will we wear?\u2019 ","For it is the Gentiles who strive for all these things; and indeed your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.","But strive first for the kingdom of God and his righteousness
 and all these things will be given to you as well.","\u201cSo do not worry about tomorrow
 for tomorrow will bring worries of its own. Today\u2019s trouble is enough for today.","\u201cDo not judge
 so that you may not be judged. ","For with the judgment you make you will be judged
 and the measure you give will be the measure you get. ","Why do you see the speck in your neighbor\u2019s eye
 but do not notice the log in your own eye? ","Or how can you say to your neighbor
 \u2018Let me take the speck out of your eye
\u2019 while the log is in your own eye? ","You hypocrite
 first take the log out of your own eye
 and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your neighbor\u2019s eye.","\u201cDo not give what is holy to dogs; and do not throw your pearls before swine
 or they will trample them under foot and turn and maul you.","\u201cAsk
 and it will be given you; search
 and you will find; knock
 and the door will be opened for you. ","For everyone who asks receives
 and everyone who searches finds
 and for everyone who knocks
 the door will be opened. ","Is there anyone among you who
 if your child asks for bread
 will give a stone? ","Or if the child asks for a fish
 will give a snake? ","If you then
 who are evil
 know how to give good gifts to your children
 how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask him!","\u201cIn everything do to others as you would have them do to you; for this is the law and the prophets.","\u201cEnter through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the road is easy that leads to destruction
 and there are many who take it. ","For the gate is narrow and the road is hard that leads to life
 and there are few who find it.","\u201cBeware of false prophets
 who come to you in sheep\u2019s clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves. ","You will know them by their fruits. Are grapes gathered from thorns
 or figs from thistles? ","In the same way
 every good tree bears good fruit
 but the bad tree bears bad fruit. ","A good tree cannot bear bad fruit
 nor can a bad tree bear good fruit. ","Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.","Thus you will know them by their fruits.","\u201cNot everyone who says to me
 \u2018Lord
 Lord

 but only the one who does the will of my Father in heaven. ","On that day many will say to me
 \u2018Lord
 Lord

 and cast out demons in your name
 and do many deeds of power in your name?\u2019 ","Then I will declare to them
 \u2018I never knew you; go away from me
 you evildoers.\u2019","\u201cEveryone then who hears these words of mine and acts on them will be like a wise man who built his house on rock.","The rain fell
 the floods came

 and the floods came
 and the winds blew and beat against that house
 and it fell\u2014and great was its fall!\u201d","He stretched out his hand and touched him
 saying
 \u201cI do choose. Be made clean!\u201d Immediately his leprosy was cleansed. ","Then Jesus said to him
 \u201cSee that you say nothing to anyone; but go
 show yourself to the priest

 as a testimony to them.\u201d","And he said to him
 \u201cI will come and cure him.\u201d ","When Jesus heard him
 he was amazed and said to those who followed him
 \u201cTruly I tell you
 in no one in Israel have I found such faith. ","I tell you
 many will come from east and west and will eat with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven
 ","while the heirs of the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness
 where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\u201d ","And to the centurion Jesus said
 \u201cGo; let it be done for you according to your faith.\u201d And the servant was healed in that hour.","And Jesus said to him
 \u201cFoxes have holes
 and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.\u201d ","But Jesus said to him
 \u201cFollow me
 and let the dead bury their own dead.\u201d","And he said to them
 \u201cWhy are you afraid
 you of little faith?\u201d Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a dead calm. ","And he said to them
 \u201cGo!\u201d So they came out and entered the swine; and suddenly
 the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea and perished in the water. ","And just then some people were carrying a paralyzed man lying on a bed. When Jesus saw their faith
 he said to the paralytic
 \u201cTake heart
 son; your sins are forgiven.\u201d ","But Jesus
 perceiving their thoughts
 said
 \u201cWhy do you think evil in your hearts? ","For which is easier
 to say
 \u2018Your sins are forgiven
\u2019 or to say
 \u2018Stand up and walk\u2019? ","But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins\u201d\u2014he then said to the paralytic\u2014\u201cStand up
 take your bed and go to your home.\u201d ","As Jesus was walking along
 he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax booth; and he said to him
 \u201cFollow me.\u201d And he got up and followed him.","But when he heard this
 he said
 \u201cThose who are well have no need of a physician
 but those who are sick. ","Go and learn what this means
 \u2018I desire mercy
 not sacrifice.\u2019 For I have come to call not the righteous but sinners.\u201d","And Jesus said to them
 \u201cThe wedding guests cannot mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them
 can they? The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them
 and then they will fast. ","No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old cloak
 for the patch pulls away from the cloak
 and a worse tear is made. ","Neither is new wine put into old wineskins; otherwise
 the skins burst
 and the wine is spilled
 and the skins are destroyed; but new wine is put into fresh wineskins

 and seeing her he said
 \u201cTake heart

 \u201cGo away; for the girl is not dead but sleeping.\u201d And they laughed at him. ","When he entered the house
 the blind men came to him; and Jesus said to them

 \u201cYes
 Lord.\u201d ","And their eyes were opened. Then Jesus sternly ordered them
 \u201cSee that no one knows of this.\u201d ","Then he said to his disciples
 \u201cThe harvest is plentiful
 but the laborers are few; ","therefore ask the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest.\u201d","These twelve Jesus sent out with the following instructions: \u201cGo nowhere among the Gentiles

 raise the dead
 cleanse the lepers
 cast out demons. You received without payment; give without payment. ","Take no gold
 or silver
 or copper in your belts
 ","no bag for your journey
 or two tunics
 or sandals

 find out who in it is worthy
 and stay there until you leave. ","As you enter the house
 greet it. ","If the house is worthy
 let your peace come upon it; but if it is not worthy
 let your peace return to you. ","If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words
 shake off the dust from your feet as you leave that house or town. ","Truly I tell you
 it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town.","\u201cSee
 I am sending you out like sheep into the midst of wolves; so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves. ","Beware of them
 for they will hand you over to councils and flog you in their synagogues; ","and you will be dragged before governors and kings because of me
 as a testimony to them and the Gentiles. ","When they hand you over
 do not worry about how you are to speak or what you are to say; for what you are to say will be given to you at that time; ","for it is not you who speak
 but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you. ","Brother will betray brother to death

 flee to the next; for truly I tell you
 you will not have gone through all the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.","\u201cA disciple is not above the teacher

 I also will acknowledge before my Father in heaven; ","but whoever denies me before others

 but a sword.","For I have come to set a man against his father
 and a daughter against her mother
 and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law;","and one\u2019s foes will be members of one\u2019s own household.","Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me;","and whoever does not take up the cross and follow me is not worthy of me.","Those who find their life will lose it
 and those who lose their life for my sake will find it.","\u201cWhoever welcomes you welcomes me

 Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: \u201cWhat did you go out into the wilderness to look at? A reed shaken by the wind? ","What then did you go out to see? Someone dressed in soft robes? Look

 I am sending my messenger ahead of you

 among those born of women no one has arisen greater than John the Baptist; yet the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. ","From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has suffered violence

 and they say
 \u2018He has a demon\u2019; ","the Son of Man came eating and drinking
 and they say
 \u2018Look
 a glutton and a drunkard

 because they did not repent. ","\u201cWoe to you
 Chorazin! Woe to you
 Bethsaida! For if the deeds of power done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon
 they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. ","But I tell you

 Capernaum
 will you be exalted to heaven? No
 you will be brought down to Hades. For if the deeds of power done in you had been done in Sodom
 it would have remained until this day. ","But I tell you that on the day of judgment it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom than for you.\u201d","At that time Jesus said

 something greater than the temple is here. ","But if you had known what this means

 \u201cStretch out your hand.\u201d He stretched it out

 some seeds fell on the path
 and the birds came and ate them up. ","Other seeds fell on rocky ground
 where they did not have much soil
 and they sprang up quickly
 since they had no depth of soil. ","But when the sun rose
 they were scorched; and since they had no root
 they withered away. ","Other seeds fell among thorns

 some a hundredfold
 some sixty
 some thirty. ","Let anyone with ears listen!\u201d","He answered
 \u201cTo you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven

 more will be given
 and they will have an abundance; but from those who have nothing
 even what they have will be taken away. ","The reason I speak to them in parables is that \u2018seeing they do not perceive
 and hearing they do not listen
 nor do they understand.\u2019 ","With them indeed is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah that says: \u2018You will indeed listen
 but never understand
 and you will indeed look
 but never perceive.","For this people\u2019s heart has grown dull
 and their ears are hard of hearing
 and they have shut their eyes; so that they might not look with their eyes

 for they see
 and your ears
 for they hear. ","Truly I tell you
 many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see
 but did not see it
 and to hear what you hear
 but did not hear it.","\u201cHear then the parable of the sower.","When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it
 the evil one comes and snatches away what is sown in the heart; this is what was sown on the path. ","As for what was sown on rocky ground
 this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy; ","yet such a person has no root
 but endures only for a while
 and when trouble or persecution arises on account of the word
 that person immediately falls away. ","As for what was sown among thorns
 this is the one who hears the word
 but the cares of the world and the lure of wealth choke the word
 and it yields nothing. ","But as for what was sown on good soil
 this is the one who hears the word and understands it
 who indeed bears fruit and yields
 in one case a hundredfold
 in another sixty
 and in another thirty.\u201d","He put before them another parable: \u201cThe kingdom of heaven may be compared to someone who sowed good seed in his field;","but while everybody was asleep
 an enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat
 and then went away. ","So when the plants came up and bore grain
 then the weeds appeared as well. ","And the slaves of the householder came and said to him
 \u2018Master
 did you not sow good seed in your field? Where
 then
 did these weeds come from?\u2019 ","He answered
 \u2018An enemy has done this.\u2019 The slaves said to him
 \u2018Then do you want us to go and gather them?\u2019 ","But he replied
 \u2018No; for in gathering the weeds you would uproot the wheat along with them. ","Let both of them grow together until the harvest; and at harvest time I will tell the reapers
 Collect the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned
 but gather the wheat into my barn.\u2019\u201d","He put before them another parable: \u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that someone took and sowed in his field;","it is the smallest of all the seeds
 but when it has grown it is the greatest of shrubs and becomes a tree
 so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches.\u201d","He told them another parable: \u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed in with three measures of flour until all of it was leavened.\u201d","He answered
 \u201cThe one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man; ","the field is the world
 and the good seed are the children of the kingdom; the weeds are the children of the evil one
 ","and the enemy who sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the age
 and the reapers are angels. ","Just as the weeds are collected and burned up with fire
 so will it be at the end of the age. ","The Son of Man will send his angels
 and they will collect out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all evildoers
 ","and they will throw them into the furnace of fire
 where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. ","Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Let anyone with ears listen!","\u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field
 which someone found and hid; then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.","\u201cAgain
 the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls; ","on finding one pearl of great value
 he went and sold all that he had and bought it.","\u201cAgain
 the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea and caught fish of every kind; ","when it was full
 they drew it ashore
 sat down
 and put the good into baskets but threw out the bad. ","So it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come out and separate the evil from the righteous","and throw them into the furnace of fire
 where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.","\u201cHave you understood all this?\u201d They answered
 \u201cYes.\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cTherefore every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a household who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old.\u201d ","And they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them
 \u201cProphets are not without honor except in their own country and in their own house.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cThey need not go away; you give them something to eat.\u201d ","And he said
 \u201cBring them here to me.\u201d ","But immediately Jesus spoke to them and said
 \u201cTake heart
 it is I; do not be afraid.\u201d","He said
 \u201cCome.\u201d So Peter got out of the boat
 started walking on the water
 and came toward Jesus. ","Jesus immediately reached out his hand and caught him
 saying to him
 \u201cYou of little faith
 why did you doubt?\u201d ","He answered them
 \u201cAnd why do you break the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition? ","For God said
 \u2018Honor your father and your mother
\u2019 and
 \u2018Whoever speaks evil of father or mother must surely die.\u2019 ","But you say that whoever tells father or mother
 \u2018Whatever support you might have had from me is given to God
\u2019 then that person need not honor the father. ","So
 for the sake of your tradition
 you make void the word of God. ","You hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied rightly about you when he said:","\u2018This people honors me with their lips
 but their hearts are far from me;","in vain do they worship me
 teaching human precepts as doctrines.\u2019\u201d","Then he called the crowd to him and said to them
 \u201cListen and understand: ","it is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person
 but it is what comes out of the mouth that defiles.\u201d ","He answered
 \u201cEvery plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted. ","Let them alone; they are blind guides of the blind. And if one blind person guides another
 both will fall into a pit.\u201d ","Then he said
 \u201cAre you also still without understanding? ","Do you not see that whatever goes into the mouth enters the stomach
 and goes out into the sewer? ","But what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart
 and this is what defiles. ","For out of the heart come evil intentions
 murder
 adultery
 fornication
 theft
 false witness
 slander. ","These are what defile a person
 but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile.\u201d","He answered
 \u201cI was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\u201d ","He answered
 \u201cIt is not fair to take the children\u2019s food and throw it to the dogs.\u201d ","Then Jesus answered her
 \u201cWoman
 great is your faith! Let it be done for you as you wish.\u201d And her daughter was healed instantly.","Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said
 \u201cI have compassion for the crowd
 because they have been with me now for three days and have nothing to eat; and I do not want to send them away hungry
 for they might faint on the way.\u201d ","Jesus asked them
 \u201cHow many loaves have you?\u201d They said
 \u201cSeven
 and a few small fish.\u201d ","He answered them
 \u201cWhen it is evening
 you say
 \u2018It will be fair weather
 for the sky is red.\u2019 ","And in the morning
 \u2018It will be stormy today
 for the sky is red and threatening.\u2019 You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky
 but you cannot interpret the signs of the times. ","An evil and adulterous generation asks for a sign
 but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah.\u201d Then he left them and went away.","Jesus said to them
 \u201cWatch out
 and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\u201d ","And becoming aware of it
 Jesus said
 \u201cYou of little faith
 why are you talking about having no bread? ","Do you still not perceive? Do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand
 and how many baskets you gathered? ","Or the seven loaves for the four thousand
 and how many baskets you gathered? ","How could you fail to perceive that I was not speaking about bread? Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees!\u201d","Now when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi
 he asked his disciples
 \u201cWho do people say that the Son of Man is?\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cBut who do you say that I am?\u201d ","And Jesus answered him
 \u201cBlessed are you
 Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you
 but my Father in heaven. ","And I tell you
 you are Peter
 and on this rock I will build my church
 and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it. ","I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven
 and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven
 and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.\u201d ","But he turned and said to Peter
 \u201cGet behind me
 Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are setting your mind not on divine things but on human things.\u201d","Then Jesus told his disciples
 \u201cIf any want to become my followers
 let them deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me. ","For those who want to save their life will lose it
 and those who lose their life for my sake will find it. ","For what will it profit them if they gain the whole world but forfeit their life? Or what will they give in return for their life?","\u201cFor the Son of Man is to come with his angels in the glory of his Father
 and then he will repay everyone for what has been done. ","Truly I tell you
 there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.\u201d","But Jesus came and touched them
 saying
 \u201cGet up and do not be afraid.\u201d ","As they were coming down the mountain
 Jesus ordered them
 \u201cTell no one about the vision until after the Son of Man has been raised from the dead.\u201d ","He replied
 \u201cElijah is indeed coming and will restore all things; ","but I tell you that Elijah has already come
 and they did not recognize him
 but they did to him whatever they pleased. So also the Son of Man is about to suffer at their hands.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cYou faithless and perverse generation
 how much longer must I be with you? How much longer must I put up with you? Bring him here to me.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cBecause of your little faith. For truly I tell you
 if you have faith the size of a mustard seed
 you will say to this mountain
 \u2018Move from here to there
\u2019 and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you.\u201d","As they were gathering in Galilee
 Jesus said to them
 \u201cThe Son of Man is going to be betrayed into human hands
 ","and they will kill him
 and on the third day he will be raised.\u201d And they were greatly distressed.","He said
 \u201cYes
 he does.\u201d And when he came home
 Jesus spoke of it first
 asking
 \u201cWhat do you think
 Simon? From whom do kings of the earth take toll or tribute? From their children or from others?\u201d ","When Peter said
 \u201cFrom others
\u201d Jesus said to him
 \u201cThen the children are free. ","However
 so that we do not give offense to them
 go to the sea and cast a hook; take the first fish that comes up; and when you open its mouth
 you will find a coin; take that and give it to them for you and me.\u201d","and said
 \u201cTruly I tell you
 unless you change and become like children
 you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. ","Whoever becomes humble like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.","Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me.","\u201cIf any of you put a stumbling block before one of these little ones who believe in me
 it would be better for you if a great millstone were fastened around your neck and you were drowned in the depth of the sea. ","Woe to the world because of stumbling blocks! Occasions for stumbling are bound to come
 but woe to the one by whom the stumbling block comes!","\u201cIf your hand or your foot causes you to stumble
 cut it off and throw it away; it is better for you to enter life maimed or lame than to have two hands or two feet and to be thrown into the eternal fire. ","And if your eye causes you to stumble
 tear it out and throw it away; it is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and to be thrown into the hell of fire.","\u201cTake care that you do not despise one of these little ones; for
 I tell you
 in heaven their angels continually see the face of my Father in heaven. ","What do you think? If a shepherd has a hundred sheep
 and one of them has gone astray
 does he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go in search of the one that went astray? ","And if he finds it
 truly I tell you
 he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that never went astray. ","So it is not the will of your Father in heaven that one of these little ones should be lost.","\u201cIf another member of the church sins against you
 go and point out the fault when the two of you are alone. If the member listens to you
 you have regained that one. ","But if you are not listened to
 take one or two others along with you
 so that every word may be confirmed by the evidence of two or three witnesses. ","If the member refuses to listen to them
 tell it to the church; and if the offender refuses to listen even to the church
 let such a one be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector. ","Truly I tell you
 whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven
 and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven. ","Again
 truly I tell you
 if two of you agree on earth about anything you ask
 it will be done for you by my Father in heaven. ","For where two or three are gathered in my name
 I am there among them.\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cNot seven times
 but
 I tell you
 seventy-seven times.","\u201cFor this reason the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his slaves.","When he began the reckoning
 one who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him; ","and
 as he could not pay
 his lord ordered him to be sold
 together with his wife and children and all his possessions
 and payment to be made. ","So the slave fell on his knees before him
 saying
 \u2018Have patience with me
 and I will pay you everything.\u2019 ","And out of pity for him
 the lord of that slave released him and forgave him the debt. ","But that same slave
 as he went out
 came upon one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii; and seizing him by the throat
 he said
 \u2018Pay what you owe.\u2019 ","Then his fellow slave fell down and pleaded with him
 \u2018Have patience with me
 and I will pay you.\u2019 ","But he refused; then he went and threw him into prison until he would pay the debt.","When his fellow slaves saw what had happened
 they were greatly distressed
 and they went and reported to their lord all that had taken place. ","Then his lord summoned him and said to him
 \u2018You wicked slave! I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me. ","Should you not have had mercy on your fellow slave
 as I had mercy on you?\u2019 ","And in anger his lord handed him over to be tortured until he would pay his entire debt.","So my heavenly Father will also do to every one of you
 if you do not forgive your brother or sister from your heart.\u201d","He answered
 \u201cHave you not read that the one who made them at the beginning \u2018made them male and female
\u2019 ","and said
 \u2018For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife
 and the two shall become one flesh\u2019? ","So they are no longer two
 but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together
 let no one separate.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cIt was because you were so hard-hearted that Moses allowed you to divorce your wives
 but from the beginning it was not so. ","And I say to you
 whoever divorces his wife
 except for unchastity
 and marries another commits adultery.\u201d","But he said to them
 \u201cNot everyone can accept this teaching
 but only those to whom it is given. ","For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth
 and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others
 and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let anyone accept this who can.\u201d","but Jesus said
 \u201cLet the little children come to me
 and do not stop them; for it is to such as these that the kingdom of heaven belongs.\u201d ","And he said to him
 \u201cWhy do you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good. If you wish to enter into life
 keep the commandments.\u201d ","He said to him
 \u201cWhich ones?\u201d And Jesus said
 \u201cYou shall not murder; You shall not commit adultery; You shall not steal; You shall not bear false witness; ","Honor your father and mother; also
 You shall love your neighbor as yourself.\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cIf you wish to be perfect
 go
 sell your possessions
 and give the money to the poor
 and you will have treasure in heaven; then come
 follow me.\u201d ","Then Jesus said to his disciples
 \u201cTruly I tell you
 it will be hard for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven. ","Again I tell you
 it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.\u201d ","But Jesus looked at them and said
 \u201cFor mortals it is impossible
 but for God all things are possible.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cTruly I tell you
 at the renewal of all things
 when the Son of Man is seated on the throne of his glory
 you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones
 judging the twelve tribes of Israel. ","And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields
 for my name\u2019s sake
 will receive a hundredfold
 and will inherit eternal life. ","But many who are first will be last
 and the last will be first.","\u201cFor the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.","After agreeing with the laborers for the usual daily wage
 he sent them into his vineyard. ","When he went out about nine o\u2019clock
 he saw others standing idle in the marketplace; ","and he said to them
 \u2018You also go into the vineyard
 and I will pay you whatever is right.\u2019 So they went. ","When he went out again about noon and about three o\u2019clock
 he did the same. ","And about five o\u2019clock he went out and found others standing around; and he said to them
 \u2018Why are you standing here idle all day?\u2019 ","They said to him
 \u2018Because no one has hired us.\u2019 He said to them
 \u2018You also go into the vineyard.\u2019 ","When evening came
 the owner of the vineyard said to his manager
 \u2018Call the laborers and give them their pay
 beginning with the last and then going to the first.\u2019 ","When those hired about five o\u2019clock came
 each of them received the usual daily wage. ","Now when the first came
 they thought they would receive more; but each of them also received the usual daily wage. ","And when they received it
 they grumbled against the landowner
 ","saying
 \u2018These last worked only one hour
 and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat.\u2019 ","But he replied to one of them
 \u2018Friend
 I am doing you no wrong; did you not agree with me for the usual daily wage? ","Take what belongs to you and go; I choose to give to this last the same as I give to you.","Am I not allowed to do what I choose with what belongs to me? Or are you envious because I am generous?\u2019","So the last will be first
 and the first will be last.\u201d","\u201cSee
 we are going up to Jerusalem
 and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and scribes
 and they will condemn him to death; ","then they will hand him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and flogged and crucified; and on the third day he will be raised.\u201d","And he said to her
 \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d She said to him
 \u201cDeclare that these two sons of mine will sit
 one at your right hand and one at your left
 in your kingdom.\u201d ","But Jesus answered
 \u201cYou do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink?\u201d They said to him
 \u201cWe are able.\u201d ","But Jesus called them to him and said
 \u201cYou know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them
 and their great ones are tyrants over them. ","It will not be so among you; but whoever wishes to be great among you must be your servant
 ","and whoever wishes to be first among you must be your slave;","just as the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve
 and to give his life a ransom for many.\u201d","Jesus stood still and called them
 saying
 \u201cWhat do you want me to do for you?\u201d ","saying to them
 \u201cGo into the village ahead of you
 and immediately you will find a donkey tied
 and a colt with her; untie them and bring them to me. ","If anyone says anything to you
 just say this
 \u2018The Lord needs them.\u2019 And he will send them immediately.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cIt is written
 \u2018My house shall be called a house of prayer\u2019; but you are making it a den of robbers.\u201d","and said to him
 \u201cDo you hear what these are saying?\u201d Jesus said to them
 \u201cYes; have you never read
 \u2018Out of the mouths of infants and nursing babies you have prepared praise for yourself\u2019?\u201d","And seeing a fig tree by the side of the road
 he went to it and found nothing at all on it but leaves. Then he said to it
 \u201cMay no fruit ever come from you again!\u201d And the fig tree withered at once. ","Jesus answered them
 \u201cTruly I tell you
 if you have faith and do not doubt
 not only will you do what has been done to the fig tree
 but even if you say to this mountain
 \u2018Be lifted up and thrown into the sea
\u2019 it will be done. ","Whatever you ask for in prayer with faith
 you will receive.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cI will also ask you one question; if you tell me the answer
 then I will also tell you by what authority I do these things. ","Did the baptism of John come from heaven

 \u201cWe do not know.\u201d And he said to them
 \u201cNeither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.","\u201cWhat do you think? A man had two sons; he went to the first and said
 \u2018Son

 \u2018I will not\u2019; but later he changed his mind and went. ","The father went to the second and said the same; and he answered
 \u2018I go
 sir\u2019; but he did not go. ","Which of the two did the will of his father?\u201d They said
 \u201cThe first.\u201d Jesus said to them
 \u201cTruly I tell you
 the tax collectors and the prostitutes are going into the kingdom of God ahead of you. ","For John came to you in the way of righteousness and you did not believe him
 but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him; and even after you saw it
 you did not change your minds and believe him.","\u201cListen to another parable. There was a landowner who planted a vineyard
 put a fence around it
 dug a wine press in it
 and built a watchtower. Then he leased it to tenants and went to another country. ","When the harvest time had come
 he sent his slaves to the tenants to collect his produce. ","But the tenants seized his slaves and beat one
 killed another
 and stoned another. ","Again he sent other slaves
 more than the first; and they treated them in the same way. ","Finally he sent his son to them

 \u2018They will respect my son.\u2019 ","But when the tenants saw the son
 they said to themselves
 \u2018This is the heir; come
 let us kill him and get his inheritance.\u2019 ","So they seized him
 threw him out of the vineyard
 and killed him. ","Now when the owner of the vineyard comes
 what will he do to those tenants?\u201d ","They said to him
 \u201cHe will put those wretches to a miserable death

 I have prepared my dinner

 both good and bad; so the wedding hall was filled with guests.","\u201cBut when the king came in to see the guests

 the gold or the sanctuary that has made the gold sacred? ","And you say
 \u2018Whoever swears by the altar is bound by nothing
 but whoever swears by the gift that is on the altar is bound by the oath.\u2019 ","How blind you are! For which is greater
 the gift or the altar that makes the gift sacred? ","So whoever swears by the altar
 swears by it and by everything on it; ","and whoever swears by the sanctuary
 swears by it and by the one who dwells in it; ","and whoever swears by heaven
 swears by the throne of God and by the one who is seated upon it.","\u201cWoe to you
 scribes and Pharisees
 hypocrites! For you tithe mint
 dill
 and cummin
 and have neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice and mercy and faith. It is these you ought to have practiced without neglecting the others. ","You blind guides! You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel!","\u201cWoe to you
 scribes and Pharisees
 hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and of the plate
 but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence. ","You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup
 so that the outside also may become clean.","\u201cWoe to you
 scribes and Pharisees
 hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs
 which on the outside look beautiful
 but inside they are full of the bones of the dead and of all kinds of filth. ","So you also on the outside look righteous to others
 but inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.","\u201cWoe to you
 scribes and Pharisees
 hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous
 ","and you say
 \u2018If we had lived in the days of our ancestors
 we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.\u2019 ","Thus you testify against yourselves that you are descendants of those who murdered the prophets.","Fill up
 then
 the measure of your ancestors. ","You snakes
 you brood of vipers! How can you escape being sentenced to hell? ","Therefore I send you prophets
 sages
 and scribes
 some of whom you will kill and crucify
 and some you will flog in your synagogues and pursue from town to town
 ","so that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed on earth
 from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Barachiah
 whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar. ","Truly I tell you
 all this will come upon this generation.","\u201cJerusalem
 Jerusalem
 the city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it! How often have I desired to gather your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings
 and you were not willing! ","See
 your house is left to you
 desolate. ","For I tell you
 you will not see me again until you say
 \u2018Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord.\u2019\u201d","Then he asked them
 \u201cYou see all these
 do you not? Truly I tell you
 not one stone will be left here upon another; all will be thrown down.\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cBeware that no one leads you astray. ","For many will come in my name
 saying
 \u2018I am the Messiah!\u2019 and they will lead many astray. ","And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars; see that you are not alarmed; for this must take place
 but the end is not yet. ","For nation will rise against nation
 and kingdom against kingdom
 and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places: ","all this is but the beginning of the birth pangs.","\u201cThen they will hand you over to be tortured and will put you to death
 and you will be hated by all nations because of my name. ","Then many will fall away
 and they will betray one another and hate one another. ","And many false prophets will arise and lead many astray.","And because of the increase of lawlessness
 the love of many will grow cold. ","But the one who endures to the end will be saved.","And this good news of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the world
 as a testimony to all the nations; and then the end will come.","\u201cSo when you see the desolating sacrilege standing in the holy place
 as was spoken of by the prophet Daniel (let the reader understand)
 ","then those in Judea must flee to the mountains;","the one on the housetop must not go down to take what is in the house;","the one in the field must not turn back to get a coat.","Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing infants in those days!","Pray that your flight may not be in winter or on a sabbath.","For at that time there will be great suffering
 such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now
 no
 and never will be. ","And if those days had not been cut short
 no one would be saved; but for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short. ","Then if anyone says to you
 \u2018Look! Here is the Messiah!\u2019 or \u2018There he is!\u2019\u2014do not believe it. ","For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and produce great signs and omens
 to lead astray
 if possible
 even the elect. ","Take note
 I have told you beforehand. ","So
 if they say to you
 \u2018Look! He is in the wilderness
\u2019 do not go out. If they say
 \u2018Look! He is in the inner rooms
\u2019 do not believe it. ","For as the lightning comes from the east and flashes as far as the west
 so will be the coming of the Son of Man. ","Wherever the corpse is
 there the vultures will gather.","\u201cImmediately after the suffering of those days the sun will be darkened
 and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from heaven
 and the powers of heaven will be shaken.","Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven
 and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn
 and they will see \u2018the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven\u2019 with power and great glory. ","And he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call
 and they will gather his elect from the four winds
 from one end of heaven to the other.","\u201cFrom the fig tree learn its lesson: as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts forth its leaves
 you know that summer is near. ","So also
 when you see all these things
 you know that he is near
 at the very gates. ","Truly I tell you
 this generation will not pass away until all these things have taken place. ","Heaven and earth will pass away
 but my words will not pass away.","\u201cBut about that day and hour no one knows
 neither the angels of heaven
 nor the Son
 but only the Father. ","For as the days of Noah were
 so will be the coming of the Son of Man. ","For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking
 marrying and giving in marriage
 until the day Noah entered the ark
 ","and they knew nothing until the flood came and swept them all away
 so too will be the coming of the Son of Man. ","Then two will be in the field; one will be taken and one will be left.","Two women will be grinding meal together; one will be taken and one will be left.","Keep awake therefore
 for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming. ","But understand this: if the owner of the house had known in what part of the night the thief was coming
 he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken into. ","Therefore you also must be ready
 for the Son of Man is coming at an unexpected hour.","\u201cWho then is the faithful and wise slave
 whom his master has put in charge of his household
 to give the other slaves their allowance of food at the proper time? ","Blessed is that slave whom his master will find at work when he arrives.","Truly I tell you
 he will put that one in charge of all his possessions. ","But if that wicked slave says to himself
 \u2018My master is delayed
\u2019 ","and he begins to beat his fellow slaves
 and eats and drinks with drunkards
 ","the master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour that he does not know.","He will cut him in pieces and put him with the hypocrites
 where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.","\u201cThen the kingdom of heaven will be like this. Ten bridesmaids took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom.","Five of them were foolish
 and five were wise. ","When the foolish took their lamps
 they took no oil with them; ","but the wise took flasks of oil with their lamps.","As the bridegroom was delayed
 all of them became drowsy and slept. ","But at midnight there was a shout
 \u2018Look! Here is the bridegroom! Come out to meet him.\u2019 ","Then all those bridesmaids got up and trimmed their lamps.","The foolish said to the wise
 \u2018Give us some of your oil
 for our lamps are going out.\u2019 ","But the wise replied
 \u2018No! there will not be enough for you and for us; you had better go to the dealers and buy some for yourselves.\u2019 ","And while they went to buy it
 the bridegroom came
 and those who were ready went with him into the wedding banquet; and the door was shut. ","Later the other bridesmaids came also
 saying
 \u2018Lord
 lord
 open to us.\u2019 ","But he replied
 \u2018Truly I tell you
 I do not know you.\u2019 ","Keep awake therefore
 for you know neither the day nor the hour.","\u201cFor it is as if a man
 going on a journey
 summoned his slaves and entrusted his property to them; ","to one he gave five talents
 to another two
 to another one
 to each according to his ability. Then he went away. ","The one who had received the five talents went off at once and traded with them
 and made five more talents. ","In the same way
 the one who had the two talents made two more talents. ","But the one who had received the one talent went off and dug a hole in the ground and hid his master\u2019s money.","After a long time the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them.","Then the one who had received the five talents came forward
 bringing five more talents
 saying
 \u2018Master
 you handed over to me five talents; see
 I have made five more talents.\u2019 ","His master said to him
 \u2018Well done
 good and trustworthy slave; you have been trustworthy in a few things
 I will put you in charge of many things; enter into the joy of your master.\u2019 ","And the one with the two talents also came forward
 saying
 \u2018Master
 you handed over to me two talents; see
 I have made two more talents.\u2019 ","His master said to him
 \u2018Well done
 good and trustworthy slave; you have been trustworthy in a few things
 I will put you in charge of many things; enter into the joy of your master.\u2019 ","Then the one who had received the one talent also came forward
 saying
 \u2018Master
 I knew that you were a harsh man
 reaping where you did not sow
 and gathering where you did not scatter seed; ","so I was afraid
 and I went and hid your talent in the ground. Here you have what is yours.\u2019 ","But his master replied
 \u2018You wicked and lazy slave! You knew
 did you
 that I reap where I did not sow
 and gather where I did not scatter? ","Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers
 and on my return I would have received what was my own with interest. ","So take the talent from him
 and give it to the one with the ten talents. ","For to all those who have
 more will be given
 and they will have an abundance; but from those who have nothing
 even what they have will be taken away. ","As for this worthless slave
 throw him into the outer darkness
 where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\u2019","\u201cWhen the Son of Man comes in his glory
 and all the angels with him
 then he will sit on the throne of his glory. ","All the nations will be gathered before him
 and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats
 ","and he will put the sheep at his right hand and the goats at the left.","Then the king will say to those at his right hand
 \u2018Come
 you that are blessed by my Father
 inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world; ","for I was hungry and you gave me food
 I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink
 I was a stranger and you welcomed me
 ","I was naked and you gave me clothing
 I was sick and you took care of me
 I was in prison and you visited me.\u2019 ","Then the righteous will answer him
 \u2018Lord
 when was it that we saw you hungry and gave you food
 or thirsty and gave you something to drink? ","And when was it that we saw you a stranger and welcomed you
 or naked and gave you clothing? ","And when was it that we saw you sick or in prison and visited you?\u2019","And the king will answer them
 \u2018Truly I tell you
 just as you did it to one of the least of these who are members of my family
 you did it to me.\u2019 ","Then he will say to those at his left hand
 \u2018You that are accursed
 depart from me into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels; ","for I was hungry and you gave me no food
 I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink
 ","I was a stranger and you did not welcome me
 naked and you did not give me clothing
 sick and in prison and you did not visit me.\u2019 ","Then they also will answer
 \u2018Lord
 when was it that we saw you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison
 and did not take care of you?\u2019 ","Then he will answer them
 \u2018Truly I tell you
 just as you did not do it to one of the least of these
 you did not do it to me.\u2019 ","And these will go away into eternal punishment
 but the righteous into eternal life.\u201d","\u201cYou know that after two days the Passover is coming
 and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.\u201d","But Jesus
 aware of this
 said to them
 \u201cWhy do you trouble the woman? She has performed a good service for me. ","For you always have the poor with you
 but you will not always have me. ","By pouring this ointment on my body she has prepared me for burial.","Truly I tell you
 wherever this good news is proclaimed in the whole world
 what she has done will be told in remembrance of her.\u201d","He said
 \u201cGo into the city to a certain man
 and say to him
 \u2018The Teacher says
 My time is near; I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.\u2019\u201d ","and while they were eating
 he said
 \u201cTruly I tell you
 one of you will betray me.\u201d ","He answered
 \u201cThe one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me. ","The Son of Man goes as it is written of him
 but woe to that one by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that one not to have been born.\u201d ","Judas
 who betrayed him
 said
 \u201cSurely not I
 Rabbi?\u201d He replied
 \u201cYou have said so.\u201d","While they were eating
 Jesus took a loaf of bread
 and after blessing it he broke it
 gave it to the disciples
 and said
 \u201cTake
 eat; this is my body.\u201d ","Then he took a cup
 and after giving thanks he gave it to them
 saying
 \u201cDrink from it
 all of you; ","for this is my blood of the covenant
 which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. ","I tell you
 I will never again drink of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father\u2019s kingdom.\u201d","Then Jesus said to them
 \u201cYou will all become deserters because of me this night; for it is written
 \u2018I will strike the shepherd
 and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.\u2019","But after I am raised up
 I will go ahead of you to Galilee.\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cTruly I tell you
 this very night
 before the cock crows
 you will deny me three times.\u201d ","Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane; and he said to his disciples
 \u201cSit here while I go over there and pray.\u201d ","Then he said to them
 \u201cI am deeply grieved
 even to death; remain here
 and stay awake with me.\u201d ","And going a little farther
 he threw himself on the ground and prayed
 \u201cMy Father
 if it is possible
 let this cup pass from me; yet not what I want but what you want.\u201d ","Then he came to the disciples and found them sleeping; and he said to Peter
 \u201cSo
 could you not stay awake with me one hour? ","Stay awake and pray that you may not come into the time of trial; the spirit indeed is willing
 but the flesh is weak.\u201d ","Again he went away for the second time and prayed
 \u201cMy Father
 if this cannot pass unless I drink it
 your will be done.\u201d ","Then he came to the disciples and said to them
 \u201cAre you still sleeping and taking your rest? See
 the hour is at hand
 and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. ","Get up
 let us be going. See
 my betrayer is at hand.\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cFriend
 do what you are here to do.\u201d Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and arrested him. ","Then Jesus said to him
 \u201cPut your sword back into its place; for all who take the sword will perish by the sword. ","Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father
 and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of angels? ","But how then would the scriptures be fulfilled
 which say it must happen in this way?\u201d ","At that hour Jesus said to the crowds
 \u201cHave you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me as though I were a bandit? Day after day I sat in the temple teaching
 and you did not arrest me. ","But all this has taken place
 so that the scriptures of the prophets may be fulfilled.\u201d Then all the disciples deserted him and fled.","Jesus said to him
 \u201cYou have said so. But I tell you
 From now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven.\u201d","Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said: \u201cBefore the cock crows
 you will deny me three times.\u201d And he went out and wept bitterly.","Now Jesus stood before the governor; and the governor asked him
 \u201cAre you the King of the Jews?\u201d Jesus said
 \u201cYou say so.\u201d ","And about three o\u2019clock Jesus cried with a loud voice
 \u201cEli
 Eli

 \u201cMy God
 my God

 \u201cGreetings!\u201d And they came to him
 took hold of his feet
 and worshiped him. ","Then Jesus said to them
 \u201cDo not be afraid; go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me.\u201d","And Jesus came and said to them
 \u201cAll authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. ","Go therefore and make disciples of all nations

 I am with you always
 to the end of the age.\u201d","But Jesus answered him
 \u201cLet it be so now; for it is proper for us in this way to fulfill all righteousness.\u201d Then he consented. ","But he answered
 \u201cIt is written

 how can its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything
 but is thrown out and trampled under foot.","\u201cYou are the light of the world. A city built on a hill cannot be hid.","No one after lighting a lamp puts it under the bushel basket

 let your light shine before others

 until heaven and earth pass away
 not one letter
 not one stroke of a letter

 whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments
 and teaches others to do the same
 will be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. ","For I tell you
 unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees
 you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.","\u201cYou have heard that it was said to those of ancient times
 \u2018You shall not murder\u2019; and \u2018whoever murders shall be liable to judgment.\u2019 ","But I say to you that if you are angry with a brother or sister
 you will be liable to judgment; and if you insult a brother or sister

 \u2018You fool
\u2019 you will be liable to the hell of fire. ","So when you are offering your gift at the altar
 if you remember that your brother or sister has something against you
 ","leave your gift there before the altar and go; first be reconciled to your brother or sister
 and then come and offer your gift. ","Come to terms quickly with your accuser while you are on the way to court with him

 you will never get out until you have paid the last penny.","\u201cYou have heard that it was said
 \u2018You shall not commit adultery.\u2019 ","But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her in his heart.","If your right eye causes you to sin
 tear it out and throw it away; it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. ","And if your right hand causes you to sin
 cut it off and throw it away; it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to go into hell.","\u201cIt was also said
 \u2018Whoever divorces his wife
 let him give her a certificate of divorce.\u2019 ","But I say to you that anyone who divorces his wife
 except on the ground of unchastity
 causes her to commit adultery; and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.","\u201cAgain
 you have heard that it was said to those of ancient times
 \u2018You shall not swear falsely
 but carry out the vows you have made to the Lord.\u2019 ","But I say to you
 Do not swear at all
 either by heaven

 for you cannot make one hair white or black. ","Let your word be \u2018Yes
 Yes\u2019 or \u2018No
 No\u2019; anything more than this comes from the evil one.","\u201cYou have heard that it was said
 \u2018An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.\u2019 ","But I say to you
 Do not resist an evildoer. But if anyone strikes you on the right cheek
 turn the other also; ","and if anyone wants to sue you and take your coat
 give your cloak as well; ","and if anyone forces you to go one mile
 go also the second mile. ","Give to everyone who begs from you
 and do not refuse anyone who wants to borrow from you.","\u201cYou have heard that it was said
 \u2018You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.\u2019 ","But I say to you
 Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you

 and sends rain on the righteous and on the unrighteous. ","For if you love those who love you
 what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? ","And if you greet only your brothers and sisters
 what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same? ","Be perfect
 therefore
 as your heavenly Father is perfect.","\u201cBeware of practicing your piety before others in order to be seen by them; for then you have no reward from your Father in heaven.","\u201cSo whenever you give alms
 do not sound a trumpet before you
 as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets
 so that they may be praised by others. Truly I tell you
 they have received their reward. ","But when you give alms
 do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing
 ","so that your alms may be done in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.","\u201cAnd whenever you pray
 do not be like the hypocrites; for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners
 so that they may be seen by others. Truly I tell you
 they have received their reward. ","But whenever you pray
 go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.","\u201cWhen you are praying
 do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do; for they think that they will be heard because of their many words. ","Do not be like them
 for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.","\u201cPray then in this way: Our Father in heaven
 hallowed be your name.","    Your kingdom come. Your will be done
 on earth as it is in heaven.","Give us this day our daily bread.","    And forgive us our debts
 as we also have forgiven our debtors.","    And do not bring us to the time of trial
 but rescue us from the evil one.","For if you forgive others their trespasses
 your heavenly Father will also forgive you; ","but if you do not forgive others
 neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.","\u201cAnd whenever you fast
 do not look dismal
 like the hypocrites
 for they disfigure their faces so as to show others that they are fasting. Truly I tell you
 they have received their reward. ","But when you fast
 put oil on your head and wash your face
 ","so that your fasting may be seen not by others but by your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.","\u201cDo not store up for yourselves treasures on earth
 where moth and rust consume and where thieves break in and steal; ","but store up for yourselves treasures in heaven
 where neither moth nor rust consumes and where thieves do not break in and steal. ","For where your treasure is
 there your heart will be also.","\u201cThe eye is the lamp of the body. So
 if your eye is healthy
 your whole body will be full of light; ","but if your eye is unhealthy
 your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light in you is darkness
 how great is the darkness!","\u201cNo one can serve two masters; for a slave will either hate the one and love the other
 or be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth.","\u201cTherefore I tell you
 do not worry about your life
 what you will eat or what you will drink
 or about your body
 what you will wear. Is not life more than food
 and the body more than clothing? ","Look at the birds of the air; they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns
 and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? ","And can any of you by worrying add a single hour to your span of life?","And why do you worry about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field
 how they grow; they neither toil nor spin
 ","yet I tell you
 even Solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these. ","But if God so clothes the grass of the field

 will he not much more clothe you\u2014you of little faith? ","Therefore do not worry
 saying
 \u2018What will we eat?\u2019 or \u2018What will we drink?\u2019 or \u2018What will we wear?\u2019 ","For it is the Gentiles who strive for all these things; and indeed your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.","But strive first for the kingdom of God and his righteousness
 and all these things will be given to you as well.","\u201cSo do not worry about tomorrow
 for tomorrow will bring worries of its own. Today\u2019s trouble is enough for today.","\u201cDo not judge
 so that you may not be judged. ","For with the judgment you make you will be judged
 and the measure you give will be the measure you get. ","Why do you see the speck in your neighbor\u2019s eye
 but do not notice the log in your own eye? ","Or how can you say to your neighbor
 \u2018Let me take the speck out of your eye

 and they say
 \u2018He has a demon\u2019; ","the Son of Man came eating and drinking

 \u2018Look

 because they did not repent. ","\u201cWoe to you
 Chorazin! Woe to you

 it would have remained until this day. ","But I tell you that on the day of judgment it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom than for you.\u201d","At that time Jesus said
 \u201cI thank  you

 \u201cHave you not read what David did when he and his companions were hungry? ","He entered the house of God and ate the bread of the Presence

 something greater than the temple is here. ","But if you had known what this means
 \u2018I desire mercy and not sacrifice
\u2019 you would not have condemned the guiltless. ","For the Son of Man is lord of the sabbath.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cSuppose one of you has only one sheep and it falls into a pit on the sabbath; will you not lay hold of it and lift it out? ","How much more valuable is a human being than a sheep! So it is lawful to do good on the sabbath.\u201d","Then he said to the man
 \u201cStretch out your hand.\u201d He stretched it out
 and it was restored
 as sound as the other. ","He knew what they were thinking and said to them

 by whom do your own exorcists cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges. ","But if it is by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons
 then the kingdom of God has come to you. ","Or how can one enter a strong man\u2019s house and plunder his property
 without first tying up the strong man? Then indeed the house can be plundered. ","Whoever is not with me is against me

 people will be forgiven for every sin and blasphemy
 but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. ","Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven

 either in this age or in the age to come.","\u201cEither make the tree good
 and its fruit good; or make the tree bad
 and its fruit bad; for the tree is known by its fruit. ","You brood of vipers! How can you speak good things
 when you are evil? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. ","The good person brings good things out of a good treasure
 and the evil person brings evil things out of an evil treasure. ","I tell you
 on the day of judgment you will have to give an account for every careless word you utter; ","for by your words you will be justified
 and by your words you will be condemned.\u201d","But he answered them
 \u201cAn evil and adulterous generation asks for a sign
 but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. ","For just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the sea monster
 so for three days and three nights the Son of Man will be in the heart of the earth. ","The people of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it
 because they repented at the proclamation of Jonah

 something greater than Jonah is here! ","The queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it

 and see
 something greater than Solomon is here!","\u201cWhen the unclean spirit has gone out of a person
 it wanders through waterless regions looking for a resting place
 but it finds none. ","Then it says
 \u2018I will return to my house from which I came.\u2019 When it comes
 it finds it empty
 swept
 and put in order. ","Then it goes and brings along seven other spirits more evil than itself
 and they enter and live there; and the last state of that person is worse than the first. So will it be also with this evil generation.\u201d","While he was still speaking to the crowds
 his mother and his brothers were standing outside
 wanting to speak to him. ","But to the one who had told him this
 Jesus replied
 \u201cWho is my mother
 and who are my brothers?\u201d ","And pointing to his disciples
 he said
 \u201cHere are my mother and my brothers! ","For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.\u201d","And he told them many things in parables
 saying: \u201cListen! A sower went out to sow. ","And as he sowed
 some seeds fell on the path
 and the birds came and ate them up. ","Other seeds fell on rocky ground
 where they did not have much soil
 and they sprang up quickly
 since they had no depth of soil. ","But when the sun rose
 they were scorched; and since they had no root
 they withered away. ","Other seeds fell among thorns
 and the thorns grew up and choked them. ","Other seeds fell on good soil and brought forth grain
 some a hundredfold
 some sixty
 some thirty. ","Let anyone with ears listen!\u201d","He answered
 \u201cTo you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven
 but to them it has not been given. ","For to those who have
 more will be given
 and they will have an abundance; but from those who have nothing
 even what they have will be taken away. ","The reason I speak to them in parables is that \u2018seeing they do not perceive
 and hearing they do not listen
 nor do they understand.\u2019 ","With them indeed is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah that says: \u2018You will indeed listen
 but never understand
 and you will indeed look
 but never perceive.","For this people\u2019s heart has grown dull
 and their ears are hard of hearing
 and they have shut their eyes; so that they might not look with their eyes
 and listen with their ears
 and understand with their heart and turn\u2014 and I would heal them.\u2019","But blessed are your eyes
 for they see
 and your ears
 for they hear. ","Truly I tell you
 many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see
 but did not see it
 and to hear what you hear
 but did not hear it.","\u201cHear then the parable of the sower.","When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it
 the evil one comes and snatches away what is sown in the heart; this is what was sown on the path. ","As for what was sown on rocky ground
 this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy; ","yet such a person has no root
 but endures only for a while
 and when trouble or persecution arises on account of the word
 that person immediately falls away. ","As for what was sown among thorns
 this is the one who hears the word
 but the cares of the world and the lure of wealth choke the word
 and it yields nothing. ","But as for what was sown on good soil
 this is the one who hears the word and understands it
 who indeed bears fruit and yields
 in one case a hundredfold
 in another sixty
 and in another thirty.\u201d","He put before them another parable: \u201cThe kingdom of heaven may be compared to someone who sowed good seed in his field;","but while everybody was asleep
 an enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat
 and then went away. ","So when the plants came up and bore grain
 then the weeds appeared as well. ","And the slaves of the householder came and said to him
 \u2018Master
 did you not sow good seed in your field? Where
 then
 did these weeds come from?\u2019 ","He answered
 \u2018An enemy has done this.\u2019 The slaves said to him
 \u2018Then do you want us to go and gather them?\u2019 ","But he replied
 \u2018No; for in gathering the weeds you would uproot the wheat along with them. ","Let both of them grow together until the harvest; and at harvest time I will tell the reapers
 Collect the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned
 but gather the wheat into my barn.\u2019\u201d","He put before them another parable: \u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that someone took and sowed in his field;","it is the smallest of all the seeds
 but when it has grown it is the greatest of shrubs and becomes a tree
 so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches.\u201d","He told them another parable: \u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed in with three measures of flour until all of it was leavened.\u201d","He answered
 \u201cThe one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man; ","the field is the world
 and the good seed are the children of the kingdom; the weeds are the children of the evil one
 ","and the enemy who sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the age
 and the reapers are angels. ","Just as the weeds are collected and burned up with fire
 so will it be at the end of the age. ","The Son of Man will send his angels
 and they will collect out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all evildoers
 ","and they will throw them into the furnace of fire
 where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. ","Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Let anyone with ears listen!","\u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field
 which someone found and hid; then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.","\u201cAgain
 the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls; ","on finding one pearl of great value
 he went and sold all that he had and bought it.","\u201cAgain
 the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea and caught fish of every kind; ","when it was full
 they drew it ashore
 sat down
 and put the good into baskets but threw out the bad. ","So it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come out and separate the evil from the righteous","and throw them into the furnace of fire
 where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.","\u201cHave you understood all this?\u201d They answered
 \u201cYes.\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cTherefore every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a household who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old.\u201d ","And they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them
 \u201cProphets are not without honor except in their own country and in their own house.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cThey need not go away; you give them something to eat.\u201d ","And he said
 \u201cBring them here to me.\u201d ","But immediately Jesus spoke to them and said
 \u201cTake heart
 it is I; do not be afraid.\u201d","He said
 \u201cCome.\u201d So Peter got out of the boat
 started walking on the water
 and came toward Jesus. ","Jesus immediately reached out his hand and caught him
 saying to him
 \u201cYou of little faith
 why did you doubt?\u201d ","He answered them
 \u201cAnd why do you break the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition? ","For God said
 \u2018Honor your father and your mother
\u2019 and
 \u2018Whoever speaks evil of father or mother must surely die.\u2019 ","But you say that whoever tells father or mother
 \u2018Whatever support you might have had from me is given to God
\u2019 then that person need not honor the father. ","So
 for the sake of your tradition
 you make void the word of God. ","You hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied rightly about you when he said:","\u2018This people honors me with their lips
 but their hearts are far from me;","in vain do they worship me
 teaching human precepts as doctrines.\u2019\u201d","Then he called the crowd to him and said to them
 \u201cListen and understand: ","it is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person
 but it is what comes out of the mouth that defiles.\u201d ","He answered
 \u201cEvery plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted. ","Let them alone; they are blind guides of the blind. And if one blind person guides another
 both will fall into a pit.\u201d ","Then he said
 \u201cAre you also still without understanding? ","Do you not see that whatever goes into the mouth enters the stomach
 and goes out into the sewer? ","But what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart
 and this is what defiles. ","For out of the heart come evil intentions
 murder
 adultery
 fornication
 theft
 false witness
 slander. ","These are what defile a person
 but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile.\u201d","He answered
 \u201cI was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\u201d ","He answered
 \u201cIt is not fair to take the children\u2019s food and throw it to the dogs.\u201d ","Then Jesus answered her
 \u201cWoman
 great is your faith! Let it be done for you as you wish.\u201d And her daughter was healed instantly.","Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said
 \u201cI have compassion for the crowd
 because they have been with me now for three days and have nothing to eat; and I do not want to send them away hungry
 for they might faint on the way.\u201d ","Jesus asked them
 \u201cHow many loaves have you?\u201d They said
 \u201cSeven
 and a few small fish.\u201d ","He answered them
 \u201cWhen it is evening
 you say
 \u2018It will be fair weather
 for the sky is red.\u2019 ","And in the morning
 \u2018It will be stormy today
 for the sky is red and threatening.\u2019 You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky
 but you cannot interpret the signs of the times. ","An evil and adulterous generation asks for a sign
 but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah.\u201d Then he left them and went away.","Jesus said to them
 \u201cWatch out
 and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\u201d ","And becoming aware of it
 Jesus said
 \u201cYou of little faith
 why are you talking about having no bread? ","Do you still not perceive? Do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand
 and how many baskets you gathered? ","Or the seven loaves for the four thousand
 and how many baskets you gathered? ","How could you fail to perceive that I was not speaking about bread? Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees!\u201d","Now when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi
 he asked his disciples
 \u201cWho do people say that the Son of Man is?\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cBut who do you say that I am?\u201d ","And Jesus answered him
 \u201cBlessed are you

 \u201cGet behind me
 Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are setting your mind not on divine things but on human things.\u201d","Then Jesus told his disciples
 \u201cIf any want to become my followers
 let them deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me. ","For those who want to save their life will lose it
 and those who lose their life for my sake will find it. ","For what will it profit them if they gain the whole world but forfeit their life? Or what will they give in return for their life?","\u201cFor the Son of Man is to come with his angels in the glory of his Father

 there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.\u201d","But Jesus came and touched them
 saying
 \u201cGet up and do not be afraid.\u201d ","As they were coming down the mountain

 \u201cElijah is indeed coming and will restore all things; ","but I tell you that Elijah has already come

 how much longer must I be with you? How much longer must I put up with you? Bring him here to me.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cBecause of your little faith. For truly I tell you
 if you have faith the size of a mustard seed
 you will say to this mountain
 \u2018Move from here to there
\u2019 and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you.\u201d","As they were gathering in Galilee
 Jesus said to them
 \u201cThe Son of Man is going to be betrayed into human hands
 ","and they will kill him
 and on the third day he will be raised.\u201d And they were greatly distressed.","He said
 \u201cYes
 he does.\u201d And when he came home
 Jesus spoke of it first
 asking
 \u201cWhat do you think
 Simon? From whom do kings of the earth take toll or tribute? From their children or from others?\u201d ","When Peter said
 \u201cFrom others
\u201d Jesus said to him
 \u201cThen the children are free. ","However
 so that we do not give offense to them
 go to the sea and cast a hook; take the first fish that comes up; and when you open its mouth
 you will find a coin; take that and give it to them for you and me.\u201d","and said
 \u201cTruly I tell you
 unless you change and become like children
 you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. ","Whoever becomes humble like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.","Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me.","\u201cIf any of you put a stumbling block before one of these little ones who believe in me
 it would be better for you if a great millstone were fastened around your neck and you were drowned in the depth of the sea. ","Woe to the world because of stumbling blocks! Occasions for stumbling are bound to come
 but woe to the one by whom the stumbling block comes!","\u201cIf your hand or your foot causes you to stumble
 cut it off and throw it away; it is better for you to enter life maimed or lame than to have two hands or two feet and to be thrown into the eternal fire. ","And if your eye causes you to stumble
 tear it out and throw it away; it is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and to be thrown into the hell of fire.","\u201cTake care that you do not despise one of these little ones; for
 I tell you
 in heaven their angels continually see the face of my Father in heaven. ","What do you think? If a shepherd has a hundred sheep
 and one of them has gone astray
 does he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go in search of the one that went astray? ","And if he finds it
 truly I tell you
 he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that never went astray. ","So it is not the will of your Father in heaven that one of these little ones should be lost.","\u201cIf another member of the church sins against you
 go and point out the fault when the two of you are alone. If the member listens to you
 you have regained that one. ","But if you are not listened to
 take one or two others along with you
 so that every word may be confirmed by the evidence of two or three witnesses. ","If the member refuses to listen to them
 tell it to the church; and if the offender refuses to listen even to the church
 let such a one be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector. ","Truly I tell you
 whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven
 and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven. ","Again
 truly I tell you
 if two of you agree on earth about anything you ask
 it will be done for you by my Father in heaven. ","For where two or three are gathered in my name
 I am there among them.\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cNot seven times
 but
 I tell you
 seventy-seven times.","\u201cFor this reason the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his slaves.","When he began the reckoning
 one who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him; ","and
 as he could not pay
 his lord ordered him to be sold
 together with his wife and children and all his possessions
 and payment to be made. ","So the slave fell on his knees before him
 saying
 \u2018Have patience with me
 and I will pay you everything.\u2019 ","And out of pity for him
 the lord of that slave released him and forgave him the debt. ","But that same slave
 as he went out
 came upon one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii; and seizing him by the throat
 he said
 \u2018Pay what you owe.\u2019 ","Then his fellow slave fell down and pleaded with him
 \u2018Have patience with me
 and I will pay you.\u2019 ","But he refused; then he went and threw him into prison until he would pay the debt.","When his fellow slaves saw what had happened
 they were greatly distressed
 and they went and reported to their lord all that had taken place. ","Then his lord summoned him and said to him
 \u2018You wicked slave! I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me. ","Should you not have had mercy on your fellow slave
 as I had mercy on you?\u2019 ","And in anger his lord handed him over to be tortured until he would pay his entire debt.","So my heavenly Father will also do to every one of you
 if you do not forgive your brother or sister from your heart.\u201d","He answered
 \u201cHave you not read that the one who made them at the beginning \u2018made them male and female
\u2019 ","and said
 \u2018For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife
 and the two shall become one flesh\u2019? ","So they are no longer two
 but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together
 let no one separate.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cIt was because you were so hard-hearted that Moses allowed you to divorce your wives
 but from the beginning it was not so. ","And I say to you
 whoever divorces his wife
 except for unchastity
 and marries another commits adultery.\u201d","But he said to them
 \u201cNot everyone can accept this teaching
 but only those to whom it is given. ","For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth
 and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others
 and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let anyone accept this who can.\u201d","but Jesus said
 \u201cLet the little children come to me
 and do not stop them; for it is to such as these that the kingdom of heaven belongs.\u201d ","And he said to him
 \u201cWhy do you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good. If you wish to enter into life
 keep the commandments.\u201d ","He said to him
 \u201cWhich ones?\u201d And Jesus said
 \u201cYou shall not murder; You shall not commit adultery; You shall not steal; You shall not bear false witness; ","Honor your father and mother; also
 You shall love your neighbor as yourself.\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cIf you wish to be perfect
 go
 sell your possessions
 and give the money to the poor
 and you will have treasure in heaven; then come
 follow me.\u201d ","Then Jesus said to his disciples
 \u201cTruly I tell you
 it will be hard for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven. ","Again I tell you
 it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.\u201d ","But Jesus looked at them and said
 \u201cFor mortals it is impossible
 but for God all things are possible.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cTruly I tell you
 at the renewal of all things
 when the Son of Man is seated on the throne of his glory
 you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones
 judging the twelve tribes of Israel. ","And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields
 for my name\u2019s sake
 will receive a hundredfold
 and will inherit eternal life. ","But many who are first will be last
 and the last will be first.","\u201cFor the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.","After agreeing with the laborers for the usual daily wage
 he sent them into his vineyard. ","When he went out about nine o\u2019clock
 he saw others standing idle in the marketplace; ","and he said to them
 \u2018You also go into the vineyard
 and I will pay you whatever is right.\u2019 So they went. ","When he went out again about noon and about three o\u2019clock
 he did the same. ","And about five o\u2019clock he went out and found others standing around; and he said to them
 \u2018Why are you standing here idle all day?\u2019 ","They said to him
 \u2018Because no one has hired us.\u2019 He said to them
 \u2018You also go into the vineyard.\u2019 ","When evening came
 the owner of the vineyard said to his manager
 \u2018Call the laborers and give them their pay
 beginning with the last and then going to the first.\u2019 ","When those hired about five o\u2019clock came
 each of them received the usual daily wage. ","Now when the first came
 they thought they would receive more; but each of them also received the usual daily wage. ","And when they received it
 they grumbled against the landowner
 ","saying
 \u2018These last worked only one hour
 and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat.\u2019 ","But he replied to one of them
 \u2018Friend
 I am doing you no wrong; did you not agree with me for the usual daily wage? ","Take what belongs to you and go; I choose to give to this last the same as I give to you.","Am I not allowed to do what I choose with what belongs to me? Or are you envious because I am generous?\u2019","So the last will be first
 and the first will be last.\u201d","\u201cSee
 we are going up to Jerusalem
 and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and scribes
 and they will condemn him to death; ","then they will hand him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and flogged and crucified; and on the third day he will be raised.\u201d","And he said to her
 \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d She said to him
 \u201cDeclare that these two sons of mine will sit
 one at your right hand and one at your left
 in your kingdom.\u201d ","But Jesus answered
 \u201cYou do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink?\u201d They said to him
 \u201cWe are able.\u201d ","But Jesus called them to him and said
 \u201cYou know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them
 and their great ones are tyrants over them. ","It will not be so among you; but whoever wishes to be great among you must be your servant
 ","and whoever wishes to be first among you must be your slave;","just as the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve
 and to give his life a ransom for many.\u201d","Jesus stood still and called them
 saying
 \u201cWhat do you want me to do for you?\u201d ","saying to them
 \u201cGo into the village ahead of you
 and immediately you will find a donkey tied
 and a colt with her; untie them and bring them to me. ","If anyone says anything to you
 just say this
 \u2018The Lord needs them.\u2019 And he will send them immediately.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cIt is written
 \u2018My house shall be called a house of prayer\u2019; but you are making it a den of robbers.\u201d","and said to him
 \u201cDo you hear what these are saying?\u201d Jesus said to them
 \u201cYes; have you never read
 \u2018Out of the mouths of infants and nursing babies you have prepared praise for yourself\u2019?\u201d","And seeing a fig tree by the side of the road
 he went to it and found nothing at all on it but leaves. Then he said to it
 \u201cMay no fruit ever come from you again!\u201d And the fig tree withered at once. ","Jesus answered them
 \u201cTruly I tell you
 if you have faith and do not doubt
 not only will you do what has been done to the fig tree
 but even if you say to this mountain
 \u2018Be lifted up and thrown into the sea
\u2019 it will be done. ","Whatever you ask for in prayer with faith
 you will receive.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cI will also ask you one question; if you tell me the answer
 then I will also tell you by what authority I do these things. ","Did the baptism of John come from heaven
 or was it of human origin?\u201d And they argued with one another
 \u201cIf we say
 \u2018From heaven
\u2019 he will say to us
 \u2018Why then did you not believe him?\u2019 ","So they answered Jesus
 \u201cWe do not know.\u201d And he said to them
 \u201cNeither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.","\u201cWhat do you think? A man had two sons; he went to the first and said
 \u2018Son
 go and work in the vineyard today.\u2019 ","He answered
 \u2018I will not\u2019; but later he changed his mind and went. ","The father went to the second and said the same; and he answered
 \u2018I go
 sir\u2019; but he did not go. ","Which of the two did the will of his father?\u201d They said
 \u201cThe first.\u201d Jesus said to them
 \u201cTruly I tell you
 the tax collectors and the prostitutes are going into the kingdom of God ahead of you. ","For John came to you in the way of righteousness and you did not believe him
 but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him; and even after you saw it
 you did not change your minds and believe him.","\u201cListen to another parable. There was a landowner who planted a vineyard
 put a fence around it
 dug a wine press in it
 and built a watchtower. Then he leased it to tenants and went to another country. ","When the harvest time had come
 he sent his slaves to the tenants to collect his produce. ","But the tenants seized his slaves and beat one
 killed another
 and stoned another. ","Again he sent other slaves
 more than the first; and they treated them in the same way. ","Finally he sent his son to them
 saying
 \u2018They will respect my son.\u2019 ","But when the tenants saw the son
 they said to themselves
 \u2018This is the heir; come
 let us kill him and get his inheritance.\u2019 ","So they seized him
 threw him out of the vineyard
 and killed him. ","Now when the owner of the vineyard comes
 what will he do to those tenants?\u201d ","They said to him
 \u201cHe will put those wretches to a miserable death
 and lease the vineyard to other tenants who will give him the produce at the harvest time.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cHave you never read in the scriptures: \u2018The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; this was the Lord\u2019s doing
 and it is amazing in our eyes\u2019?","Therefore I tell you
 the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people that produces the fruits of the kingdom. ","The one who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; and it will crush anyone on whom it falls.\u201d","\u201cThe kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who gave a wedding banquet for his son.","He sent his slaves to call those who had been invited to the wedding banquet
 but they would not come. ","Again he sent other slaves
 saying
 \u2018Tell those who have been invited: Look
 I have prepared my dinner
 my oxen and my fat calves have been slaughtered
 and everything is ready; come to the wedding banquet.\u2019 ","But they made light of it and went away
 one to his farm
 another to his business
 ","while the rest seized his slaves
 mistreated them
 and killed them. ","The king was enraged. He sent his troops
 destroyed those murderers
 and burned their city. ","Then he said to his slaves
 \u2018The wedding is ready
 but those invited were not worthy. ","Go therefore into the main streets
 and invite everyone you find to the wedding banquet.\u2019 ","Those slaves went out into the streets and gathered all whom they found
 both good and bad; so the wedding hall was filled with guests.","\u201cBut when the king came in to see the guests
 he noticed a man there who was not wearing a wedding robe
 ","and he said to him
 \u2018Friend
 how did you get in here without a wedding robe?\u2019 And he was speechless. ","Then the king said to the attendants
 \u2018Bind him hand and foot
 and throw him into the outer darkness
 where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\u2019 ","For many are called
 but few are chosen.\u201d","But Jesus
 aware of their malice
 said
 \u201cWhy are you putting me to the test
 you hypocrites? ","Show me the coin used for the tax.\u201d And they brought him a denarius.","Then he said to them
 \u201cWhose head is this
 and whose title?\u201d ","They answered
 \u201cThe emperor\u2019s.\u201d Then he said to them
 \u201cGive therefore to the emperor the things that are the emperor\u2019s

 \u201cYou are wrong
 because you know neither the scriptures nor the power of God. ","For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage
 but are like angels in heaven. ","And as for the resurrection of the dead
 have you not read what was said to you by God
 ","\u2018I am the God of Abraham

","\u2018The Lord said to my Lord
 \u201cSit at my right hand

 how can he be his son?\u201d ","\u201cThe scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses\u2019 seat;","therefore
 do whatever they teach you and follow it; but do not do as they do
 for they do not practice what they teach. ","They tie up heavy burdens
 hard to bear
 and lay them on the shoulders of others; but they themselves are unwilling to lift a finger to move them. ","They do all their deeds to be seen by others; for they make their phylacteries broad and their fringes long.","They love to have the place of honor at banquets and the best seats in the synagogues

 blind guides

 the gold or the sanctuary that has made the gold sacred? ","And you say
 \u2018Whoever swears by the altar is bound by nothing

 such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now
 no
 and never will be. ","And if those days had not been cut short
 no one would be saved; but for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short. ","Then if anyone says to you
 \u2018Look! Here is the Messiah!\u2019 or \u2018There he is!\u2019\u2014do not believe it. ","For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and produce great signs and omens

 so will be the coming of the Son of Man. ","Wherever the corpse is
 there the vultures will gather.","\u201cImmediately after the suffering of those days the sun will be darkened
 and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from heaven
 and the powers of heaven will be shaken.","Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven
 and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn
 and they will see \u2018the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven\u2019 with power and great glory. ","And he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call
 and they will gather his elect from the four winds
 from one end of heaven to the other.","\u201cFrom the fig tree learn its lesson: as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts forth its leaves
 you know that summer is near. ","So also
 when you see all these things
 you know that he is near
 at the very gates. ","Truly I tell you
 this generation will not pass away until all these things have taken place. ","Heaven and earth will pass away
 but my words will not pass away.","\u201cBut about that day and hour no one knows
 neither the angels of heaven
 nor the Son
 but only the Father. ","For as the days of Noah were
 so will be the coming of the Son of Man. ","For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking
 marrying and giving in marriage
 until the day Noah entered the ark
 ","and they knew nothing until the flood came and swept them all away
 so too will be the coming of the Son of Man. ","Then two will be in the field; one will be taken and one will be left.","Two women will be grinding meal together; one will be taken and one will be left.","Keep awake therefore
 for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming. ","But understand this: if the owner of the house had known in what part of the night the thief was coming
 he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken into. ","Therefore you also must be ready
 for the Son of Man is coming at an unexpected hour.","\u201cWho then is the faithful and wise slave
 whom his master has put in charge of his household
 to give the other slaves their allowance of food at the proper time? ","Blessed is that slave whom his master will find at work when he arrives.","Truly I tell you
 he will put that one in charge of all his possessions. ","But if that wicked slave says to himself
 \u2018My master is delayed
\u2019 ","and he begins to beat his fellow slaves
 and eats and drinks with drunkards
 ","the master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour that he does not know.","He will cut him in pieces and put him with the hypocrites
 where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.","\u201cThen the kingdom of heaven will be like this. Ten bridesmaids took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom.","Five of them were foolish
 and five were wise. ","When the foolish took their lamps
 they took no oil with them; ","but the wise took flasks of oil with their lamps.","As the bridegroom was delayed
 all of them became drowsy and slept. ","But at midnight there was a shout
 \u2018Look! Here is the bridegroom! Come out to meet him.\u2019 ","Then all those bridesmaids got up and trimmed their lamps.","The foolish said to the wise
 \u2018Give us some of your oil

 \u2018No! there will not be enough for you and for us; you had better go to the dealers and buy some for yourselves.\u2019 ","And while they went to buy it
 the bridegroom came
 and those who were ready went with him into the wedding banquet; and the door was shut. ","Later the other bridesmaids came also
 saying
 \u2018Lord
 lord
 open to us.\u2019 ","But he replied
 \u2018Truly I tell you
 I do not know you.\u2019 ","Keep awake therefore
 for you know neither the day nor the hour.","\u201cFor it is as if a man
 going on a journey
 summoned his slaves and entrusted his property to them; ","to one he gave five talents
 to another two
 to another one
 to each according to his ability. Then he went away. ","The one who had received the five talents went off at once and traded with them

 the one who had the two talents made two more talents. ","But the one who had received the one talent went off and dug a hole in the ground and hid his master\u2019s money.","After a long time the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them.","Then the one who had received the five talents came forward

 saying
 \u2018Master
 you handed over to me two talents; see
 I have made two more talents.\u2019 ","His master said to him

 \u2018Master

 \u2018You wicked and lazy slave! You knew
 did you
 that I reap where I did not sow
 and gather where I did not scatter? ","Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers

 and give it to the one with the ten talents. ","For to all those who have
 more will be given
 and they will have an abundance; but from those who have nothing
 even what they have will be taken away. ","As for this worthless slave
 throw him into the outer darkness
 where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\u2019","\u201cWhen the Son of Man comes in his glory

 aware of this

 \u201cGo into the city to a certain man

 he said
 \u201cTruly I tell you

 \u201cThe one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me. ","The Son of Man goes as it is written of him

 who betrayed him
 said
 \u201cSurely not I

 \u201cYou have said so.\u201d","While they were eating
 Jesus took a loaf of bread

 gave it to the disciples

 \u201cTake

 \u201cDrink from it

 I will never again drink of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father\u2019s kingdom.\u201d","Then Jesus said to them

 I will go ahead of you to Galilee.\u201d ","Jesus said to him

 \u201cSit here while I go over there and pray.\u201d ","Then he said to them
 \u201cI am deeply grieved

 and stay awake with me.\u201d ","And going a little farther
 he threw himself on the ground and prayed
 \u201cMy Father

 \u201cSo
 could you not stay awake with me one hour? ","Stay awake and pray that you may not come into the time of trial; the spirit indeed is willing

 the hour is at hand

 let us be going. See
 my betrayer is at hand.\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cFriend
 do what you are here to do.\u201d Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and arrested him. ","Then Jesus said to him
 \u201cPut your sword back into its place; for all who take the sword will perish by the sword. ","Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father
 and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of angels? ","But how then would the scriptures be fulfilled
 which say it must happen in this way?\u201d ","At that hour Jesus said to the crowds
 \u201cHave you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me as though I were a bandit? Day after day I sat in the temple teaching
 and you did not arrest me. ","But all this has taken place
 so that the scriptures of the prophets may be fulfilled.\u201d Then all the disciples deserted him and fled.","Jesus said to him
 \u201cYou have said so. But I tell you
 From now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven.\u201d","Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said: \u201cBefore the cock crows
 you will deny me three times.\u201d And he went out and wept bitterly.","Now Jesus stood before the governor; and the governor asked him
 \u201cAre you the King of the Jews?\u201d Jesus said

 \u201cGreetings!\u201d And they came to him

 \u201cDo not be afraid; go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me.\u201d","And Jesus came and said to them

 I am with you always

 \u2018Let it be so now; for it is proper for us in this way to fulfil all righteousness.\u2019 Then he consented. ","But he answered

 for your reward is great in heaven
 for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.","\u2018You are the salt of the earth; but if salt has lost its taste
 how can its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything
 but is thrown out and trampled under foot.","\u2018You are the light of the world. A city built on a hill cannot be hidden.","No one after lighting a lamp puts it under the bushel basket
 but on the lampstand
 and it gives light to all in the house. ","In the same way
 let your light shine before others

 until heaven and earth pass away
 not one letter
 not one stroke of a letter
 will pass from the law until all is accomplished. ","Therefore
 whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments
 and teaches others to do the same
 will be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. ","For I tell you
 unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees
 you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.","\u2018You have heard that it was said to those of ancient times
 \u201cYou shall not murder\u201d; and \u201cwhoever murders shall be liable to judgement.\u201d ","But I say to you that if you are angry with a brother or sister
 you will be liable to judgement; and if you insult a brother or sister
 you will be liable to the council; and if you say
 \u201cYou fool\u201d
 you will be liable to the hell of fire. ","So when you are offering your gift at the altar
 if you remember that your brother or sister has something against you
 ","leave your gift there before the altar and go; first be reconciled to your brother or sister
 and then come and offer your gift. ","Come to terms quickly with your accuser while you are on the way to court with him
 or your accuser may hand you over to the judge
 and the judge to the guard
 and you will be thrown into prison. ","Truly I tell you
 you will never get out until you have paid the last penny.","\u2018You have heard that it was said
 \u201cYou shall not commit adultery.\u201d ","But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her in his heart.","If your right eye causes you to sin
 tear it out and throw it away; it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. ","And if your right hand causes you to sin
 cut it off and throw it away; it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to go into hell.","\u2018It was also said
 \u201cWhoever divorces his wife
 let him give her a certificate of divorce.\u201d ","But I say to you that anyone who divorces his wife
 except on the ground of unchastity
 causes her to commit adultery; and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.","\u2018Again
 you have heard that it was said to those of ancient times
 \u201cYou shall not swear falsely
 but carry out the vows you have made to the Lord.\u201d ","But I say to you
 Do not swear at all
 either by heaven
 for it is the throne of God
 ","or by the earth
 for it is his footstool
 or by Jerusalem
 for it is the city of the great King. ","And do not swear by your head
 for you cannot make one hair white or black. ","Let your word be \u201cYes
 Yes\u201d or \u201cNo
 No\u201d; anything more than this comes from the evil one.","\u2018You have heard that it was said
 \u201cAn eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.\u201d ","But I say to you
 Do not resist an evildoer. But if anyone strikes you on the right cheek
 turn the other also; ","and if anyone wants to sue you and take your coat
 give your cloak as well; ","and if anyone forces you to go one mile
 go also the second mile. ","Give to everyone who begs from you
 and do not refuse anyone who wants to borrow from you.","\u2018You have heard that it was said
 \u201cYou shall love your neighbour and hate your enemy.\u201d ","But I say to you
 Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you
 ","so that you may be children of your Father in heaven; for he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good
 and sends rain on the righteous and on the unrighteous. ","For if you love those who love you
 what reward do you have? Do not even the tax-collectors do the same? ","And if you greet only your brothers and sisters
 what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same? ","Be perfect
 therefore
 as your heavenly Father is perfect.","\u2018Beware of practising your piety before others in order to be seen by them; for then you have no reward from your Father in heaven.","\u2018So whenever you give alms
 do not sound a trumpet before you
 as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets
 so that they may be praised by others. Truly I tell you
 they have received their reward. ","But when you give alms
 do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing
 ","so that your alms may be done in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.","\u2018And whenever you pray
 do not be like the hypocrites; for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners
 so that they may be seen by others. Truly I tell you
 they have received their reward. ","But whenever you pray
 go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.","\u2018When you are praying
 do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do; for they think that they will be heard because of their many words. ","Do not be like them
 for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.","\u2018Pray then in this way: Our Father in heaven
 hallowed be your name.","    Your kingdom come. Your will be done
 on earth as it is in heaven.","Give us this day our daily bread.","    And forgive us our debts
 as we also have forgiven our debtors.","    And do not bring us to the time of trial
 but rescue us from the evil one.","For if you forgive others their trespasses
 your heavenly Father will also forgive you; ","but if you do not forgive others
 neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.","\u2018And whenever you fast
 do not look dismal
 like the hypocrites
 for they disfigure their faces so as to show others that they are fasting. Truly I tell you
 they have received their reward. ","But when you fast
 put oil on your head and wash your face
 ","so that your fasting may be seen not by others but by your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.","\u2018Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth
 where moth and rust consume and where thieves break in and steal; ","but store up for yourselves treasures in heaven
 where neither moth nor rust consumes and where thieves do not break in and steal. ","For where your treasure is
 there your heart will be also.","\u2018The eye is the lamp of the body. So
 if your eye is healthy
 your whole body will be full of light; ","but if your eye is unhealthy
 your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light in you is darkness
 how great is the darkness!","\u2018No one can serve two masters; for a slave will either hate the one and love the other
 or be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth.","\u2018Therefore I tell you
 do not worry about your life
 what you will eat or what you will drink
 or about your body
 what you will wear. Is not life more than food
 and the body more than clothing? ","Look at the birds of the air; they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns
 and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? ","And can any of you by worrying add a single hour to your span of life?","And why do you worry about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field
 how they grow; they neither toil nor spin
 ","yet I tell you
 even Solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these. ","But if God so clothes the grass of the field
 which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven
 will he not much more clothe you\u2014you of little faith? ","Therefore do not worry
 saying
 \u201cWhat will we eat?\u201d or \u201cWhat will we drink?\u201d or \u201cWhat will we wear?\u201d ","For it is the Gentiles who strive for all these things; and indeed your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.","But strive first for the kingdom of God and his righteousness
 and all these things will be given to you as well.","\u2018So do not worry about tomorrow
 for tomorrow will bring worries of its own. Today\u2019s trouble is enough for today.","\u2018Do not judge
 so that you may not be judged. ","For with the judgement you make you will be judged
 and the measure you give will be the measure you get. ","Why do you see the speck in your neighbour\u2019s eye
 but do not notice the log in your own eye? ","Or how can you say to your neighbour
 \u201cLet me take the speck out of your eye\u201d
 while the log is in your own eye? ","You hypocrite
 first take the log out of your own eye
 and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your neighbour\u2019s eye.","\u2018Do not give what is holy to dogs; and do not throw your pearls before swine
 or they will trample them under foot and turn and maul you.","\u2018Ask
 and it will be given to you; search
 and you will find; knock
 and the door will be opened for you. ","For everyone who asks receives
 and everyone who searches finds
 and for everyone who knocks
 the door will be opened. ","Is there anyone among you who
 if your child asks for bread
 will give a stone? ","Or if the child asks for a fish
 will give a snake? ","If you then
 who are evil
 know how to give good gifts to your children
 how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask him!","\u2018In everything do to others as you would have them do to you; for this is the law and the prophets.","\u2018Enter through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the road is easy that leads to destruction
 and there are many who take it. ","For the gate is narrow and the road is hard that leads to life
 and there are few who find it.","\u2018Beware of false prophets
 who come to you in sheep\u2019s clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves. ","You will know them by their fruits. Are grapes gathered from thorns
 or figs from thistles? ","In the same way
 every good tree bears good fruit
 but the bad tree bears bad fruit. ","A good tree cannot bear bad fruit
 nor can a bad tree bear good fruit. ","Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.","Thus you will know them by their fruits.","\u2018Not everyone who says to me
 \u201cLord
 Lord\u201d

 but only one who does the will of my Father in heaven. ","On that day many will say to me

 Lord

 he was amazed and said to those who followed him
 \u2018Truly I tell you
 in no one in Israel have I found such faith. ","I tell you
 many will come from east and west and will eat with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven
 ","while the heirs of the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness
 where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\u2019 ","And to the centurion Jesus said
 \u2018Go; let it be done for you according to your faith.\u2019 And the servant was healed in that hour.","And Jesus said to him
 \u2018Foxes have holes
 and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.\u2019 ","But Jesus said to him
 \u2018Follow me
 and let the dead bury their own dead.\u2019","And he said to them
 \u2018Why are you afraid
 you of little faith?\u2019 Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a dead calm. ","And he said to them
 \u2018Go!\u2019 So they came out and entered the swine; and suddenly
 the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and perished in the water. ","And just then some people were carrying a paralysed man lying on a bed. When Jesus saw their faith
 he said to the paralytic
 \u2018Take heart
 son; your sins are forgiven.\u2019 ","But Jesus
 perceiving their thoughts
 said
 \u2018Why do you think evil in your hearts? ","For which is easier
 to say
 \u201cYour sins are forgiven\u201d
 or to say
 \u201cStand up and walk\u201d? ","But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins\u2019\u2014he then said to the paralytic\u2014\u2018Stand up
 take your bed and go to your home.\u2019 ","As Jesus was walking along
 he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax booth; and he said to him
 \u2018Follow me.\u2019 And he got up and followed him.","But when he heard this
 he said
 \u2018Those who are well have no need of a physician

 \u2018The wedding-guests cannot mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them
 can they? The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them

 and seeing her he said
 \u2018Take heart

 \u2018Yes

 \u2018See that no one knows of this.\u2019 ","Then he said to his disciples
 \u2018The harvest is plentiful

 find out who in it is worthy

 greet it. ","If the house is worthy
 let your peace come upon it; but if it is not worthy
 let your peace return to you. ","If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words

 do not worry about how you are to speak or what you are to say; for what you are to say will be given to you at that time; ","for it is not you who speak

 tell in the light; and what you hear whispered
 proclaim from the housetops. ","Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.","Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground unperceived by your Father.","And even the hairs of your head are all counted.","So do not be afraid; you are of more value than many sparrows.","\u2018Everyone therefore who acknowledges me before others
 I also will acknowledge before my Father in heaven; ","but whoever denies me before others
 I also will deny before my Father in heaven.","\u2018Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth; I have not come to bring peace
 but a sword.","For I have come to set a man against his father
 and a daughter against her mother
 and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law;","and one\u2019s foes will be members of one\u2019s own household.","Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me;","and whoever does not take up the cross and follow me is not worthy of me.","Those who find their life will lose it
 and those who lose their life for my sake will find it.","\u2018Whoever welcomes you welcomes me
 and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me. ","Whoever welcomes a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophet\u2019s reward; and whoever welcomes a righteous person in the name of a righteous person will receive the reward of the righteous;","and whoever gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones in the name of a disciple\u2014truly I tell you
 none of these will lose their reward.\u2019","Jesus answered them
 \u2018Go and tell John what you hear and see: ","the blind receive their sight
 the lame walk
 the lepers are cleansed
 the deaf hear
 the dead are raised
 and the poor have good news brought to them. ","And blessed is anyone who takes no offence at me.\u2019","As they went away
 Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: \u2018What did you go out into the wilderness to look at? A reed shaken by the wind? ","What then did you go out to see? Someone dressed in soft robes? Look
 those who wear soft robes are in royal palaces. ","What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes
 I tell you
 and more than a prophet. ","This is the one about whom it is written
 \u201cSee
 I am sending my messenger ahead of you
 who will prepare your way before you.\u201d","Truly I tell you
 among those born of women no one has arisen greater than John the Baptist; yet the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. ","From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has suffered violence
 and the violent take it by force. ","For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John came;","and if you are willing to accept it
 he is Elijah who is to come. ","Let anyone with ears listen!","\u2018But to what will I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the market-places and calling to one another
","\u201cWe played the flute for you
 and you did not dance; we wailed
 and you did not mourn.\u201d","For John came neither eating nor drinking
 and they say
 \u201cHe has a demon\u201d; ","the Son of Man came eating and drinking
 and they say
 \u201cLook
 a glutton and a drunkard
 a friend of tax-collectors and sinners!\u201d Yet wisdom is vindicated by her deeds.\u2019","Then he began to reproach the cities in which most of his deeds of power had been done
 because they did not repent. ","\u2018Woe to you
 Chorazin! Woe to you
 Bethsaida! For if the deeds of power done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon
 they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. ","But I tell you
 on the day of judgement it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon than for you. ","And you
 Capernaum
 will you be exalted to heaven? No
 you will be brought down to Hades. For if the deeds of power done in you had been done in Sodom
 it would have remained until this day. ","But I tell you that on the day of judgement it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom than for you.\u2019","At that time Jesus said
 \u2018I thank you
 Father
 Lord of heaven and earth
 because you have hidden these things from the wise and the intelligent and have revealed them to infants; ","yes
 Father
 for such was your gracious will. ","All things have been handed over to me by my Father; and no one knows the Son except the Father
 and no one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.","\u2018Come to me
 all you that are weary and are carrying heavy burdens
 and I will give you rest. ","Take my yoke upon you
 and learn from me; for I am gentle and humble in heart
 and you will find rest for your souls. ","For my yoke is easy
 and my burden is light.\u2019","He said to them
 \u2018Have you not read what David did when he and his companions were hungry? ","He entered the house of God and ate the bread of the Presence
 which it was not lawful for him or his companions to eat
 but only for the priests. ","Or have you not read in the law that on the sabbath the priests in the temple break the sabbath and yet are guiltless?","I tell you
 something greater than the temple is here. ","But if you had known what this means
 \u201cI desire mercy and not sacrifice\u201d
 you would not have condemned the guiltless. ","For the Son of Man is lord of the sabbath.\u2019","He said to them
 \u2018Suppose one of you has only one sheep and it falls into a pit on the sabbath; will you not lay hold of it and lift it out? ","How much more valuable is a human being than a sheep! So it is lawful to do good on the sabbath.\u2019","Then he said to the man
 \u2018Stretch out your hand.\u2019 He stretched it out
 and it was restored
 as sound as the other. ","He knew what they were thinking and said to them
 \u2018Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste
 and no city or house divided against itself will stand. ","If Satan casts out Satan
 he is divided against himself; how then will his kingdom stand? ","If I cast out demons by Beelzebul
 by whom do your own exorcists cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges. ","But if it is by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons
 then the kingdom of God has come to you. ","Or how can one enter a strong man\u2019s house and plunder his property
 without first tying up the strong man? Then indeed the house can be plundered. ","Whoever is not with me is against me
 and whoever does not gather with me scatters. ","Therefore I tell you
 people will be forgiven for every sin and blasphemy
 but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. ","Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven
 but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven
 either in this age or in the age to come.","\u2018Either make the tree good
 and its fruit good; or make the tree bad
 and its fruit bad; for the tree is known by its fruit. ","You brood of vipers! How can you speak good things
 when you are evil? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. ","The good person brings good things out of a good treasure
 and the evil person brings evil things out of an evil treasure. ","I tell you
 on the day of judgement you will have to give an account for every careless word you utter; ","for by your words you will be justified
 and by your words you will be condemned.\u2019","But he answered them
 \u2018An evil and adulterous generation asks for a sign
 but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. ","For just as Jonah was for three days and three nights in the belly of the sea monster
 so for three days and three nights the Son of Man will be in the heart of the earth. ","The people of Nineveh will rise up at the judgement with this generation and condemn it
 because they repented at the proclamation of Jonah
 and see
 something greater than Jonah is here! ","The queen of the South will rise up at the judgement with this generation and condemn it
 because she came from the ends of the earth to listen to the wisdom of Solomon
 and see
 something greater than Solomon is here!","\u2018When the unclean spirit has gone out of a person
 it wanders through waterless regions looking for a resting-place
 but it finds none. ","Then it says
 \u201cI will return to my house from which I came.\u201d When it comes
 it finds it empty
 swept
 and put in order. ","Then it goes and brings along seven other spirits more evil than itself
 and they enter and live there; and the last state of that person is worse than the first. So will it be also with this evil generation.\u2019","While he was still speaking to the crowds
 his mother and his brothers were standing outside
 wanting to speak to him. ","But to the one who had told him this
 Jesus replied
 \u2018Who is my mother
 and who are my brothers?\u2019 ","And pointing to his disciples
 he said
 \u2018Here are my mother and my brothers! ","For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.\u2019","And he told them many things in parables
 saying: \u2018Listen! A sower went out to sow. ","And as he sowed
 some seeds fell on the path
 and the birds came and ate them up. ","Other seeds fell on rocky ground
 where they did not have much soil
 and they sprang up quickly
 since they had no depth of soil. ","But when the sun rose
 they were scorched; and since they had no root
 they withered away. ","Other seeds fell among thorns
 and the thorns grew up and choked them. ","Other seeds fell on good soil and brought forth grain
 some a hundredfold
 some sixty
 some thirty. ","Let anyone with ears listen!\u2019","He answered
 \u2018To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven
 but to them it has not been given. ","For to those who have
 more will be given
 and they will have an abundance; but from those who have nothing
 even what they have will be taken away. ","The reason I speak to them in parables is that \u201cseeing they do not perceive
 and hearing they do not listen
 nor do they understand.\u201d ","With them indeed is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah that says: \u201cYou will indeed listen
 but never understand
 and you will indeed look
 but never perceive.","For this people\u2019s heart has grown dull
 and their ears are hard of hearing
 and they have shut their eyes; so that they might not look with their eyes
 and listen with their ears
 and understand with their heart and turn\u2014 and I would heal them.\u201d","But blessed are your eyes
 for they see
 and your ears
 for they hear. ","Truly I tell you
 many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see
 but did not see it
 and to hear what you hear
 but did not hear it.","\u2018Hear then the parable of the sower.","When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it
 the evil one comes and snatches away what is sown in the heart; this is what was sown on the path. ","As for what was sown on rocky ground
 this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy; ","yet such a person has no root
 but endures only for a while
 and when trouble or persecution arises on account of the word
 that person immediately falls away. ","As for what was sown among thorns
 this is the one who hears the word
 but the cares of the world and the lure of wealth choke the word
 and it yields nothing. ","But as for what was sown on good soil
 this is the one who hears the word and understands it
 who indeed bears fruit and yields
 in one case a hundredfold
 in another sixty
 and in another thirty.\u2019","He put before them another parable: \u2018The kingdom of heaven may be compared to someone who sowed good seed in his field;","but while everybody was asleep
 an enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat
 and then went away. ","So when the plants came up and bore grain
 then the weeds appeared as well. ","And the slaves of the householder came and said to him
 \u201cMaster
 did you not sow good seed in your field? Where
 then
 did these weeds come from?\u201d ","He answered
 \u201cAn enemy has done this.\u201d The slaves said to him
 \u201cThen do you want us to go and gather them?\u201d ","But he replied
 \u201cNo; for in gathering the weeds you would uproot the wheat along with them. ","Let both of them grow together until the harvest; and at harvest time I will tell the reapers
 Collect the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned
 but gather the wheat into my barn.\u201d\u2019","He put before them another parable: \u2018The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that someone took and sowed in his field;","it is the smallest of all the seeds
 but when it has grown it is the greatest of shrubs and becomes a tree
 so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches.\u2019","He told them another parable: \u2018The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed in with three measures of flour until all of it was leavened.\u2019","He answered
 \u2018The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man; ","the field is the world
 and the good seed are the children of the kingdom; the weeds are the children of the evil one
 ","and the enemy who sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the age
 and the reapers are angels. ","Just as the weeds are collected and burned up with fire
 so will it be at the end of the age. ","The Son of Man will send his angels
 and they will collect out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all evildoers
 ","and they will throw them into the furnace of fire
 where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. ","Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Let anyone with ears listen!","\u2018The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field
 which someone found and hid; then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.","\u2018Again
 the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls; ","on finding one pearl of great value
 he went and sold all that he had and bought it.","\u2018Again
 the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea and caught fish of every kind; ","when it was full
 they drew it ashore
 sat down
 and put the good into baskets but threw out the bad. ","So it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come out and separate the evil from the righteous","and throw them into the furnace of fire
 where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.","\u2018Have you understood all this?\u2019 They answered
 \u2018Yes.\u2019 ","And he said to them
 \u2018Therefore every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a household who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old.\u2019 ","And they took offence at him. But Jesus said to them
 \u2018Prophets are not without honour except in their own country and in their own house.\u2019 ","Jesus said to them
 \u2018They need not go away; you give them something to eat.\u2019 ","And he said
 \u2018Bring them here to me.\u2019 ","But immediately Jesus spoke to them and said
 \u2018Take heart
 it is I; do not be afraid.\u2019","He said
 \u2018Come.\u2019 So Peter got out of the boat
 started walking on the water
 and came towards Jesus. ","Jesus immediately reached out his hand and caught him
 saying to him
 \u2018You of little faith
 why did you doubt?\u2019 ","He answered them
 \u2018And why do you break the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition? ","For God said
 \u201cHonour your father and your mother
\u201d and
 \u201cWhoever speaks evil of father or mother must surely die.\u201d ","But you say that whoever tells father or mother
 \u201cWhatever support you might have had from me is given to God\u201d
 then that person need not honour the father. ","So
 for the sake of your tradition
 you make void the word of God. ","You hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied rightly about you when he said:","\u201cThis people honours me with their lips
 but their hearts are far from me;","in vain do they worship me
 teaching human precepts as doctrines.\u201d\u2019","Then he called the crowd to him and said to them
 \u2018Listen and understand: ","it is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person
 but it is what comes out of the mouth that defiles.\u2019 ","He answered
 \u2018Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted. ","Let them alone; they are blind guides of the blind. And if one blind person guides another
 both will fall into a pit.\u2019 ","Then he said
 \u2018Are you also still without understanding? ","Do you not see that whatever goes into the mouth enters the stomach
 and goes out into the sewer? ","But what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart
 and this is what defiles. ","For out of the heart come evil intentions
 murder
 adultery
 fornication
 theft
 false witness
 slander. ","These are what defile a person
 but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile.\u2019","He answered
 \u2018I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\u2019 ","He answered
 \u2018It is not fair to take the children\u2019s food and throw it to the dogs.\u2019 ","Then Jesus answered her
 \u2018Woman
 great is your faith! Let it be done for you as you wish.\u2019 And her daughter was healed instantly.","Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said
 \u2018I have compassion for the crowd
 because they have been with me now for three days and have nothing to eat; and I do not want to send them away hungry
 for they might faint on the way.\u2019 ","Jesus asked them
 \u2018How many loaves have you?\u2019 They said
 \u2018Seven
 and a few small fish.\u2019 ","He answered them
 \u2018When it is evening
 you say
 \u201cIt will be fair weather
 for the sky is red.\u201d ","And in the morning
 \u201cIt will be stormy today
 for the sky is red and threatening.\u201d You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky
 but you cannot interpret the signs of the times. ","An evil and adulterous generation asks for a sign
 but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah.\u2019 Then he left them and went away.","Jesus said to them
 \u2018Watch out
 and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\u2019 ","And becoming aware of it
 Jesus said
 \u2018You of little faith
 why are you talking about having no bread? ","Do you still not perceive? Do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand
 and how many baskets you gathered? ","Or the seven loaves for the four thousand
 and how many baskets you gathered? ","How could you fail to perceive that I was not speaking about bread? Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees!\u2019","Now when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi
 he asked his disciples
 \u2018Who do people say that the Son of Man is?\u2019 ","He said to them
 \u2018But who do you say that I am?\u2019 ","And Jesus answered him
 \u2018Blessed are you
 Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you
 but my Father in heaven. ","And I tell you
 you are Peter
 and on this rock I will build my church
 and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it. ","I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven
 and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven
 and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.\u2019 ","But he turned and said to Peter
 \u2018Get behind me
 Satan! You are a stumbling-block to me; for you are setting your mind not on divine things but on human things.\u2019","Then Jesus told his disciples
 \u2018If any want to become my followers
 let them deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me. ","For those who want to save their life will lose it
 and those who lose their life for my sake will find it. ","For what will it profit them if they gain the whole world but forfeit their life? Or what will they give in return for their life?","\u2018For the Son of Man is to come with his angels in the glory of his Father
 and then he will repay everyone for what has been done. ","Truly I tell you
 there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.\u2019","But Jesus came and touched them
 saying
 \u2018Get up and do not be afraid.\u2019 ","As they were coming down the mountain
 Jesus ordered them
 \u2018Tell no one about the vision until after the Son of Man has been raised from the dead.\u2019 ","He replied
 \u2018Elijah is indeed coming and will restore all things; ","but I tell you that Elijah has already come
 and they did not recognize him
 but they did to him whatever they pleased. So also the Son of Man is about to suffer at their hands.\u2019 ","Jesus answered
 \u2018You faithless and perverse generation
 how much longer must I be with you? How much longer must I put up with you? Bring him here to me.\u2019 ","He said to them
 \u2018Because of your little faith. For truly I tell you
 if you have faith the size of a mustard seed
 you will say to this mountain
 \u201cMove from here to there\u201d
 and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you.\u2019","As they were gathering in Galilee
 Jesus said to them
 \u2018The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into human hands
 ","and they will kill him
 and on the third day he will be raised.\u2019 And they were greatly distressed.","He said
 \u2018Yes
 he does.\u2019 And when he came home
 Jesus spoke of it first
 asking
 \u2018What do you think
 Simon? From whom do kings of the earth take toll or tribute? From their children or from others?\u2019 ","When Peter said
 \u2018From others\u2019
 Jesus said to him
 \u2018Then the children are free. ","However
 so that we do not give offence to them
 go to the lake and cast a hook; take the first fish that comes up; and when you open its mouth
 you will find a coin; take that and give it to them for you and me.\u2019","and said
 \u2018Truly I tell you
 unless you change and become like children
 you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. ","Whoever becomes humble like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.","Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me.","\u2018If any of you put a stumbling-block before one of these little ones who believe in me
 it would be better for you if a great millstone were fastened around your neck and you were drowned in the depth of the sea. ","Woe to the world because of stumbling-blocks! Occasions for stumbling are bound to come
 but woe to the one by whom the stumbling-block comes!","\u2018If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble
 cut it off and throw it away; it is better for you to enter life maimed or lame than to have two hands or two feet and to be thrown into the eternal fire. ","And if your eye causes you to stumble
 tear it out and throw it away; it is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and to be thrown into the hell of fire.","\u2018Take care that you do not despise one of these little ones; for
 I tell you
 in heaven their angels continually see the face of my Father in heaven. ","What do you think? If a shepherd has a hundred sheep
 and one of them has gone astray
 does he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go in search of the one that went astray? ","And if he finds it
 truly I tell you
 he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that never went astray. ","So it is not the will of your Father in heaven that one of these little ones should be lost.","\u2018If another member of the church sins against you
 go and point out the fault when the two of you are alone. If the member listens to you
 you have regained that one. ","But if you are not listened to
 take one or two others along with you
 so that every word may be confirmed by the evidence of two or three witnesses. ","If the member refuses to listen to them
 tell it to the church; and if the offender refuses to listen even to the church
 let such a one be to you as a Gentile and a tax-collector. ","Truly I tell you
 whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven
 and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven. ","Again
 truly I tell you
 if two of you agree on earth about anything you ask
 it will be done for you by my Father in heaven. ","For where two or three are gathered in my name
 I am there among them.\u2019","Jesus said to him
 \u2018Not seven times
 but
 I tell you
 seventy-seven times.","\u2018For this reason the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his slaves.","When he began the reckoning
 one who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him; ","and
 as he could not pay
 his lord ordered him to be sold
 together with his wife and children and all his possessions
 and payment to be made. ","So the slave fell on his knees before him
 saying
 \u201cHave patience with me
 and I will pay you everything.\u201d ","And out of pity for him
 the lord of that slave released him and forgave him the debt. ","But that same slave
 as he went out
 came upon one of his fellow-slaves who owed him a hundred denarii; and seizing him by the throat
 he said
 \u201cPay what you owe.\u201d ","Then his fellow-slave fell down and pleaded with him
 \u201cHave patience with me
 and I will pay you.\u201d ","But he refused; then he went and threw him into prison until he should pay the debt.","When his fellow-slaves saw what had happened
 they were greatly distressed
 and they went and reported to their lord all that had taken place. ","Then his lord summoned him and said to him
 \u201cYou wicked slave! I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me. ","Should you not have had mercy on your fellow-slave
 as I had mercy on you?\u201d ","And in anger his lord handed him over to be tortured until he should pay his entire debt.","So my heavenly Father will also do to every one of you
 if you do not forgive your brother or sister from your heart.\u2019","He answered
 \u2018Have you not read that the one who made them at the beginning \u201cmade them male and female\u201d
 ","and said
 \u201cFor this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife
 and the two shall become one flesh\u201d? ","So they are no longer two
 but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together
 let no one separate.\u2019 ","He said to them
 \u2018It was because you were so hard-hearted that Moses allowed you to divorce your wives
 but at the beginning it was not so. ","And I say to you
 whoever divorces his wife
 except for unchastity
 and marries another commits adultery.\u2019","But he said to them
 \u2018Not everyone can accept this teaching
 but only those to whom it is given. ","For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth
 and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others
 and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let anyone accept this who can.\u2019","but Jesus said
 \u2018Let the little children come to me
 and do not stop them; for it is to such as these that the kingdom of heaven belongs.\u2019 ","And he said to him
 \u2018Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good. If you wish to enter into life
 keep the commandments.\u2019 ","He said to him
 \u2018Which ones?\u2019 And Jesus said
 \u2018You shall not murder; You shall not commit adultery; You shall not steal; You shall not bear false witness; ","Honour your father and mother; also
 You shall love your neighbour as yourself.\u2019 ","Jesus said to him
 \u2018If you wish to be perfect
 go
 sell your possessions
 and give the money to the poor
 and you will have treasure in heaven; then come
 follow me.\u2019 ","Then Jesus said to his disciples
 \u2018Truly I tell you
 it will be hard for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven. ","Again I tell you
 it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.\u2019 ","But Jesus looked at them and said
 \u2018For mortals it is impossible
 but for God all things are possible.\u2019","Jesus said to them
 \u2018Truly I tell you
 at the renewal of all things
 when the Son of Man is seated on the throne of his glory
 you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones
 judging the twelve tribes of Israel. ","And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields
 for my name\u2019s sake
 will receive a hundredfold
 and will inherit eternal life. ","But many who are first will be last
 and the last will be first.","\u2018For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire labourers for his vineyard.","After agreeing with the labourers for the usual daily wage
 he sent them into his vineyard. ","When he went out about nine o\u2019clock
 he saw others standing idle in the market-place; ","and he said to them
 \u201cYou also go into the vineyard
 and I will pay you whatever is right.\u201d So they went. ","When he went out again about noon and about three o\u2019clock
 he did the same. ","And about five o\u2019clock he went out and found others standing around; and he said to them
 \u201cWhy are you standing here idle all day?\u201d ","They said to him
 \u201cBecause no one has hired us.\u201d He said to them
 \u201cYou also go into the vineyard.\u201d ","When evening came
 the owner of the vineyard said to his manager
 \u201cCall the labourers and give them their pay
 beginning with the last and then going to the first.\u201d ","When those hired about five o\u2019clock came
 each of them received the usual daily wage. ","Now when the first came
 they thought they would receive more; but each of them also received the usual daily wage. ","And when they received it

 ","saying
 \u201cThese last worked only one hour

 you did not change your minds and believe him.","\u2018Listen to another parable. There was a landowner who planted a vineyard
 put a fence around it
 dug a wine press in it
 and built a watch-tower. Then he leased it to tenants and went to another country. ","When the harvest time had come
 he sent his slaves to the tenants to collect his produce. ","But the tenants seized his slaves and beat one

 more than the first; and they treated them in the same way. ","Finally he sent his son to them

 \u201cThey will respect my son.\u201d ","But when the tenants saw the son
 they said to themselves
 \u201cThis is the heir; come
 let us kill him and get his inheritance.\u201d ","So they seized him
 threw him out of the vineyard

 what will he do to those tenants?\u2019 ","They said to him
 \u2018He will put those wretches to a miserable death

 I have prepared my dinner

 one to his farm
 another to his business

 \u201cThe wedding is ready

 both good and bad; so the wedding hall was filled with guests.","\u2018But when the king came in to see the guests
 he noticed a man there who was not wearing a wedding robe

 \u201cBind him hand and foot

 aware of their malice

 \u2018You are wrong

 such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now
 no
 and never will be. ","And if those days had not been cut short
 no one would be saved; but for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short. ","Then if anyone says to you
 \u201cLook! Here is the Messiah!\u201d or \u201cThere he is!\u201d\u2014do not believe it. ","For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and produce great signs and omens
 to lead astray
 if possible
 even the elect. ","Take note
 I have told you beforehand. ","So
 if they say to you
 \u201cLook! He is in the wilderness\u201d
 do not go out. If they say
 \u201cLook! He is in the inner rooms\u201d
 do not believe it. ","For as the lightning comes from the east and flashes as far as the west
 so will be the coming of the Son of Man. ","Wherever the corpse is
 there the vultures will gather.","\u2018Immediately after the suffering of those days the sun will be darkened
 and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from heaven
 and the powers of heaven will be shaken.","Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven
 and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn
 and they will see \u201cthe Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven\u201d with power and great glory. ","And he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call
 and they will gather his elect from the four winds
 from one end of heaven to the other.","\u2018From the fig tree learn its lesson: as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts forth its leaves
 you know that summer is near. ","So also
 when you see all these things
 you know that he is near
 at the very gates. ","Truly I tell you
 this generation will not pass away until all these things have taken place. ","Heaven and earth will pass away
 but my words will not pass away.","\u2018But about that day and hour no one knows
 neither the angels of heaven
 nor the Son
 but only the Father. ","For as the days of Noah were
 so will be the coming of the Son of Man. ","For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking
 marrying and giving in marriage
 until the day Noah entered the ark
 ","and they knew nothing until the flood came and swept them all away
 so too will be the coming of the Son of Man. ","Then two will be in the field; one will be taken and one will be left.","Two women will be grinding meal together; one will be taken and one will be left.","Keep awake therefore
 for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming. ","But understand this: if the owner of the house had known in what part of the night the thief was coming
 he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken into. ","Therefore you also must be ready
 for the Son of Man is coming at an unexpected hour.","\u2018Who then is the faithful and wise slave
 whom his master has put in charge of his household
 to give the other slaves their allowance of food at the proper time? ","Blessed is that slave whom his master will find at work when he arrives.","Truly I tell you
 he will put that one in charge of all his possessions. ","But if that wicked slave says to himself
 \u201cMy master is delayed\u201d
 ","and he begins to beat his fellow-slaves
 and eats and drinks with drunkards
 ","the master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour that he does not know.","He will cut him in pieces and put him with the hypocrites
 where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.","\u2018Then the kingdom of heaven will be like this. Ten bridesmaids took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom.","Five of them were foolish
 and five were wise. ","When the foolish took their lamps
 they took no oil with them; ","but the wise took flasks of oil with their lamps.","As the bridegroom was delayed
 all of them became drowsy and slept. ","But at midnight there was a shout
 \u201cLook! Here is the bridegroom! Come out to meet him.\u201d ","Then all those bridesmaids got up and trimmed their lamps.","The foolish said to the wise
 \u201cGive us some of your oil

 \u201cNo! there will not be enough for you and for us; you had better go to the dealers and buy some for yourselves.\u201d ","And while they went to buy it
 the bridegroom came
 and those who were ready went with him into the wedding banquet; and the door was shut. ","Later the other bridesmaids came also
 saying
 \u201cLord
 lord
 open to us.\u201d ","But he replied
 \u201cTruly I tell you
 I do not know you.\u201d ","Keep awake therefore
 for you know neither the day nor the hour.","\u2018For it is as if a man
 going on a journey
 summoned his slaves and entrusted his property to them; ","to one he gave five talents
 to another two
 to another one
 to each according to his ability. Then he went away. ","The one who had received the five talents went off at once and traded with them
 and made five more talents. ","In the same way
 the one who had the two talents made two more talents. ","But the one who had received the one talent went off and dug a hole in the ground and hid his master\u2019s money.","After a long time the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them.","Then the one who had received the five talents came forward
 bringing five more talents

 good and trustworthy slave; you have been trustworthy in a few things

 \u201cMaster
 I knew that you were a harsh man
 reaping where you did not sow
 and gathering where you did not scatter seed; ","so I was afraid

 \u201cYou wicked and lazy slave! You knew
 did you
 that I reap where I did not sow
 and gather where I did not scatter? ","Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers
 and on my return I would have received what was my own with interest. ","So take the talent from him
 and give it to the one with the ten talents. ","For to all those who have
 more will be given
 and they will have an abundance; but from those who have nothing
 even what they have will be taken away. ","As for this worthless slave
 throw him into the outer darkness
 where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\u201d","\u2018When the Son of Man comes in his glory

 \u2018All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. ","Go therefore and make disciples of all nations

 ","\u2018The Bible says\u2019
 replied Jesus
 \u2018that it takes more than bread to keep you alive. You actually live on every word that comes out of God\u2019s mouth.\u2019","\u2018But the Bible also says\u2019
 replied Jesus
 \u2018that you mustn\u2019t put the Lord your God to the test!\u2019","\u2018Get out of it

 when people slander you and persecute you
 and say all kinds of wicked things about you falsely because of me! ","Celebrate and rejoice: there\u2019s a great reward for you in heaven. That\u2019s how they persecuted the prophets who went before you.\u2019","\u2018You\u2019re the salt of the earth! But if the salt becomes tasteless
 how is it going to get salty again? It\u2019s no good for anything. You might as well throw it out and walk all over it.","\u2018You\u2019re the light of the world! A city can\u2019t be hidden if it\u2019s on top of a hill.","People don\u2019t light a lamp and put it under a bucket; they put it on a lampstand. Then it gives light to everybody in the house.","That\u2019s how you must shine your light in front of people! Then they will see what wonderful things you do
 and they\u2019ll give glory to your father in heaven.","\u2018Don\u2019t suppose that I came to destroy the law or the prophets. I didn\u2019t come to destroy them; I came to fulfil them!","I\u2019m telling you the truth: until heaven and earth disappear
 not one stroke
 not one dot
 is going to disappear from the law
 until it\u2019s all come true. ","So anyone who relaxes a single one of these commandments
 even the little ones
 and teaches that to people
 will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. But anyone who does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.","\u2018Yes
 let me tell you: unless your covenant behaviour is far superior to that of the scribes and Pharisees
 you will never get in to the kingdom of heaven.\u2019","\u2018You heard that it was said to the ancient people
 \u201cYou shall not murder\u201d; and anyone who commits murder shall be liable to judgment. ","But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be liable to judgment; anyone who uses foul and abusive language will be liable to the lawcourt; and anyone who says
 \u201cYou fool\u201d
 will be liable to the fires of Gehenna.","\u2018So
 if you are coming to the altar with your gift
 and there you remember that your brother has a grievance against you
 ","leave your gift right there in front of the altar
 and go first and be reconciled to your brother. Then come back and offer your gift. ","Make friends with your opponent quickly
 while you are with him in the street
 in case your opponent hands you over to the judge

 \u201cIf someone divorces his wife
 he should give her a legal document to prove it.\u201d ","But I say to you: everyone who divorces his wife
 unless it\u2019s in connection with immorality
 makes her commit adultery; and anyone who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.","\u2018Again
 you heard that it was said to the people long ago: \u201cYou shall not swear falsely
 but you shall give to the Lord what you promised under oath.\u201d ","But I say to you: don\u2019t swear at all! Don\u2019t swear by heaven (it\u2019s God\u2019s throne!);","don\u2019t swear by the earth (it\u2019s God\u2019s footstool!); don\u2019t swear by Jerusalem (it\u2019s the city of the great king!);","don\u2019t swear by your head (you can\u2019t make one hair of it turn white or black!).","When you\u2019re talking

 go a second one with him. ","Give to anyone who asks you

 \u201cLove your neighbour and hate your enemy.\u201d ","But I tell you: love your enemies! Pray for people who persecute you!","That way
 you\u2019ll be children of your father in heaven! After all
 he makes his sun rise on bad and good alike
 and sends rain both on the upright and on the unjust. ","Look at it like this: if you love those who love you
 do you expect a special reward? Even tax-collectors do that
 don\u2019t they? ","And if you only greet your own family
 what\u2019s so special about that? Even Gentiles do that

 just as your heavenly father is perfect.\u2019","\u2018When you are practising your piety
 mind you don\u2019t do it with an eye on the audience! Otherwise

 don\u2019t sound a trumpet in front of you. That\u2019s what people do when they\u2019re just play-acting
 in the synagogues and the streets. They do it so that people will be impressed at them. I\u2019m telling you the truth: they\u2019ve received their reward in full. ","No: when you give money
 don\u2019t let your left hand have any idea what your right hand is up to. ","That way
 your giving will be in secret. And your father
 who sees in secret
 will repay you.","\u2018When you pray
 you mustn\u2019t be like the play-actors. They love to pray standing in the synagogues and on street corners
 so that people will notice them. I\u2019m telling you the truth: they have received their reward in full. ","No: when you pray
 go into your own room
 shut the door

 don\u2019t pile up a jumbled heap of words! That\u2019s what the Gentiles do. They reckon that the more they say
 the more likely they are to be heard. ","So don\u2019t be like them. You see
 your father knows what you need before you ask him.","\u2018So this is how you should pray: Our father in heaven
 may your name be honoured","may your kingdom come may your will be done as in heaven
 so on earth.","Give us today the bread we need now;","and forgive us the things we owe
 as we too have forgiven what was owed to us.","Don\u2019t bring us into the great trial
 but rescue us from evil.","\u2018Yes: if you forgive people the wrong they have done
 your heavenly father will forgive you as well. ","But if you don\u2019t forgive people
 neither will your heavenly father forgive you what you have done wrong.\u2019","\u2018When you fast
 don\u2019t be gloomy like the play-actors. They make their faces quite unrecognizable
 so that everyone can see they\u2019re fasting. I\u2019m telling you the truth: they have received their reward in full. ","No: when you fast
 tidy your hair and beard the way you normally do
 and wash your face
 ","so that others won\u2019t notice you\u2019re fasting\u00a0\u2013 except your father
 privately. Then your father
 who sees in private
 will repay you.","\u2018Don\u2019t store up treasure on earth. Moths and rust will eat it away
 and robbers will break in and steal it. ","No: store up for yourselves treasure in heaven! Moths and rust don\u2019t eat it away there
 and no robbers break in and steal it. ","Show me your treasure
 and I\u2019ll show you where your heart is.","\u2018The eye is the lamp of the body. So if your eye is honest and clear
 your whole body will be full of light. ","But if your eye is evil
 your whole body is in the dark. So
 if the light within you turns out to be darkness
 darkness doesn\u2019t come any darker than that.","\u2018Nobody can serve two masters. Otherwise
 they will either hate the first and love the second
 or be devoted to the first and despise the second. You can\u2019t serve both God and wealth.\u2019","\u2018So let me tell you: don\u2019t worry about your life\u00a0\u2013 what to eat
 what to drink; don\u2019t worry about your body\u00a0\u2013 what to wear. There\u2019s more to life than food! There\u2019s more to the body than a suit of clothes! ","Have a good look at the birds in the sky. They don\u2019t plant seeds

 and then you\u2019ll see clearly enough to take the splinter out of your neighbour\u2019s eye.","\u2018Don\u2019t give holy things to dogs. Don\u2019t throw your pearls to pigs. If you do
 they will trample them under their feet\u00a0\u2013 and then turn round and attack you!\u2019","\u2018Ask and it will be given to you! Search and you will find!

Supposing your son asks you for bread\u00a0\u2013 which of you is going to give him a stone?","Or if he asks for a fish\u00a0\u2013 which of you is going to give him a serpent?","Well then: if you know how to give good gifts to your children
 evil as you are
 how much more will your father in heaven give good things to those who ask him!","\u2018So whatever you want people to do to you
 do just that to them. Yes; this is what the law and the prophets are all about.\u2019","\u2018Go in by the narrow gate. The gate that leads to destruction

 I\u2019m sending my messenger ahead of you and he will clear your path before you.","\u2018I\u2019m telling you the truth: John the Baptist is the greatest mother\u2019s son there ever was. But even the least significant person in heaven\u2019s kingdom is greater than he is.","From the time of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has been forcing its way in\u00a0\u2013 and the men of force are trying to grab it!","All the prophets and the law
 you see
 made their prophecies up to the time of John. ","In fact
 if you\u2019ll believe it
 he is Elijah
 the one who was to come. ","If you\u2019ve got ears
 then listen!\u2019","\u2018What picture shall I give you for this generation?\u2019 asked Jesus. \u2018It\u2019s like a bunch of children sitting in the town square
 and singing songs to each other. ","This is how it goes: You didn\u2019t dance when we played the flute
 you didn\u2019t cry when we sang the dirge!","\u2018What do I mean? When John appeared
 he didn\u2019t have any normal food or drink\u00a0\u2013 and people said \u201cWhat\u2019s got into him
 then? Some demon?\u201d ","Then along comes the son of man
 eating and drinking normally
 and people say
 \u201cOoh
 look at him\u00a0\u2013 guzzling and boozing
 hanging around with tax-collectors and other riff-raff.\u201d But
 you know
 wisdom is as wisdom does\u00a0\u2013 and wisdom will be vindicated!\u2019","Then he began to berate the towns where he\u2019d done most of his powerful deeds
 because they hadn\u2019t repented.","\u2018A curse on you
 Chorazin!\u2019 he said. \u2018A curse on you
 Bethsaida! If Tyre and Sidon had seen the kind of powerful things you saw
 they would have repented long ago with hairshirts and ashes. ","But I can tell you this: on the day of judgment Tyre and Sidon will have a better time of it than you will.","And what about you
 Capernaum? You think you\u2019re going to be exalted to heaven
 do you? No\u00a0\u2013 you\u2019ll be sent down to Hades! If the powerful works that happened in you had happened in Sodom
 it would still be standing today. ","But I can tell you this: on the day of judgment the land of Sodom will have a better time of it than you will!\u2019","At that time Jesus turned to God with this prayer: \u2018I give you my praise
 father
 Lord of heaven and earth! You hid these things from the wise and intelligent and revealed them to children! ","Yes
 father
 that\u2019s the way you decided to do it! ","My father gave me everything: nobody knows the son except the father
 and nobody knows the father except the son\u00a0\u2013 and anyone the son wants to reveal him to.","\u2018Are you having a real struggle? Come to me! Are you carrying a big load on your back? Come to me\u00a0\u2013 I\u2019ll give you a rest!","Pick up my yoke and put it on; take lessons from me! My heart is gentle
 not arrogant. You\u2019ll find the rest you deeply need. ","My yoke is easy to wear
 my load is easy to bear.\u2019","\u2018Did you never read what David did?\u2019 replied Jesus. \u2018When he and his men were hungry
 ","they went into God\u2019s house and ate the holy bread which neither he nor his men were allowed to eat\u00a0\u2013 only the priests had that right.","Or didn\u2019t you read in the law that the priests in the Temple do things on the sabbath which are against sabbath law\u00a0\u2013 and they aren\u2019t guilty?","Let me tell you this: something greater than the Temple is here.","If you\u2019d known what this saying means: Mercy
 not sacrifice
 is what I really want \u2013 you wouldn\u2019t have passed judgment on blameless people. ","Yes
 you see: the son of man is master of the sabbath
 too.\u2019","\u2018Supposing one of you has just one sheep
\u2019 replied Jesus
 \u2018and it falls into a ditch on the sabbath. You\u2019ll grab it and haul it out
 won\u2019t you? ","Well then
 think how much more important a human being is than a sheep! So
 you see
 it is permitted to do good on the sabbath.\u2019","Then he said to the man
 \u2018Stretch your hand out.\u2019 He stretched it out
 and it was restored to health
 just like the other one. ","Jesus knew their thoughts. \u2018Suppose a kingdom is split down the middle
\u2019 he said to them. \u2018It\u2019ll go to rack and ruin! If a city or a household is split down the middle
 it\u2019s doomed!","And if the satan drives out the satan
 he\u2019s split down the middle\u00a0\u2013 so how can his kingdom stay standing?","\u2018What\u2019s more

 then
 God\u2019s kingdom has arrived on your doorstep!","\u2018Look at it like this. Suppose you want to break into a strong man\u2019s house and steal his belongings. How are you going to do that unless you first tie up the strong man? Then you can plunder his house to your heart\u2019s content.","If you\u2019re not with me
 you\u2019re against me. Unless you\u2019re gathering the flock with me
 you\u2019re scattering it.","\u2018So let me tell you this: people will be forgiven for every sin and blasphemy; but blasphemy against the spirit will not be forgiven.","If anyone speaks a word against the son of man
 it will be forgiven. But if anyone speaks a word against the holy spirit
 it won\u2019t be forgiven
 either in the present age or in the age to come.\u2019","\u2018You must make up your mind between two possibilities
\u2019 Jesus went on. \u2018Either the tree is good
 in which case its fruit is good; or the tree is bad
 in which case its fruit is bad. You can tell the tree by its fruits
 after all.","\u2018You\u2019re a family of snakes! How can you say good things when you\u2019re bad inside? What the mouth speaks is what fills the heart.","A good person produces good things from a good storeroom; an evil person produces evil things from an evil storeroom.","Let me tell you this: on judgment day people will have to own up to every trivial word they say.","Yes: you will be vindicated by your own words\u00a0\u2013 and you will be condemned by your own words.\u2019","\u2018This wicked and immoral generation is looking for a sign
\u2019 replied Jesus. \u2018But no sign will be given to it\u00a0\u2013 except the sign of Jonah. ","Jonah
 you see
 was in the stomach of the sea-monster for three days and three nights\u00a0\u2013 and in the same way the son of man will be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights. ","The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment along with this generation and will condemn it. They
 after all
 repented when they heard Jonah\u2019s warnings! And
 in case you hadn\u2019t noticed
 something greater than Jonah is here. ","The Queen of the South will be raised at the judgment with this generation and will condemn it. She
 after all
 came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon! And
 in case you hadn\u2019t noticed
 something greater than Solomon is here.\u2019","\u2018When the unclean spirit goes out of a person
\u2019 Jesus continued
 \u2018it goes wandering through waterless places looking for somewhere to rest
 and doesn\u2019t find anywhere. ","Then it says
 \u201cI\u2019ll go back to my house
 the one I left.\u201d When it gets there it finds it standing empty
 clean and tidy. ","Then it goes out and collects seven other spirits to join it
 spirits worse than itself. They go in and take up residence there. The poor person ends up worse off than they were to start with! And that\u2019s what will happen with this wicked generation.\u2019","Suddenly
 while he was speaking to the crowds
 his mother and his brothers came and stood outside
 hoping for a chance to speak to him.","\u2018Who is my mother?\u2019 said Jesus to the person who had spoken to him. \u2018Who are my brothers?\u2019","Then he stretched out his hand towards his disciples. \u2018Look!\u2019 he said. \u2018Here are my mother and my brothers","Yes; anyone who does what my heavenly father wants is my brother
 and my sister
 and my mother.\u2019","He had much to say to them
 and he said it all in parables. \u2018Listen!\u2019 he said. \u2018Once there was a sower who went out to sow.","As he sowed
 some seed fell beside the path
 and the birds came and ate it up. ","Some seed fell on rocky soil
 where it didn\u2019t have much earth. It sprang up at once because it didn\u2019t have depth of soil. ","But when the sun was high it got scorched
 and it withered because it didn\u2019t have any root. ","Other seed fell in among thorns
 and the thorns grew up and choked it. ","And other seed fell into good soil
 and produced a crop
 some a hundred times over
 some sixty
 and some thirty times over. ","If you\u2019ve got ears
 then listen!\u2019","\u2018You\u2019ve been given the gift of knowing the secrets of the kingdom of heaven
\u2019 he replied
 \u2018but they haven\u2019t been given it. ","Anyone who already has something will be given more
 and they will have plenty. But anyone who has nothing\u00a0\u2013 even what they have will be taken away! ","That\u2019s why I speak to them in parables
 so that they may look but not see
 and hear but not understand or take it in. ","Isaiah\u2019s prophecy is coming true in them: You will listen and listen but won\u2019t understand
 you will look and look but not see.","This people\u2019s heart has gone flabby and fat
 their ears are muffled and dull
 their eyes are darkened and shut; in order that they won\u2019t see with their eyes or hear with their ears
 or know in their heart
 or turn back again for me to restore them. ","But there\u2019s great news for your eyes: they can see! And for your ears: they can hear!","I\u2019m telling you the truth: many prophets and holy people longed to see what you see and didn\u2019t see it
 and to hear what you hear and didn\u2019t hear it.\u2019","\u2018All right
 then
\u2019 Jesus continued
 \u2018this is what the sower story is all about. ","When someone hears the word of the kingdom and doesn\u2019t understand it
 the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in their heart. This corresponds to what was sown beside the path. ","What was sown on rocky ground is the person who hears the word and immediately receives it with delight
 ","but doesn\u2019t have any root of their own. Someone like that only lasts a short time; as soon as there\u2019s any trouble or persecution because of the word
 they trip up at once. ","The one sown among thorns is the one who hears the word
 but the world\u2019s worries and the seduction of wealth choke the word and it doesn\u2019t bear fruit. ","But the one sown on good soil is the one who hears the word and understands it. Someone like that will bear fruit: one will produce a hundred times over
 another sixty
 and another thirty times over.\u2019","He put another parable to them. \u2018The kingdom of heaven\u2019
 he said
 \u2018is like this! Once upon a time a man sowed good seed in his field. ","While the workers were asleep
 his enemy came and sowed weeds in among the wheat
 and went away. ","When the crop came up and produced corn
 then the weeds appeared as well.","\u2018So the farmer\u2019s servants came to him. \u2018\u202f\u201cMaster
\u201d they said
 \u201cdidn\u2019t you sow good seed in your field? Where have the weeds come from?\u201d","\u2018\u202f\u201cThis is the work of an enemy
\u201d he replied. \u2018\u202f\u201cSo
\u201d the servants said to him
 \u201cdo you want us to go and pull them up?\u201d","\u2018\u202f\u201cNo
\u201d he replied. \u201cIf you do that you\u2019ll probably pull up the wheat as well
 while you\u2019re collecting the weeds. ","Let them both grow together until the harvest. Then
 when it\u2019s time for harvest
 I will give the reapers this instruction: \u2018First gather the weeds and tie them up in bundles to burn them
 but gather the wheat into my barn.\u2019\u202f\u201d\u202f\u2019","He put another parable to them. \u2018The kingdom of heaven\u2019
 he said
 \u2018is like a grain of mustard seed
 which someone took and sowed in his field. ","It\u2019s the smallest of all the seeds
 but when it grows it turns into the biggest of the shrubs. It becomes a tree
 and the birds in the sky can then come and nest in its branches.\u2019","He told them another parable. \u2018The kingdom of heaven is like leaven
\u2019 he said
 \u2018which a woman took and hid inside three measures of flour
 until the whole thing was leavened.\u2019","\u2018The one who sows the good seed\u2019
 said Jesus
 \u2018is the son of man. ","The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom. The weeds are the children of the evil one;","the enemy who sowed them is the devil. The harvest is the close of the age
 and the reapers are angels.","\u2018So: when the weeds are gathered and burned in the fire
 that\u2019s what it will be like at the close of the age. ","The son of man will send out his angels
 and they will collect together out of his kingdom everything that causes offence
 and everyone who acts wickedly. ","They will throw them into the fiery furnace
 where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. ","Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their father. If you have ears
 then hear!\u2019","\u2018The kingdom of heaven\u2019
 Jesus continued
 \u2018is like treasure hidden in a field. Someone found it and hid it
 and in great delight went off and sold everything he possessed
 and bought that field.","\u2018Again
 the kingdom of heaven is like a trader who was looking for fine pearls
 ","and who found one that was spectacularly valuable. He went off and sold everything he possessed
 and bought it.","\u2018Again
 the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea
 and collected every type of fish. ","When it was full
 the fishermen brought it to shore. They sat down and selected the good ones
 which they put into a bucket; but they threw out the bad ones. ","That\u2019s what it will be like at the close of the age. The angels will go off and separate the wicked from the righteous
 ","and they will throw them into the fiery furnace
 where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\u2019","\u2018Have you understood all this?\u2019 asked Jesus. \u2018Yes
\u2019 they answered.","\u2018Well
 then
\u2019 he said to them
 \u2018every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings out of his storeroom some new things and some old things.\u2019","They were offended by him. So Jesus said to them
 \u2018No prophet lacks respect \u2013 except in his own town and his own house!\u2019","\u2018They don\u2019t need to go away
\u2019 said Jesus. \u2018You give them something to eat.\u2019","\u2018Bring them here to me
\u2019 he said.","But Jesus at once spoke to them. \u2018Cheer up
\u2019 he said
 \u2018it\u2019s me! Don\u2019t be frightened!\u2019","\u2018Come along
 then
\u2019 said Jesus. Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water and came towards Jesus. ","Jesus at once reached out his hand and caught him. \u2018A fine lot of faith you\u2019ve got!\u2019 he said. \u2018Why did you doubt?\u2019","\u2018Why\u2019
 Jesus replied
 \u2018do you go against the command of God because of your tradition? ","What God said was \u201cHonour your father and mother\u201d and \u201cIf anyone speaks evil of father or mother
 they must certainly die.\u201d ","But you say
 \u201cIf anyone says to father or mother
 \u2018What you might have gained from me is given to God\u2019
 ","they don\u2019t need to honour their father any more.\u201d As a result
 you make God\u2019s word null and void because of your tradition.","\u2018You play-actors! Isaiah had the right words for you in his prophecy:","This people gives me honour with their lips
 their heart
 however
 holds me at arm\u2019s length.","The worship which they offer me is vain
 because they teach
 as law
 mere human precepts.\u2019","Then Jesus called the crowd
 and said to them
 \u2018Listen and understand. ","What makes someone unclean isn\u2019t what goes into the mouth. It\u2019s what comes out of the mouth that makes someone unclean.\u2019","\u2018Every plant that my heavenly father hasn\u2019t planted\u2019
 replied Jesus
 \u2018will be plucked up by the roots. ","Let them be. They are blind guides. But if one blind person guides another
 both of them will fall into a pit.\u2019","\u2018Are you still slow on the uptake as well?\u2019 replied Jesus.","\u2018Don\u2019t you understand that whatever goes into the mouth travels on into the stomach and goes out into the toilet?","But what comes out of the mouth begins in the heart
 and that\u2019s what makes someone unclean. ","Out of the heart
 you see
 come evil plots
 murder
 adultery
 fornication
 theft
 false witness
 and blasphemy. ","These are the things that make someone unclean. But eating with unwashed hands doesn\u2019t make a person unclean.\u2019","\u2018I was only sent\u2019
 replied Jesus
 \u2018to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\u2019","\u2018It isn\u2019t right\u2019
 replied Jesus
 \u2018to take the children\u2019s bread and throw it to the dogs.\u2019","\u2018You\u2019ve got great faith
 haven\u2019t you
 my friend!\u2019 replied Jesus. \u2018All right; let it be as you wish.\u2019 And her daughter was healed from that moment.","Jesus called his disciples
 and said
 \u2018I am really sorry for the crowd. They\u2019ve been around me now for three days and they haven\u2019t got anything to eat. I don\u2019t want to send them away hungry; they might faint on the way home.\u2019","\u2018How many loaves have you got?\u2019 asked Jesus. \u2018Seven
\u2019 they replied
 \u2018and a few fish.\u2019","This was his reply to them: \u2018When it\u2019s evening you say
 \u201cSky looks like wine

 \u201cRed in the sky

 so why can\u2019t you work out the signs of the times? ","The generation that wants a sign is wicked and corrupt! No sign will be given to it
 except the sign of Jonah.\u2019 With that
 he left them and went away.","\u2018Watch out
\u2019 said Jesus to them
 \u2018and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\u2019","But Jesus knew what they were thinking. \u2018You really are a little-faith lot!\u2019 he said. \u2018Why are you discussing with each other that you haven\u2019t got any bread?","Don\u2019t you understand
 even now? Don\u2019t you remember the five loaves and the five thousand

 and how many baskets you picked up? ","Why can\u2019t you see that I wasn\u2019t talking about bread? Watch out for the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees!\u2019","Jesus came to Caesarea Philippi.

\u2019 he said
 \u2018and don\u2019t be afraid.\u2019","As they were coming down the mountain

 ever
 get into the kingdom of heaven. ","So if any of you make yourselves humble like this child
 you will be great in the kingdom of heaven. ","And if anyone welcomes one such child in my name
 they welcome me.\u2019","\u2018Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to trip up

 but it will be terrible for the person who makes them come.\u2019","\u2018But if your hand or your foot causes you to trip up
\u2019 Jesus continued
 \u2018cut it off and throw it away. It\u2019s better to enter into life crippled or lame than to go into eternal fire with both hands and both feet! ","And if your eye causes you to trip up
 pull it out and throw it away. Going into life with one eye is better than going into hell with two!","\u2018Take care not to despise one of these little ones. I tell you this: in heaven
 their angels are always gazing on the face of my father who lives there.","\u2018How does it seem to you? If someone has a hundred sheep and one of them wanders off and goes missing

 won\u2019t he? ","And when
 eventually
 he finds it
 I\u2019ll tell you the truth: he will celebrate over that one more than over the ninety-nine who didn\u2019t go missing! ","It\u2019s the same with your father in heaven. The last thing he wants is for a single one of these little ones to be lost.\u2019","\u2018If another disciple sins against you

 let me tell you the truth: if two of you come to an agreement on earth about any matter that you want to ask
 it will be done for you by my father in heaven. ","Yes: where two or three come together in my name
 I\u2019ll be there in the midst of them.\u2019","\u2018I wouldn\u2019t say seven times
\u2019 replied Jesus. \u2018Why not\u00a0\u2013 seventy times seven?\u2019","\u2018So
 you see
\u2019 he went on
 \u2018the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle up accounts with his servants. ","As he was beginning to sort it all out
 one man was brought before him who owed ten thousand talents. ","He had no means of paying it back
 so the master ordered him to be sold
 with his wife and children and everything he possessed
 and payment to be made.","\u2018So the servant fell down and prostrated himself before the master. \u2018\u202f\u201cBe patient with me
\u201d he said
 \u201cand I\u2019ll pay you everything!\u201d","\u2018The master was very sorry for the servant
 and let him off. He forgave him the loan.","\u2018But that servant went out and found one of his fellow-servants
 who owed him a hundred dinars. He seized him and began to throttle him. \u201cPay me back what you owe me!\u201d he said.","\u2018The colleague fell down and begged him
 \u201cBe patient with me
 and I\u2019ll pay you!\u201d","\u2018But he refused
 and went and threw him into prison until he could pay the debt.","\u2018So when his fellow-servants saw what had happened
 they were very upset. They went and informed their master about the whole affair. ","Then his master summoned him. \u2018\u202f\u201cYou\u2019re a scoundrel of a servant!\u201d he said to him. \u201cI let you off the whole debt
 because you begged me to.","Shouldn\u2019t you have taken pity on your colleague
 like I took pity on you?\u201d","\u2018His master was angry
 and handed him over to the torturers
 until he had paid the whole debt. ","And that\u2019s what my heavenly father will do to you
 unless each of you forgives your brother or sister from your heart.\u2019","\u2018Haven\u2019t you read\u2019
 he replied
 \u2018that the creator from the beginning \u201cmade them male and female\u201d? ","And this is what he said: \u201cFor this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife
 and the two shall become one flesh.\u201d ","As a result
 they are no longer two
 but one flesh. So humans shouldn\u2019t split up what God has joined together.\u2019","\u2018Moses gave you this instruction about how to divorce your wives
\u2019 replied Jesus
 \u2018because your hearts were hard. But that\u2019s not how it was at the beginning. ","Let me tell you this: anyone who divorces his wife
 except for immorality
 and marries another woman
 commits adultery.\u2019","\u2018Not everyone can accept this word
\u2019 replied Jesus; \u2018only the people it\u2019s given to. ","You see
 there are some eunuchs who are that way from birth. There are some who have been made eunuchs by others. And there are some who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. If anyone can receive this
 let them do so.\u2019","But Jesus said
 \u2018Let the children come to me! Don\u2019t stop them! They are the sort the kingdom of heaven belongs to!\u2019 ","\u2018Why come to me with questions about what\u2019s good?\u2019 retorted Jesus. \u2018There is One who is good! If you want to enter into life
 keep the commandments.\u2019","\u2018Which ones?\u2019 he asked. \u2018These ones
\u2019 Jesus answered: \u2018\u202f\u201cdon\u2019t murder
 don\u2019t commit adultery
 don\u2019t steal
 don\u2019t tell lies under oath
 ","respect your father and mother\u201d
 and \u201clove your neighbour as yourself\u201d.\u2019","\u2018If you want to complete the set
\u2019 Jesus replied
 \u2018go and sell everything you own and give it to the poor. That way you\u2019ll have treasure in heaven! Then come and follow me.\u2019","Jesus said to his disciples
 \u2018I\u2019m telling you the truth: it\u2019s very hard for a rich person to get into the kingdom of heaven. ","Let me say it again: it\u2019s easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter God\u2019s kingdom.\u2019","Jesus looked round at them. \u2018Humanly speaking
\u2019 he replied
 \u2018it\u2019s impossible. But everything\u2019s possible with God.\u2019","\u2018I\u2019m telling you the truth
\u2019 Jesus replied. \u2018In God\u2019s great new world
 when the son of man sits on his glorious throne
 those of you who have followed me will sit on twelve thrones\u00a0\u2013 yes
 you!\u00a0\u2013 and rule over the twelve tribes of Israel. ","And anyone who\u2019s left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or estates because of my name will get back a hundred times over
 and will inherit the life of that new age. ","But many at the front will find themselves at the back
 and the back ones at the front.\u2019","\u2018So you see
\u2019 Jesus continued
 \u2018the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard. ","He agreed with the workers to give them a dinar a day
 and sent them off to his vineyard.","\u2018He went out again in the middle of the morning
 and saw some others standing in the market-place with nothing to do.","\u2018\u202f\u201cYou too can go to the vineyard
\u201d he said
 \u201cand I\u2019ll give you what\u2019s right.\u201d ","So off they went. \u2018He went out again about midday
 and then in the middle of the afternoon
 and did the same.","Then
 with only an hour of the day left
 he went out and found other people standing there. \u2018\u202f\u201cWhy are you standing here all day with nothing to do?\u201d he asked them.","\u2018\u202f\u201cBecause no one has hired us
\u201d they replied. \u2018\u202f\u201cWell
\u201d he said
 \u201cyou too can go into the vineyard.\u201d","\u2018When evening came
 the vineyard-owner said to his servant
 \u201cCall the workers and give them their pay. Start with the last
 and go on to the first.\u201d","\u2018So the ones who had worked for one hour came
 and each of them received a dinar. ","When the first ones came
 they thought they would get something more; but they
 too
 each received a dinar.","\u2018When they had been given it
 they grumbled against the landowner. ","\u201cThis lot who came in last\u201d
 they said
 \u201chave only worked for one hour\u00a0\u2013 and they\u2019ve been put on a level with us! And we did all the hard work
 all day
 and in the heat as well!\u201d","\u2018\u202f\u201cMy friend
\u201d he said to one of them
 \u201cI\u2019m not doing you any wrong. You agreed with me on one dinar
 didn\u2019t you? ","Take it! It\u2019s yours! And be on your way. I want to give this fellow who came at the end the same as you.","Or are you suggesting that I\u2019m not allowed to do what I like with my own money? Or are you giving me the evil eye because I\u2019m good?\u201d","\u2018So those at the back will be at the front
 and the front ones at the back.\u2019","\u2018Look here. We\u2019re going up to Jerusalem. The son of man will be handed over to the chief priests and the scribes
 and they\u2019re going to condemn him to death. ","They will hand him over to the pagans
 and they\u2019re going to mock him
 flog him and crucify him. And on the third day he will be raised.\u2019","\u2018What d\u2019you want?\u2019 he asked her. \u2018It\u2019s about these two sons of mine
\u2019 she said to him. \u2018Please say that
 when you\u2019re king
 they may sit
 one at your right hand and one at your left.\u2019","\u2018You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re asking for
\u2019 said Jesus. \u2018Can you two drink the cup I\u2019m going to drink?\u2019 \u2018Yes
 we can
\u2019 they replied.","But Jesus called them together. \u2018You know how it is with pagan rulers
\u2019 he said. \u2018They lord it over their subjects. They get all high and mighty and let everybody know it. ","But that\u2019s not how it\u2019s to be with you. If any of you wants to be great
 he must be your servant. ","If any of you wants to be first
 he must be the slave of all. ","That\u2019s how it is with the son of man: he didn\u2019t come to have servants obey him
 but to be a servant\u00a0\u2013 and to give his life as \u201ca ransom for many\u201d.\u2019","Jesus came to a stop. He called them.","\u2018Go into the village over there
\u2019 he said
 \u2018and at once you\u2019ll find a donkey tied up
 and a foal beside it. Untie them and bring them to me. ","And if anyone says anything to you
 say
 \u201cThe master needs them
 and he\u2019ll send them back straight away.\u201d\u202f\u2019 He sent them off at once.","\u2018This is what the Bible says
\u2019 he said to them
 My house will be called a house of prayer \u2013 but you have made it a brigands\u2019 lair!\u2019","\u2018Do you hear what they\u2019re saying?\u2019 they asked Jesus. \u2018Yes
\u2019 said Jesus. \u2018Did you never read what it says
 You called forth praise to rise to you from newborn babes and infants too!\u2019","He saw a single fig tree beside the road
 but when he came up to it he found nothing on it except leaves. \u2018May you never bear fruit
 ever again!\u2019 he said to it. Instantly the fig tree withered up.","\u2018I\u2019m telling you the truth
\u2019 replied Jesus. \u2018If you have faith
 and don\u2019t doubt
 you will not only be able to do this to a fig tree
 but if you say to this mountain
 \u201cBe lifted up and thrown into the sea\u201d
 it will happen. ","Whatever you ask in prayer
 you\u2019ll get it
 if you believe.\u2019","\u2018I\u2019m going to ask you one question
 too
\u2019 replied Jesus
 \u2018and if you tell me the answer then I\u2019ll tell you by what right I\u2019m doing these things. ","Where did John\u2019s baptism come from? Was it from heaven
 or from this world?\u2019 They debated this among themselves. \u2018If we say \u201cfrom heaven\u201d
\u2019 they said
 \u2018he\u2019s going to say to us
 \u201cSo why didn\u2019t you believe him?\u201d ","So they answered Jesus
 \u2018We don\u2019t know.\u2019 \u2018Well
 then

 \u2018nor will I tell you by what right I\u2019m doing these things.\u2019","\u2018What d\u2019you think?\u2019 he went on. \u2018Once upon a time there was a man who had two sons. \u2018He went to the first one and said
 \u201cNow then
 my boy
 off you go and do a day\u2019s work in the vineyard.\u201d","\u2018\u202f\u201cDon\u2019t want to
\u201d replied the son; but afterwards he thought better of it and went.","\u2018He went to the other son and said the same thing. \u2018\u202f\u201cCertainly
 Master
\u201d he said; but he didn\u2019t go.","\u2018So which of the two did what his father wanted?\u2019 \u2018The first
\u2019 they answered. \u2018I\u2019m telling you the truth
\u2019 Jesus said to them. \u2018The tax-collectors and prostitutes are going into God\u2019s kingdom ahead of you! ","Yes: John came to you
 in accordance with God\u2019s righteous covenant plan
 and you didn\u2019t believe him\u00a0\u2013 but the tax-collectors and prostitutes believed him. But when you saw it
 you didn\u2019t think better of it afterwards and believe him.\u2019","\u2018Listen to another parable
\u2019 Jesus went on. \u2018Once upon a time there was a householder who planted a vineyard
 built a wall for it
 dug out a wine-press in it
 and built a tower. Then he let it out to tenant farmers and went away on a journey.","\u2018When harvest time arrived
 he sent his slaves to the farmers to collect his produce. ","The farmers seized his slaves; they beat one
 killed another
 and stoned another. ","Again he sent other slaves
 more than before
 and they treated them in the same way. ","Finally he sent his son to them. \u2018\u202f\u201cThey\u2019ll respect my son
\u201d he said.","\u2018But the farmers saw the son. \u2018\u202f\u201cThis fellow\u2019s the heir!\u201d they said among themselves. \u201cCome on
 let\u2019s kill him
 and then we can take over the property!\u201d","\u2018So they seized him
 threw him out of the vineyard
 and killed him.","\u2018Now then: when the vineyard-owner returns
 what will he do to those farmers?\u2019","\u2018He\u2019ll kill them brutally
 the wretches!\u2019 they said. \u2018And he\u2019ll lease the vineyard to other farmers who\u2019ll give him the produce at the right time.\u2019","\u2018Did you never read what the Bible says?\u2019 said Jesus to them: The stone the builders threw away is now atop the corner; it\u2019s from the Lord
 all this
 they say and we looked on in wonder.","\u2018So then let me tell you this: God\u2019s kingdom is going to be taken away from you and given to a nation that will produce the goods.","Anyone who falls on this stone will be smashed to pieces
 and anyone it falls on will be crushed.\u2019","\u2018The kingdom of heaven\u2019
 he said
 \u2018is like a king who made a wedding feast for his son. ","He sent his slaves to call the invited guests to the wedding
 and they didn\u2019t want to come.","\u2018Again he sent other slaves
 with these instructions: \u201cSay to the guests
 Look! I\u2019ve got my dinner ready; my bulls and fatted calves have been killed; everything is prepared. Come to the wedding!\u201d","\u2018But they didn\u2019t take any notice. They went off
 one to his own farm
 another to see to his business. ","The others laid hands on his slaves
 abused them and killed them. ","(The king was angry
 and sent his soldiers to destroy those murderers and burn down their city.) ","Then he said to his slaves
 \u201cThe wedding is ready
 but the guests didn\u2019t deserve it. ","So go to the roads leading out of town
 and invite everyone you find to the wedding.\u201d ","The slaves went off into the streets and rounded up everyone they found
 bad and good alike. And the wedding was filled with partygoers.","\u2018But when the king came in to look at the guests
 he saw there a man who wasn\u2019t wearing a wedding suit.","\u2018\u202f\u201cMy friend
\u201d he said to him
 \u201chow did you get in here without a wedding suit?\u201d And he was speechless. ","Then the king said to the servants
 \u201cTie him up
 hands and feet
 and throw him into the darkness outside
 where people weep and grind their teeth.\u201d","\u2018Many are called

 \u2018because you don\u2019t know your Bibles or God\u2019s power. ","In the resurrection
 you see
 people don\u2019t marry or get married off; they are like angels in heaven. ","But as for the resurrection of the dead

 and with all your mind. ","This is the first commandment
 and it\u2019s the one that really matters. ","The second is similar
 and it\u2019s this: You must love your neighbour as yourself. ","The entire law hangs on these two commandments\u00a0\u2013 and that goes for the prophets
 too.\u2019","\u2018What\u2019s your view of the Messiah? Whose son is he?\u2019","\u2018Why then\u2019

","The Master says to my master

 to be seen by people. Yes

 in heaven. ","Nor should you be called \u201cteacher\u201d

 you stop them.","\u2018Woe betide you
 scribes and Pharisees
 you hypocrites! You cross sea and land to make one single Gentile take up Judaism

 \u201cLook! Here is the Messiah!\u201d or \u201cLook! There he is!\u201d
 don\u2019t believe them. ","False messiahs will arise
 you see
 and false prophets too. They will provide great signs and portents
 so as to deceive even God\u2019s chosen ones
 if that were possible. ","Remember
 I\u2019m telling you this beforehand!","\u2018So if someone says to you
 \u201cLook! He\u2019s out in the wilderness\u201d
 don\u2019t go out. If they say
 \u201cLook
 he\u2019s in the inner room\u201d
 don\u2019t believe them. ","You see
 the royal appearing of the son of man will be like the lightning that comes from the East and flashes across to the West. ","Where the carcass is
 there the vultures will gather.\u2019","\u2018Straight away
\u2019 Jesus continued
 \u2018after the suffering that those days will bring
 The sun will turn to darkness
 and the moon won\u2019t give its light; the stars will fall from heaven
 and the powers of heaven will shake.","\u2018And then the sign of the son of man will appear in heaven; then all the tribes of the earth will mourn. They will see \u201cthe son of man coming on the clouds of heaven\u201d with power and great glory.","He will send off his messengers with a great trumpet-blast
 and they will collect his chosen ones from the four winds
 from one end of heaven to the other.","\u2018Learn the hidden meaning from the fig tree. When its branch begins to sprout
 and to push out its leaves
 then you know that summer is nearly there. ","So with you: when you see all these things
 you will know that it is near
 at the very gates. ","I\u2019m telling you the truth: this generation won\u2019t be gone before all these things happen.","Heaven and earth will disappear
 but my words will never
 ever disappear.\u2019","\u2018Nobody knows what day or time this will happen
\u2019 Jesus went on. \u2018The angels in heaven don\u2019t know it
 and nor does the son; only the father knows. ","You see
 the royal appearing of the son of man will be like the days of Noah.","\u2018What does that mean? Well
 in those days
 before the flood
 they were eating and drinking
 they were getting married and giving children in marriage
 right up to the day when Noah went into the ark. ","They didn\u2019t know about it until the flood came and swept them all away. That\u2019s what it\u2019ll be like at the royal appearing of the son of man.","\u2018On that day there will be two people working in the field. One will be taken
 the other will be left. ","There will be two women grinding corn in the mill. One will be taken
 the other will be left.","\u2018So keep alert! You don\u2019t know what day your master will come.","But bear this in mind: if the householder had known what time of night the burglar was going to come
 he would have stayed awake and wouldn\u2019t have let his house get broken into. ","So you too must be ready! The son of man is coming at a time you don\u2019t expect.\u2019","\u2018So
\u2019 Jesus went on
 \u2018who then is the trustworthy and sensible slave
 the one the master will set over his household
 so that he will give them their meals at the right time? ","Blessings on the servant whom the master
 when he comes
 finds doing just that. ","I\u2019m telling you the truth: he\u2019ll promote him to be over all his belongings.","But if the wicked slave says in his heart
 \u201cMy master\u2019s taking his time\u201d
 ","and starts to beat the other slaves
 and to feast and drink with the drunkards
 ","the master of that slave will come on a day he doesn\u2019t expect
 and at a time he doesn\u2019t know. ","He will cut him in two
 and put him along with the hypocrites
 where people will weep and grind their teeth.\u2019","\u2018Then
\u2019 continued Jesus
 \u2018the kingdom of heaven will be like ten girls who each took their own torches and went out to meet the bridegroom. ","Five of them were silly
 and five were sensible. ","The silly ones took their torches
 but didn\u2019t take oil with them. ","The sensible ones took oil
 in flasks
 along with their torches.","\u2018The bridegroom took his time coming
 and they all nodded off and went to sleep. ","In the middle of the night a shout went up: \u201cHere\u2019s the bridegroom! Come on and meet him!\u201d","Then all the girls got up and trimmed the wicks of their torches.","\u2018The silly ones said to the sensible ones
 \u201cGive us some of your oil! Our torches are going out!\u201d","\u2018But the sensible ones answered
 \u201cNo! If we do that
 there won\u2019t be enough for all of us together! You\u2019d better go to the dealers and buy some for yourselves.\u201d","\u2018So off they went to buy oil. But
 while they were gone
 the bridegroom arrived. The ones who were ready went in with him to the wedding party
 and the door was shut.","\u2018Later on the other girls came back. \u201cMaster
 Master!\u201d they said
 \u201copen the door for us!\u201d","\u2018\u202f\u201cI\u2019m telling you the truth
\u201d he said
 \u201cI don\u2019t know you.\u201d","\u2018So keep awake! You don\u2019t know the day or the hour.\u2019","\u2018This is what it will be like
\u2019 Jesus went on. \u2018It will be like a man who was going off on a journey. He summoned his slaves
 and handed over control of his property to them. ","He gave five talents to the first
 two to the next
 and one to the last\u00a0\u2013 each according to his ability. Then he left. 'Straight away","the man who had been given the five talents went out and traded with them
 and made five more. ","Similarly
 the one who had received two talents went and made another two. ","But the one who received a single talent went and dug a hole in the ground
 and hid his master\u2019s money.","\u2018After a long time
 the master of those slaves came back and settled accounts with them. ","The man who had received five talents came forward and gave him the other five talents. \u201cMaster
\u201d he said
 \u201cyou gave me five talents. Look: I\u2019ve made another five!\u201d ","\u201cWell done indeed
\u201d said his master. \u201cYou\u2019re an excellent slave
 and loyal too! You\u2019ve been trustworthy with small things
 and now I\u2019m going to put you in charge of bigger ones. Come and join your master\u2019s celebration!\u201d","\u2018Then the man who had had the two talents came forward. \u201cMaster
\u201d he said
 \u201cyou gave me two talents. Look: I\u2019ve made another two!\u201d ","\u201cWell done indeed
\u201d said his master. \u201cYou\u2019re an excellent slave
 and loyal too! You\u2019ve been trustworthy with small things
 and now I\u2019m going to put you in charge of bigger ones. Come and join your master\u2019s celebration!\u201d","\u2018Then the man who had had the one talent came forward. \u201cMaster
\u201d he said
 \u201cI knew that you were a hard man. You reap where you didn\u2019t sow
 and you profit from things you never invested in. ","So I was scared! I went and hid your talent in the ground. Here it is: it\u2019s yours
 you can have it back.\u201d","\u2018\u202f\u201cYou\u2019re a wicked and lazy slave!\u201d answered his master. \u201cSo! You knew that I reap where I didn\u2019t sow
 and profit from investments I never made? ","Then you should have put my money with the bankers
 and when I returned I would have received back what I had with interest!","\u2018\u202f\u201cSo take the talent from him
\u201d he went on
 \u201cand give it to the man who has ten talents.\u201d ","(If someone already has something
 you see
 they will be given more
 and they\u2019ll have plenty. But if someone has nothing
 even what they have will be taken away from them.) ","\u201cBut as for this useless slave
 throw him outside in the dark
 where people weep and grind their teeth.\u201d\u202f\u2019","\u2018When the son of man comes in his glory
\u2019 Jesus went on
 \u2018and all the angels with him
 then he will sit on his glorious throne. ","All the nations will be assembled in front of him
 and he will separate them from one another
 like a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. ","He will stand the sheep at his right hand
 and the goats at his left.","\u2018Then the king will say to those on his right
 \u201cCome here
 you people who my father has blessed. Inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world! ","Why? Because I was hungry and you gave me something to eat. I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink. I was a stranger and you made me welcome.","I was naked and you clothed me; I was sick and you looked after me; I was in prison and you came to me.\u201d","\u2018Then the righteous will answer him

 or thirsty and give you a drink? ","When did we see you a stranger and welcome you
 or naked and clothe you? ","When did we see you sick or in prison and come to see you?\u201d","\u2018Then the king will answer them
 \u201cI\u2019m telling you the truth: when you did it to one of the least significant of my brothers and sisters here

 \u201cGet away from me! You\u2019re accursed! Go to the everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels! ","Why? Because I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat! I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink!","I was a stranger and you didn\u2019t welcome me; I was naked and you didn\u2019t clothe me; I was sick and in prison and you didn\u2019t look after me!\u201d","\u2018Then they too will answer

 she did it to prepare me for my burial. ","I\u2019m telling you the truth: wherever this gospel is announced in all the world

 he said
 \u2018I\u2019m telling you the truth: one of you will betray me.\u2019 ","\u2018It\u2019s one who\u2019s dipped his hand with me in the dish

 as the Bible said it would happen
 but it\u2019s misery for the man who hands him over. It would be better for that man if he\u2019d never been born.\u2019","At this
 Judas
 who was planning to betray him
 said
 \u2018It isn\u2019t me
 is it
 Teacher?\u2019 \u2018You\u2019ve just said so
\u2019 he replied.","As they were eating
 Jesus took some bread
 blessed it
 broke it and gave it to the disciples. \u2018Take it and eat it

 \u2018this is my body.\u2019","Then he took a cup; and
 after giving thanks
 he gave it to them. \u2018Drink this

 which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. ","But let me tell you this: I will not drink any more from this fruit of the vine
 until that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of my father.\u2019","Then Jesus said to them
 \u2018You are all going to stumble and fall tonight because of me. This is what the Bible says
 you see: I shall strike the shepherd
 and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.","\u2018But after I am raised up
 I shall go on ahead of you to Galilee.\u2019","\u2018I\u2019m telling you the truth

 \u2018this very night
 before the cock has crowed
 you will deny me three times.\u2019","So Jesus went with them to the place called Gethsemane. \u2018You sit here
\u2019 he said to the disciples
 \u2018while I go over there and pray.\u2019","\u2018My soul is overwhelmed with grief
\u2019 he said
 \u2018even to death. Stay here and keep watch with me.\u2019","Then
 going a little further on
 he fell on his face and prayed. \u2018My father

 \u2018if it\u2019s possible \u2013 please
 please let this cup go away from me! But . . . not what I want
 but what you want.\u2019","He came back to the disciples and found them asleep. \u2018So
\u2019 he said to Peter
 \u2018couldn\u2019t you keep watch with me for a single hour? ","Watch and pray so that you don\u2019t get pulled down into the time of testing. The spirit is eager
 but the body is weak.\u2019","Again
 for the second time
 he went off and said
 \u2018My father
 if it\u2019s not possible for this to pass unless I drink it
 let your will be done.\u2019","Then he came back to the disciples. \u2018You can sleep now

 \u2018what have you come to do?\u2019 Then they came and laid hands on Jesus
 and arrested him.","\u2018Put your sword back where it belongs!\u2019 said Jesus to him. \u2018People who use the sword die by the sword!","Don\u2019t you realize that I could call on my father and have him send me more than twelve legions of angels
 just like that? ","But how then can the Bible come true when it says this has to happen?\u2019","At that time Jesus said to the crowds
 \u2018Have you really come out with swords and sticks to arrest me
 as if I were some kind of brigand? I sat there teaching in the Temple every day
 and you didn\u2019t arrest me! ","But all this has happened so that the writings of the prophets would be fulfilled.\u2019 Then all the disciples abandoned him and ran away.","\u2018You said the words
\u2019 replied Jesus. \u2018But let me tell you this: from now on you will see \u201cthe son of man sitting at the right hand of the Power
 and coming on the clouds of heaven\u201d.\u2019","And Peter remembered. He remembered the words Jesus had spoken to him: \u2018Before the cock crows
 you will deny me three times.\u2019 And he went outside and cried like a baby.","So Jesus stood in front of the governor. \u2018Are you the King of the Jews?\u2019 the governor asked him. \u2018If you say so

 there was Jesus himself. He met them and said

 answering
 said to him

 he permitted Him.","But He
 answering
 said

 and despise the other. You cannot serve God and riches.","\u201cTherefore I say to you
 do not be careful for your life
 what you shall eat
 or what you shall drink; nor for your body
 what you shall put on. Is not the life more worth than food? And the body than clothing?","\u201cBehold the birds of the heaven. For they neither sow nor reap
 nor carry into the barns. Yet your Heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much better than they?","\u201cWhich of you by worrying is able to add one cubit to his stature?","\u201cAnd why do you care for clothes? Learn how the lilies of the field grow. They neither weary nor spin.","\u201cYet I say to you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.","\u201cSo
 if God so clothes the grass of the field
 which is here today and tomorrow is cast into the oven
 shall He not do much more to you? O you of little faith.","\u201cTherefore
 take no thought saying
 \u2018What shall we eat?\u2019 or \u2018What shall we drink?\u2019 or \u2018How shall we be clothed?\u2019","\u201cFor the Gentiles seek after all these things. And your Heavenly Father knows that you have need of all these things.","\u201cBut seek first the Kingdom of God
 and His righteousness
 and all these things shall be added to you.","\u201cCare not then for tomorrow. For tomorrow shall care for itself. The day has enough with its own grief.\u201d","\u201cJudge not
 that you be not judged.","\u201cFor with what judgment you judge
 you shall be judged. And with what measure you measure
 it shall be measured to you again.","\u201cAnd why do you see the splinter that is in your brother\u2019s eye
 and not perceive the beam that is in your own eye?","\u201cOr how can you say to your brother
 \u2018Let me cast out the splinter from your eye\u2019
 and behold a beam is in your own eye?","\u201cHypocrite! First
 cast out that beam from own eye
 and then you shall see clearly to cast out the splinter from your brother\u2019s eye.","\u201cDo not give that which is holy to dogs
 nor cast your pearls before swine
 lest they tread them under their feet. And
 turning again
 all attack you!","\u201cAsk
 and it shall be given you. Seek
 and you shall find. Knock
 and it shall be opened to you.","\u201cFor whoever asks
 receives. And he that seeks
 finds. And to him that knocks
 it shall be opened.","\u201cFor what man is there among you who
 if his son asks him for bread
 would give him a stone?","\u201cOr if he asks for a fish
 will give him a serpent?","\u201cIf you then
 who are evil
 can give to your children good gifts
 how much more shall your Father
 Who is in Heaven
 give good things to those who ask Him?","\u201cTherefore
 whatever you would have men do to you
 even so do to them. For this is the Law and the Prophets.","\u201cEnter in at the strait gate. For it is the wide gate and broad way that leads to destruction. And many go in there.","\u201cBecause the gate is strait and the way narrow that leads to life
 and there are few who find it.","\u201cBeware of false prophets who come to you in sheep\u2019s clothing; but inwardly
 they are ravening wolves.","\u201cYou shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes from thorns
 or figs from thistles?","\u201cSo every good tree brings forth good fruit
 and a corrupt tree brings forth evil fruit.","\u201cA good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit
 nor can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.","\u201cEvery tree that does not bring forth good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire.","\u201cTherefore
 you shall know them by their fruits.","\u201cNot everyone that says to Me
 \u2018Lord
 Lord\u2019
 shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven
 but he who does My Father\u2019s will
 Who is in Heaven.","\u201cMany will say to Me on that Day
 \u2018Lord
 Lord
 have we not prophesied in Your Name; and by Your Name cast out devils; and by Your Name done many great works?\u2019","\u201cAnd then will I proclaim to them
 \u2018I never knew you. Depart from Me
 you who work iniquity.\u2019","\u201cWhoever then hears these words
 and does the same
 will be like a wise man who has built his house on a rock.","\u201cAnd the rain fell
 and the floods came
 and the winds blew
 and beat upon that house. And it did not fall. For it was grounded on a rock.","\u201cBut whoever hears these
 My words
 and does not do them
 shall be like a foolish man
 who has built his house upon the sand.","\u201cAnd the rain fell
 and the floods came
 and the winds blew
 and beat upon that house. And it fell. And its fall was great.\u201d","And Jesus
 putting forth His hand
 touched him
 saying
 \u201cI will. Be clean.\u201d And immediately
 his leprosy was cleansed.","Then Jesus said to him
 \u201cSee that you tell no one. But go and show yourself to the priest. And offer the gift that Moses commanded
 for a witness to them.\u201d","And Jesus said to him
 \u201cI will come and heal him.\u201d","When Jesus heard that
 He marveled
 and said to those who followed Him
 \u201cTruly
 I say to you
 I have not found so great faith
 even in Israel.","\u201cBut
 I say to you that many shall come from the east and west and shall sit down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven.","\u201cAnd the children of the Kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\u201d","Then Jesus said to the centurion
 \u201cGo your way. And as you have believed
 so be it done to you.\u201d And his servant was healed that same hour.","But Jesus said to him
 \u201cThe foxes have holes
 and the birds of the heaven have nests

 \u201cFollow Me. And let the dead bury the dead.\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cWhy are you fearful? O you of little faith.\u201d Then He arose and rebuked the winds and the sea. And so
 there was a great calm.","And He said to them
 \u201cGo!\u201d So
 they went out and departed into the herd of swine. And behold
 the whole herd of swine ran headlong into the sea and died in the water.","And lo
 they brought to Him a paralytic
 laid on a bed. And Jesus
 seeing their faith
 said to the paralytic
 \u201cSon
 be of good courage. Your sins are forgiven you.\u201d","And Jesus
 knowing their thoughts
 said
 \u201cWhy do you think evil things in your hearts?","\u201cFor
 which is easier to say
 \u2018Your sins are forgiven you\u2019 or \u2018Arise
 and walk\u2019?","\u201cBut
 so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins (then He said to the paralytic) Arise! Take up your bed
 and go to your house!\u201d","And as Jesus went forth from there
 He saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector\u2019s booth
 and said to him
 \u201cFollow Me.\u201d And he arose and followed Him.","Now when Jesus heard it
 He said to them
 \u201cThe healthy do not need the Physician
 but those who are sick.","\u201cBut go and learn what this means
 \u2018I will have mercy
 and not sacrifice.\u2019 For I have not come to call the righteous
 but the sinners
 to repentance.\u201d","And Jesus said to them
 \u201cCan the children of the marriage chamber lament as long as the Bridegroom is with them? But the days will come
 when the Bridegroom shall be taken from them. And then they shall fast.","\u201cMoreover
 no one patches an old garment with a piece of unshrunk cloth. For that which patches it pulls away from the garment
 and the breach is worsened.","\u201cNor do they put new wine into old vessels. For then the vessels would break
 and the wine would be spilled. And the vessels would perish. But they put new wine into new vessels. And so
 both are preserved.\u201d","Then Jesus turned around. And seeing her
 He said
 \u201cDaughter
 be encouraged. Your faith has made you whole. And the woman was made whole at that same moment.","He said to them
 \u201cLeave. For the maid is not dead
 but sleeps.\u201d And they laughed Him to scorn.","And when He had come into the house
 the blind came to Him. And Jesus said to them

 the harvest is great. But the laborers are few.","\u201cTherefore
 pray that the Lord of the Harvest would send out laborers into His harvest.\u201d","Jesus sent forth these twelve and commanded them

 greet it.","\u201cAnd if the house is worthy

 it shall be easier for those of the land of Sodom and Gomorrah on the Day of Judgment
 than for that city.","\u201cBehold
 I send you as sheep in the midst of the wolves. Therefore
 be wise as serpents and innocent as doves.","\u201cBut beware of men. For they will deliver you up to the councils and will scourge you in their synagogues.","\u201cAnd you shall be brought to the governors and kings for My sake
 in witness to them and to the Gentiles.","\u201cBut when they deliver you up
 take no thought how or what you shall speak. For what you shall say will be given to you at that hour.","\u201cFor it is not you who speak. But the Spirit of your Father speaks in you.","\u201cAnd the brother shall betray the brother to death
 and the father the son. And the children shall rise against their parents and shall cause them to die.","\u201cAnd you shall be hated by all for My Name. But the one who endures to the end
 he shall be saved.","\u201cAnd when they persecute you in this city
 flee into another. For truly I say to you
 you shall not have completed all the cities of Israel until the Son of Man comes.","\u201cThe disciple is not above his master
 nor the servant above his Lord.","\u201cIt is enough for the disciple to be as his master is
 and the servant as his Lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub
 how much more those of his household?","\u201cTherefore do not fear them. For there is nothing covered that shall not be disclosed
 nor hid
 that shall not be known.","\u201cWhat I tell you in darkness
 speak in light. And what you hear in the ear
 preach on the housetops.","\u201cAnd do not fear them who kill the body but are not able to kill the soul. But rather fear Him Who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.","\u201cAre not two sparrows sold for a pittance
 and yet not one of them shall fall to the ground apart from your Father?","\u201cIndeed. And all the hairs of your head are numbered.","\u201cTherefore
 do not fear. You are of more value than many sparrows.","\u201cWhoever
 then
 shall confess Me before men
 I will also confess him before My Father Who is in Heaven.","\u201cBut whoever shall deny Me before men
 I will also deny him before My Father Who is in Heaven.","\u201cDo not think that I came to send peace to the earth. I did not come to send peace
 but the sword.","\u201cFor I have come to set a man at variance against his father

 he shall not lose his reward.\u201d","And Jesus
 answering
 said to them
 \u201cGo
 and show John what things you hear and see.","\u201cThe blind receive sight. And the lame walk. The lepers are cleansed. And the deaf hear. The dead are raised up. And the poor receive the Gospel.","\u201cAnd blessed is he who shall not be offended by Me.\u201d","And as they departed

 \u2018He has a demon.\u2019","\u201cThe Son of Man came eating and drinking

 O Father
 because it was pleasing before You.","\u201cAll things are given to Me by My Father: and no one knows the Son
 but the Father. Nor does anyone know the Father

 and My burden light.\u201d","But He said to them
 \u201cHave you not read what David did when he and those who were with him were hungry?","\u201cHow he went into the house of God
 and ate the showbread (which was not lawful for him to eat

 but only for the priests)?","\u201cOr have you not read in the Law how that
 on the Sabbath days
 the priests in the Temple break the Sabbath and are blameless?","\u201cBut I say to you that here is One greater than the Temple.","\u201cTherefore
 if you knew what this meant
 \u2018I will have mercy and not sacrifice\u2019

 does not take it and lift it out?","\u201cHow much better
 then
 is a man than a sheep? Therefore
 it is lawful to do well on a Sabbath day.\u201d","\u201cThen He said to the man
 \u201cStretch forth your hand.\u201d And he stretched it forth. And it was made whole as the other.","But Jesus knew their thoughts

 \u201cEvery kingdom divided against itself is brought to naught. And every city or house divided against itself shall not stand.","\u201cSo
 if Satan casts out Satan
 he is divided against himself. How then shall his kingdom endure?","\u201cAlso
 if I cast out demons through Beelzebub
 by whom do your sons cast them out? They shall therefore be your judges.","\u201cBut if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God

 the mouth speaks.","\u201cA good man brings forth good things out of the good treasure of his heart. And an evil man
 out of an evil treasure
 brings forth evil things.","\u201cBut I say to you
 that of every idle word that men shall speak
 they shall give account thereof on the Day of Judgment.","For by your words you shall be justified

 so shall the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.","\u201cThe men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation and condemn it. For they repented at the preaching of Jonah. And behold
 a Greater than Jonah is here.","\u201cThe Queen of the South shall rise in judgment with this generation and shall condemn it. For she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon. And behold
 a Greater than Solomon is here.","\u201cNow when the unclean spirit has gone out of a man
 it walks throughout dry places
 seeking rest
 and finds none.","\u201cThen it says
 \u2018I will return to my house
 from where I came.\u2019 And when he has come
 he finds it empty
 swept and garnished.","\u201cThen it goes
 and takes with it seven other spirits
 worse than itself. And they enter in
 and dwell there. And the end of that man is worse than the beginning. Even so shall it be with this wicked generation.\u201d","While he was still speaking to the multitude
 behold
 his mother
 and his brothers stood outside
 desiring to speak with him.","But He answered and said to him that told Him
 \u201cWho is My mother

 a sower went out to sow.","\u201cAnd as he sowed
 some fell by the wayside. And the birds came and devoured them.","\u201cAnd some fell upon stony ground
 where they did not have much earth. And soon they sprang up
 because they had no depth of earth.","\u201cBut when the sun came up
 they were burnt up; and for lack of rooting
 withered away.","\u201cAnd some fell among thorns. And the thorns sprang up and choked them.","But some fell in good ground
 and brought forth fruit; one corn a hundredfold
 some sixtyfold

 let him hear.\u201d","And He answered and said to them
 \u201cBecause it has been given to you to know the secrets of the Kingdom of Heaven. But to them it is not given.","\u201cFor whoever has
 to him shall be given. And he shall have abundance. But whoever does not have
 even that which he has shall be taken away from him.","\u201cTherefore
 I speak to them in parables. Because they
 seeing
 do not see. And hearing
 they do not hear
 nor understand.","\u201cSo in them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled which says
 \u2018By hearing you shall hear and shall not understand; and seeing
 you shall see and shall not perceive.","\u201c\u2018For this people\u2019s heart has grown fat and their ears barely hear and they have closed their eyes

 for they see; and your ears
 for they hear.","\u201cFor truly I say to you that many Prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which you see and have not seen them; and to hear those things which you hear and have not heard them.","\u201cTherefore
 hear the parable of the Sower.","\u201cWhenever anyone hears the word of the Kingdom
 and does not understand it
 the evil one comes and snatches away that which was sown in his heart. And this is the one who has received the seed by the wayside.","\u201cAnd the one who received seed in the stony ground
 is he who hears the word
 and immediately
 with joy
 receives it
","\u201cBut he has no root in himself and endures but a season. For as soon as trouble or persecution comes because of the word
 he quickly stumbles.","\u201cAnd the one who receives the seed among thorns
 is he who hears the word
 but the care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word. And it is made unfruitful.","\u201cBut the one who receives the seed in the good ground
 is he who hears the word and understands it
 who also bears fruit and brings forth; some a hundredfold
 some sixtyfold
 and some thirtyfold.\u201d","He put forth another parable to them
 saying
 \u201cThe Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.","\u201cBut while the men slept
 his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat
 and went his way.","\u201cAnd when the blade had sprung up and brought forth fruit
 the weeds also appeared.","\u201cThen the servants of the landowner came
 and said to him
 \u2018Master

 \u2018Some envious man has done this.\u2019 Then the servants said to him
 \u2018Do you wish us to go and gather them up?\u2019","\u201cBut he said
 \u2018No
 lest while you are gathering the weeds you also pluck up the wheat with them.","\u201c\u2018Let both grow together until the harvest. And at harvest time I will say to the reapers
 \u201cFirst
 gather the weeds
 and bind them in sheaves to burn them. But gather the wheat into my barn.\u201d\u2019\u201d","\u201cHe put forth another parable to them
 saying
 \u201cThe Kingdom of Heaven is like a grain of mustard seed
 which a man takes and sows in his field
","\u201cwhich indeed is the least of all seeds. But when it is grown
 it is the greatest among herbs. And it becomes a tree
 so that the birds of heaven come and build in its branches.\u201d","He spoke another parable to them
 \u201cThe Kingdom of Heaven is like leaven
 which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal
 till all was leavened.\u201d","Then He answered
 and said to them
 \u201cHe who sows the good seed is the Son of Man.","\u201cAnd the field is the world. And the good seed are the children of the Kingdom. And the weeds are the children of the evil one.","\u201cAnd the enemy who sows them is the devil. And the harvest is the end of the world. And the reapers are the angels.","\u201cJust as the weeds are gathered and burned in the fire
 so shall it be at the end of this world.","\u201cThe Son of Man shall send forth his angels. And they shall gather all stumbling blocks out of his Kingdom
 and those who do iniquity
","\u201cand shall cast them into a furnace of fire. There shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.","\u201cThen shall the just shine as the sun in the Kingdom of their Father. The one who has ears to hear
 let him hear.","\u201cAgain
 the Kingdom of Heaven is like a treasure
 hidden in the field. Which
 when a man has found
 he hides it. And for joy thereof
 departs and sells all that he has
 and buys that field.","\u201cAgain
 the Kingdom of Heaven is like a merchant man who seeks good pearls
","\u201cWho
 having found a pearl of great price
 went and sold all that he had and bought it.","\u201cAgain
 the Kingdom of Heaven is like a draw net
 cast into the sea
 which gathers of all kinds of things;","\u201cwhich
 when it is full
 they draw to land
 and sit and gather the good into vessels
 and cast away the bad.","\u201cSo shall it be at the end of the world. The angels shall go forth
 and separate the bad from among the just;","\u201cand shall cast them into a furnace of fire. There shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.\u201d","\u201cJesus said to them

 he walked on the water to go to Jesus.","So immediately
 Jesus stretched forth His hand
 and caught him
 and said to him
 \u201cO you of little faith. Why did you doubt?","But He answered and said to them
 \u201cAnd why do you transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?","\u201cFor God has commanded
 saying
 \u2018Honor your father and mother. And the one who curses father or mother
 let him die the death.\u2019","\u201cBut you say
 \u2018Whoever shall say to father or mother
 \u201cBy the gift that is offered by me
\u201d you may have profit;","though he does not honor his father or his mother. Thus
 by your tradition
 you have made the commandment of God of no authority.","\u201cO hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied well of you
 saying
","\u201c\u2018This people draws near to Me with their mouth
 and honors Me with the lips
 but their heart is far away from Me.","\u2018But they worship Me in vain
 teaching men\u2019s precepts as doctrines.\u2019\u201d","Then He called the multitude to Him
 and said to them
 \u201cHear
 and understand.","\u201cThat which goes into the mouth
 does not defile the man. But that which comes out of the mouth
 defiles the man.\u201d","But He answered and said
 \u201cEvery plant which My Heavenly Father has not planted
 shall be rooted up.","\u201cLet them be. They are the blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind leads the blind
 both shall fall into the ditch.\u201d","Then Jesus said
 \u201cAre you still without understanding?","\u201cDo you not understand that whatever enters into the mouth
 goes into the belly
 and is cast out into the drain?","\u201cBut those things which proceed out of the mouth come from the heart
 and they defile the man.","\u201cFor out of the heart comes evil thoughts
 murders
 adulteries
 fornications
 thefts
 false testimonies
 slanders.","\u201cThese are the things which defile the man. But to eat with unwashed hands
 does not defile the man.\u201d","But He answered
 and said
 \u201cI am not sent
 but to the lost sheep of the House of Israel.\u201d","And He answered
 and said
 \u201cIt is not good to take the children\u2019s bread and cast it to the dogs.\u201d","Then Jesus answered
 and said to her
 \u201cO
 woman. Great is your faith. Let it be as you desire.\u201d And her daughter was made whole at that hour.","Then Jesus called His disciples to Him
 and said
 \u201cI have compassion on this multitude because they have remained with Me three days now and have had nothing to eat. And I will not let them depart fasting
 lest they faint on the way.\u201d","And Jesus said to them
 \u201cHow many loaves do you have?\u201d And they said
 \u201cSeven
 and a few little fish.\u201d","But He answered
 and said to them
 \u201cWhen it is evening
 you say
 \u2018Fair weather
 for the sky is red.\u2019","And in the morning
 \u2018Storm today. For the sky is red and overcast.\u2019 O
 hypocrites! You can discern the face of the sky. And can you not discern the signs of the times?","\u201cThe wicked and adulterous generation seeks a sign. But there shall be no sign given it
 except that sign of the Prophet Jonah.\u201d So
 He left them and departed.","Then Jesus said to them
 \u201cWatch
 and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\u201d","But Jesus
 knowing it
 said to them
 \u201cO
 you of little faith. Why are you thinking among yourselves
 \u2018because you have brought no bread\u2019?\u201d","Do you still not perceive or remember the five loaves - when there were five thousand - and how many baskets did you take up;","\u201cor the seven loaves - when there were four thousand - and how many baskets did you take up?","\u201cHow do you not understand that what I said to you was not concerning bread
 but that you should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees?\u201d","Now when Jesus came into the region of Caesarea Philippi
 He asked His disciples
 saying
 \u201cWhom do men say that I
 the Son of Man
 am?\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cBut
 whom do you say that I am?\u201d","And Jesus answered
 and said to him
 \u201cBlessed are you
 Simon
 the son of Jonah. For flesh and blood has not revealed it to you
 but my Father Who is in Heaven.","\u201cAnd I also say to you that you are Peter. And upon this rock I will build My Church. And the gates of Hell shall not overcome it.","\u201cAnd I will give to you the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven. And whatever you shall bind upon Earth
 shall be bound in Heaven. And whatever you shall loose on Earth
 shall be loosed in Heaven.\u201d","Then He turned back and said to Peter
 \u201cGet behind me
 Satan! You are a stumbling block to me because you do not understand the things of God
 but the things of men!\u201d","Then Jesus said to His disciples
 \u201cIf anyone will follow Me
 let him forsake himself
 and take up his cross
 and follow Me.","\u201cFor whoever would save his life
 shall lose it. And whoever shall lose his life
 for My sake
 shall find it.","\u201cFor what shall it profit a man if he should win the whole world
 yet he loses his own soul? Or what shall a man give for recompense of his soul?","\u201cFor the Son of Man shall come in the glory of his Father
 with His angels. And then He shall give to everyone according to his deeds.","\u201cTruly I say to you
 some of those who stand here shall not taste death before they have seen the Son of Man come in His Kingdom.\u201d","Then Jesus came and touched them
 and said
 \u201cArise. And do not be afraid.\u201d","And as they came down from the mountain
 Jesus charged them
 saying
 \u201cTell no one of this vision until the Son of Man has risen again from the dead.\u201d","And Jesus answered
 and said to them
 \u201cCertainly Elijah must come first
 and restore all things.","\u201cBut I say to you that Elijah has come already
 and they did not know him. But they have done to him whatever they would. Likewise
 the Son of Man shall also suffer by them.\u201d","Then Jesus answered
 and said
 \u201cO faithless and crooked generation. How long now shall I be with you? How long now shall I bear with you? Bring him here to Me.\u201d","And Jesus said to them
 \u201cBecause of your unbelief. For truly I say to you
 if you have faith as much as is a grain of mustard seed
 you shall say to this mountain
 \u201cMove from here to there
 and it shall move. And nothing shall be impossible to you.","And while they were in Galilee
 Jesus said to them
 \u201cThe Son of Man shall be delivered into the hands of men.","\u201cAnd they shall kill Him. But the third day He shall rise again.\u201d And they were very sorrowful.","He said
 \u201cYes.\u201d And when he had come into the house
 Jesus stopped him
 saying
 \u201cWhat do you think
 Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth take tribute (or temple taxes) - from their children
 or from strangers?","Peter said to Him
 \u201cFrom strangers.\u201d Then Jesus said to him
 \u201cThen the children are free.\u201d","Nevertheless
 so that we should not offend them
 go to the sea and cast in a hook. And take the first fish that comes up. And when you have opened its mouth
 you shall find a coin. Take it
 and give it to them for you and Me.","and said
 \u201cTruly I say to you
 unless you are converted
 and become as little children
 you shall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.","\u201cWhoever
 therefore
 shall humble himself as this little child
 the same is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven.","\u201cAnd whoever shall receive one such little child in My Name
 receives Me.","\u201cBut whoever shall cause one of these little ones who believes in Me to stumble
 it would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck
 and he were drowned in the depths of the sea.","\u201cWoe to the world because of offenses. For it must be that snares shall come. But woe be to the man by whom the stumbling block comes.","\u201cTherefore
 if your hand or your foot causes you to stumble
 cut them off and cast them from you. It is better for you to enter into life lame
 or maimed
 than - having two hands or two feet - to be cast into everlasting fire.","\u201cAnd if your eye causes you to stumble
 pluck it out and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life with one eye
 than (having two eyes) to be cast into hell fire.","\u201cSee that you do not despise one of these little ones. For I say to you that
 in Heaven
 their angels always behold the face of My Father Who is in Heaven.","\u201cWhat do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep
 and one of them goes astray
 does he not leave the ninety- nine
 and go into the mountains
 and seek those which have gone astray?","\u201cAnd if he finds it? Truly I say to you
 he rejoices more over that sheep
 than over the ninety-nine which di not go astray.","\u201cNor is it the will of your Father Who is in Heaven that one of these little ones should perish.","\u201cMoreover
 if your brother trespasses against you
 go and tell him his fault between you and him alone. If he hears you
 you have won your brother.","\u201cBut if he does not hear you
 take one or two with you. So that
 by the mouths of two or three witnesses
 every word may be confirmed.","\u201cAnd if he refuses to hear them
 tell it to the church. And if he refuses to hear the church also
 let him be as a heathen and a tax collector to you.","\u201cTruly I say to you that whatever you bind on Earth shall be bound in Heaven. And whatever you release on Earth
 shall be released in Heaven.","\u201cAgain
 truly I say to you that if two of you shall agree on earth upon anything
 whatever they shall desire shall be given to them by My Father Who is in Heaven.","\u201cFor where two or three are gathered together in My Name
 there I am in the midst of them.\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cI do not say to you
 \u2018Up to seven times\u2019
 but
 \u2018Up to seventy times seven times\u2019.","\u201cTherefore
 the Kingdom of Heaven is like a certain King
 who would take an account of his servants.","\u201cAnd when he had begun to reckon
 one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents.","\u201cAnd because he had nothing to pay
 his lord commanded him to be sold - and his wife
 and children
 and all that he had - and the debt to be paid.","\u201cTherefore
 the servant fell down and worshipped him
 saying
 \u2018Lord
 have patience with me and I will pay you all!\u2019","\u201cThen that servant\u2019s lord had compassion and freed him. And forgave him the debt.","\u201cBut when the servant had departed
 he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii. And he laid hands on him
 and choked him
 saying
 \u2018Pay me that you owe!\u2019","\u201cThen his fellow servant fell down at his feet
 and begged him
 saying
 \u2018Have patience with me
 and I will pay you all!\u2019","\u201cBut he would not. And went and cast him into prison
 until he should pay the debt.","\u201cAnd when his other fellow servants saw what was done
 they were very sorry. And they came and declared to their lord all that was done.","\u201cThen his lord called him
 and said to him
 \u2018O evil servant! I forgave you all that debt
 because you begged me.","\u201c\u2018Ought not you also have had pity on your fellow servant
 even as I had pity on you?\u2019","\u201cSo his lord was angry
 and delivered him to the jailers
 until he should pay all that was due to him.","\u201cSo likewise shall My heavenly Father do to you
 unless you forgive - from your hearts - each one his brother their trespasses.\u201d","And He answered and said to them
 \u201cHave you not read that He Who made them at the beginning
 made them male and female;","\u201cand said
 \u2018For this reason
 a man shall leave father and mother
 and cling to his wife. And those who were two
 shall be one flesh?\u2019","\u201cTherefore
 they are no more two
 but one flesh. Therefore
 do not let man separate that which God has coupled together.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cBecause of the hardness of your heart
 Moses allowed you to divorce your wives. But from the beginning it was not so.","\u201cTherefore
 I say to you that whoever shall divorce his wife and marry another
 unless it is for promiscuity
 commits adultery. And whoever marries a divorcee \u0301
 commits adultery.\u201d","But He said to them
 \u201cAll men cannot receive this thing. Only those to whom it is given.","\u201cFor there are some eunuchs who were so born from their mother\u2019s belly. And there are some eunuchs who are gelded by men. And there be some eunuchs who have gelded themselves for the Kingdom of Heaven. The one who is able to receive this
 let him receive it.\u201d","But Jesus said
 \u201cAllow the little children. And do not forbid them to come to Me. For of such is the Kingdom of Heaven.\u201d","And He said to him
 \u201cWhy did you call me good? There is no one good
 but One
 even God. But if you wish to enter into Life
 keep the Commandments.\u201d","\u201cHe said to Him
 \u201cWhich?\u201d And Jesus said
 \u201cThese: \u2018You shall not kill\u2019. \u2018You shall not commit adultery\u2019. \u2018You shall not steal\u2019. \u2018You shall not bear false witness\u2019.","\u201c\u2018Honor your father and mother\u2019. And
 \u2018You shall love your neighbor as yourself\u2019.\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cIf you wish to be perfect
 go. Sell what you have and give it to the poor. And you shall have treasure in Heaven. And come and follow Me.\u201d","Then Jesus said to His disciples
 \u201cTruly I say to you that a rich man shall not easily enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.","\u201cAnd again I say to you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God.\u201d","And Jesus looked at them
 and said to them
 \u201cWith men this is impossible. But with God
 all things are possible.\u201d","And Jesus said to them
 \u201cTruly I say to you that when the Son of Man shall sit on the throne of His Majesty
 you who followed Me in the new birth shall also sit upon twelve thrones
 and judge the twelve tribes of Israel.","\u201cAnd whoever shall forsake houses
 or brothers
 or sisters
 or father
 or mother
 or wife
 or children
 or lands
 for My Name\u2019s sake
 shall receive a hundredfold more
 and shall inherit everlasting life.","\u201cBut many that are first
 shall be last. And the last shall be first.","\u201cFor the Kingdom of Heaven is like a certain landowner
 who went out at the dawning of the day to hire laborers into his vineyard.","\u201cAnd he agreed with the laborers for a penny a day and sent them into his vineyard.","\u201cAnd he went out about the third hour
 and saw others standing idle in the marketplace
","\u201cand said to them
 \u201cYou go into my vineyard also. And whatever is right
 I will give you. And they went their way.","\u201cAgain
 he went out about the sixth and ninth hour
 and did likewise.","\u201cAnd he went about the eleventh hour
 and found others standing idle
 and said to them
 \u2018Why do you stand here idle all day?\u2019","\u201cThey said to him
 \u2018Because no one has hired us.\u2019 He said to them
 \u2018You go into my vineyard also. And whatever is right
 that shall you receive.\u2019","\u201cAnd when evening had come
 the master of the vineyard said to his steward
 \u2018Call the laborers and give them their wages
 beginning at the last
 till you come to the first.\u2019","\u201cAnd those who were hired about the eleventh hour
 came. And each received a penny.","\u201cNow when the first came
 they assumed that they would receive more. But each of them also received a penny.","\u201cAnd when they had received it
 they murmured against the master of the house
","\u201csaying
 \u2018These last have only worked one hour
 and you have made them equal to us
 who have borne the burden and heat of the day!\u2019","\u201cAnd he answered one of them
 saying
 \u2018Friend
 I do you no wrong. Did you not agree with me for a penny?","\u2018Take that which is yours and go your way. I will give to this last as much as to you.","\u2018Is it not lawful for me to do as I will with my own? Is your eye evil because I am good?\u2019","\u201cSo the last shall be first
 and the first last. For many are called
 but few chosen.\u201d","\u201cBehold
 we go up to Jerusalem. And the Son of Man shall be delivered to the chief priests
 and to the scribes. And they shall condemn Him to death
","\u201cand shall deliver Him to the Gentiles - to mock
 and to scourge
 and to crucify. But the third day
 He shall rise again.\u201d","\u201cAnd he said to her
 \u201cWhat do you wish?\u201d She said to him
 \u201cGrant that these
 my two sons
 may sit - the one at Your right hand and the other at Your left hand - in Your Kingdom.\u201d","And Jesus answered
 and said
 \u201cYe do not know what you ask. Are you able to drink from the cup from which I shall drink
 and to be baptized with the baptism with which I shall be baptized? They said to Him
 \u201cWe are able.\u201d","Therefore Jesus called them to Him
 and said
 \u201cYou know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them. And those who are great
 exercise authority over them.","\u201cBut it shall not be so among you. But whoever will be great among you
 let him be your servant.","\u201cAnd whoever will be chief among you
 let him be your servant;","\u201cjust as the Son of Man did not come to be served
 but to serve
 and to give His life for the ransom of many.\u201d","Then Jesus stood still
 and called them
 and said
 \u201cWhat would you have Me do to you?","saying to them
 \u201cGo into the town in front of you
 and soon you shall find a donkey bound
 and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them to Me.","\u201cAnd if anyone says anything to you
 say that the Lord has need of them. And immediately he will let them go.\u201d","and said to them
 \u201cIt is written! My house shall be called the House of Prayer! But you have made it a den of thieves!\u201d","and said to Him
 \u201cDo You hear what they say?\u201d And Jesus said to them
 \u201cYes. Have you never read
 \u2018By the mouth of children and infants You have made perfect the praise\u2019?\u201d","And seeing a fig tree on the way
 He came to it. And finding nothing on it but leaves
 He said to it
 \u201cMay fruit never grow on you again.\u201d And immediately the fig tree withered.","And Jesus answered and said to them
 \u201cTruly I say to you
 if you have faith and do not doubt
 you shall not only do this to the fig tree
 but it shall also be done if you say to this mountain

 and cast yourself into the sea\u2019.","\u201cAnd whatever you shall ask in prayer - if you believe - you shall receive it.\u201d","Then Jesus answered
 and said to them
 \u201cI will also ask of you a certain thing which
 if you tell me
 I will likewise tell you by what authority I do these things.","\u201cThe baptism of John. From where did it come - from Heaven or from men?\u201d Then they reasoned among themselves
 saying
 \u201cIf we shall say
 \u2018From Heaven\u2019
 He will say to us
 \u2018Why then did you not believe him?\u2019","Then they answered Jesus
 and said
 \u201cWe cannot tell.\u201d And He said to them
 \u201cNor will I tell you by what authority I do these things.","\u201cBut what do you think? A man had two sons
 and came to the elder
 and said
 \u2018Son
 go and work today in my vineyard.\u2019","\u201cBut he answered
 and said
 \u2018I will not.\u2019 But later he changed his mind and went.","\u201cThen he came to the second and said likewise. And he answered
 and said
 \u2018I will
 sir.\u2019 But he did not go.","\u201cWhich of the two did the will of the father?\u201d They said to Him
 \u201cThe first.\u201d Jesus said to them
 \u201cTruly I say to you that the tax collectors and the prostitutes go before you into the Kingdom of God.","\u201cFor John came to you in the way of righteousness
 and you did not believe him. But the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. And you
 though you saw it
 were not moved with repentance afterward
 so that you might believe him.","\u201cHear another parable. There was a certain landowner who planted a vineyard and fenced it in. And he made a winepress therein
 and built a tower
 and let it out to tenant farmers
 and went away to a strange country.","\u201cAnd when the time of the fruit drew near
 he sent his servants to the farmers to receive the fruits thereof.","\u201cAnd the farmers took his servants and beat one
 killed another
 and stoned another.","\u201cAgain
 he sent other servants (more than the first) and they did likewise to them.","\u201cBut last of all he sent his own son to them
 saying
 \u2018They will revere my son\u2019.","\u201cBut when the farmers saw the son
 they said among themselves
 \u2018This is the heir. Come
 let us kill him. And let us take his inheritance.\u2019","\u201cSo they took him
 and cast him out of the vineyard
 and killed him.","\u201cTherefore
 when the Lord of the vineyard shall come
 what will he do to those farmers?\u201d","They said to Him
 \u201cHe will cruelly destroy those wicked men
 and will let out his vineyard to other farmers who shall deliver the fruits to him in their seasons.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cHave you never read in the Scriptures
 \u2018The stone which the builders refused
 the same is made the Cornerstone. This was the Lord\u2019s doing
 and it is marvelous in our eyes\u2019?","\u201cTherefore I say to you the Kingdom of God shall be taken from you and shall be given to a nation which shall bring forth the fruits thereof.","\u201cAnd the one who shall fall on this stone
 shall be broken. But on whomever it shall fall
 it will grind to powder.","\u201cThe Kingdom of Heaven is like a certain king who made a marriage feast for his son.","\u201cAnd he sent forth his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding. But they would not come.","\u201cAgain
 he sent forth other servants
 saying
 \u2018Tell those who are invited
 \u201cBehold
 I have prepared my dinner. My oxen and my fatted calves are killed
 and all things are ready. Come to the marriage\u201d.\u2019","\u201cBut they made light of it
 and went their ways - one to his farm
 and another about his business.","\u201cAnd the rest took his servants
 and treated them sharply
 and killed them.","\u201cBut when the king heard it
 he was angry
 and sent forth his warriors
 and destroyed those murderers
 and burnt up their city.","\u201cThen he said to his servants
 \u2018Truly the wedding is prepared. But those who were invited were not worthy.","\u201c\u2018Therefore
 go out into the streets. And as many as you find
 invite them to the marriage.\u2019","\u201cSo those servants went out into the streets
 and gathered together everyone they found
 both good and bad. So
 the wedding was furnished with guests.","\u201cThen the king came in to see the guests and saw a man there who did not have on a wedding garment.","\u201cAnd he said to him
 \u2018Friend
 how did you get in here without a wedding garment?\u2019 And he was speechless.","\u201cThen the king said to the servants
 \u201cBind him hand and foot. Take him away and cast him into the outer darkness. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.","\u201cFor many are called
 but few chosen.\u201d","But Jesus perceived their wickedness
 and said
 \u201cWhy do you test Me
 hypocrites?","\u201cShow Me the money for the tribute.\u201d And they brought Him a coin.","And He said to them
 \u201cWhose image and inscription are these?\u201d","They said to Him

 \u201cTherefore
 give to Caesar those things which are Caesar\u2019s. And give to God those things which are God\u2019s.\u201d","Then Jesus answered
 and said to them
 \u201cYou are deceived
 not knowing the Scriptures
 nor the power of God.","\u201cFor in the resurrection they neither marry wives
 nor are wives bestowed in marriage. But they are as the angels of God in Heaven.","\u201cAnd concerning the resurrection of the dead
 have you not read what is spoken to you from God

","\u201c\u2018I am the God of Abraham
 and the God of Isaac
 and the God of Jacob\u2019? God is not the God of the dead
 but of the living.\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cYou shall love the Lord your God with all thine heart
 with all your soul
 and with all your mind.","\u201cThis is the first and the greatest Commandment.","\u201cAnd the second is like this
 \u201cYou shall love your neighbor as yourself.","\u201cOn these two Commandments hang the whole Law and the Prophets.\u201d","saying
 \u201cWhat do you think of Christ? Whose son is He?\u201d They said to him

","\u2018The Lord said to my Lord

 then
 David calls Him Lord

 \u201cThe scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses\u2019 seat.","\u201cTherefore
 all of whatever they ask you to observe
 observe and do. But do not imitate their deeds
 for they do not do as they say.","\u201cFor they bind heavy burdens
 and hard to bear
 and lay them on men\u2019s shoulders. But they themselves will not lift a finger to move them.","\u201cThey do all their works to be seen by men. For they make their phylacteries broad
 and the fringes of their garments long.","\u201cAnd they love the chief place at feasts
 and to have the chief seats in the assemblies;","\u201cand greetings in the markets
 and to be called by men
 \u2018Rabbi
 Rabbi.\u2019","\u201cBut do not be called
 \u2018Rabbi\u2019. For One is your Master - Christ

 Hypocrites! For you traverse sea and land to make one proselyte. And when he is made
 you make him twofold more a child of hell than you yourselves!","\u201cWoe to you

 it is nothing. But whoever swears by the offering upon it

 the offering or the altar which sanctifies the offering?","\u201cTherefore

 swears by it and by all things thereupon.","\u201cAnd whoever swears by the Temple
 swears by it and by Him Who dwells therein.","\u201cAnd the one who swears by Heaven
 swears by the throne of God and by Him Who sits thereupon.","\u201cWoe to you

 I send to you Prophets

 your house shall be left to you desolate.","\u201cFor I say to you
 you shall not see Me again until you say

 and rumors of wars. See that you are not troubled. For all these things must happen. But the end is not yet.","\u201cFor nation shall rise against nation
 and realm against realm. And there shall be famine
 and pestilence
 and earthquakes in diverse places.","\u201cAll these are but the beginning of sorrows.","\u201cThen they shall deliver you up to tribulation and shall kill you. And you shall be hated by all nations
 for My Name\u2019s sake.","\u201cAnd then shall many be offended
 and shall betray one another

 the love of many shall be cold.","\u201cBut the one who endures to the end
 he shall be saved.","\u201cAnd this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached through the whole world
 for a witness to all nations. And then the end shall come.","\u201cTherefore
 when you shall see the Abomination of Desolation (spoken of by Daniel the Prophet) set in the Holy Place (let the one who reads consider it.)","\u201cThen let those who are in Judea
 flee into the mountains.","\u201cLet the one who is on the housetop
 not come down to fetch anything out of his house.","\u201cAnd the one who is in the field
 let him not go back to fetch his clothes.","\u201cThen woe to those who are with child
 and to those who give suck in those days.","\u201cBut pray that your flight is not in the winter
 nor on the Sabbath.","\u201cFor then shall be great tribulation

 \u2018Give us some of your oil. For our lamps are out.\u2019","\u201cBut the wise answered

 \u2018No

 and said
 \u2018Truly I say to you

 watch. For you know neither the day nor the hour when the Son of Man will come.","\u201cFor the Kingdom of Heaven is as a man who
 going into a strange country
 called his servants and handed over his goods to them.","\u201cAnd to one he gave five talents

 the one who received two
 gained another two.","\u201cBut the one who received the one

 the master of those servants came and settled with them.","\u201cThen the one who had received five talents came
 and brought another five talents

 I have gained another five more talents with them.\u2019","\u201cThen his master said to him
 \u2018Well done

 the one who had received two talents came
 and said
 \u2018Master

 I have gained another two talents more.\u2019","\u201cHis master said to him
 \u2018Well done

 and said
 \u2018Master

 I was afraid
 and went and hid your talent in the earth. Behold
 you have what is yours.\u2019","\u201cAnd his master answered
 and said to him
 \u2018You evil and slothful servant! You knew that I reap where I did not sow and gather where I did not scatter.","\u201c\u2018Therefore
 you ought to have put my money in the bank. And then at my coming I would have received my own with interest.","\u201c\u2018Therefore
 take the talent from him and give it to him who has ten talents.","\u201c\u2018For to everyone who has
 it shall be given

 even that he has shall be taken away.","\u201c\u2018Therefore

 and say to them

 knowing it

 \u201cWhy do you trouble the woman? For she has done a good work for Me.","\u201cFor you have the poor with you always. But Me you shall not have always.","\u201cFor in pouring this ointment on My body
 she did it for My burial.","\u201cTruly I say to you

 He said
 \u201cTruly I say to you that one of you shall betray Me.\u201d","And He answered and said
 \u201cThe one who dipped his hand in the dish with Me

 as it is written of Him. But woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed. It had been good for that man if he had never been born.\u201d","\u201cThen Judas (who betrayed Him) answered
 and said
 \u201cIs it me
 Master?\u201d He said to him
 \u201cYou have said it.\u201d","And as they ate
 Jesus took the bread. And when He had blessed it
 He broke it
 and gave it to the disciples
 and said
 \u201cTake. Eat. This is My body.\u201d","Also He took the cup. And when He had given thanks
 He gave it to them

 \u201cDrink all of it.","\u201cFor this is My blood of the New Testament
 which is shed for many
 for the remission of sins.","\u201cI say to you that I will not drink from the fruit of the vine again until that Day when I shall drink it new with you in my Father\u2019s Kingdom.\u201d","Then said Jesus to them
 \u201cAll of you will fall away from Me this night. For it is written
 \u2018I will strike the Shepherd

 I will go before you into Galilee.\u201d","Jesus said to him

 \u201cMy soul is very heavy
 even to the death. Wait here

 He came to the disciples
 and found them asleep

 \u201cWhat?! Could you not watch with Me one hour?!","\u201cWatch
 and pray
 so that you do not enter into temptation. The spirit is indeed ready
 but the flesh is weak.\u201d","Again He went away a second time

 and taking your rest? Behold
 the hour is at hand. And the Son of Man is given into the hands of sinners.","\u201cRise. Let us go. Behold
 the one who betrays Me is here.\u201d","Then Jesus said to him
 \u201cFriend
 why have you come?\u201d Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and took Him.","Then Jesus said to him
 \u201cPut your sword back in its place. For all that take up the sword
 shall perish with the sword.","\u201cOr do you think that I cannot now pray to My Father
 and He will give Me more than twelve legions of angels?","\u201cHow then would the Scriptures be fulfilled which say that it must be so?\u201d","At that time
 Jesus said to the multitude
 \u201cYou have come out as against a thief
 with swords and clubs to take Me. Every day I sat among you
 teaching in the Temple

 \u201cYou have said it. Nevertheless
 I say to you

 and coming in the clouds of the heaven.","Then Peter remembered the words of Jesus
 Who had said to him
 \u201cBefore the cock crows you shalt deny Me three times. So
 he went out and wept bitterly.","And Jesus stood before the governor

 saying
 \u201cAre You the King of the Jews?\u201d Jesus said to him

 \u2018Whoever divorces his wife

 they have received their reward. ","But when you pray
 go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.","\u201cAnd in praying do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do; for they think that they will be heard for their many words.","Do not be like them
 for your Father knows what you need before you ask him. ","Pray then like this: Our Father who art in heaven
 Hallowed be thy name.","Thy kingdom come
 Thy will be done
 On earth as it is in heaven.","Give us this day our daily bread;","And forgive us our debts
 As we also have forgiven our debtors;","And lead us not into temptation
 But deliver us from evil.","For if you forgive men their trespasses
 your heavenly Father also will forgive you; ","but if you do not forgive men their trespasses
 neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.","\u201cAnd when you fast
 do not look dismal
 like the hypocrites
 for they disfigure their faces that their fasting may be seen by men. Truly
 I say to you
 they have received their reward. ","But when you fast
 anoint your head and wash your face
 ","that your fasting may not be seen by men but by your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.","\u201cDo not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth
 where moth and rust consume and where thieves break in and steal
 ","but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven
 where neither moth nor rust consumes and where thieves do not break in and steal. ","For where your treasure is
 there will your heart be also.","\u201cThe eye is the lamp of the body. So
 if your eye is sound
 your whole body will be full of light; ","but if your eye is not sound
 your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light in you is darkness
 how great is the darkness!","\u201cNo one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other
 or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.","\u201cTherefore I tell you
 do not be anxious about your life
 what you shall eat or what you shall drink
 nor about your body
 what you shall put on. Is not life more than food
 and the body more than clothing? ","Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns
 and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? ","And which of you by being anxious can add one cubit to his span of life?","And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field
 how they grow; they neither toil nor spin; ","yet I tell you
 even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. ","But if God so clothes the grass of the field
 which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven
 will he not much more clothe you
 O men of little faith? ","Therefore do not be anxious
 saying
 \u2018What shall we eat?\u2019 or \u2018What shall we drink?\u2019 or \u2018What shall we wear?\u2019 ","For the Gentiles seek all these things; and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all.","But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness
 and all these things shall be yours as well.","\u201cTherefore do not be anxious about tomorrow
 for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Let the day\u2019s own trouble be sufficient for the day.","\u201cJudge not
 that you be not judged. ","For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged
 and the measure you give will be the measure you get. ","Why do you see the speck that is in your brother\u2019s eye
 but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? ","Or how can you say to your brother
 \u2018Let me take the speck out of your eye
\u2019 when there is the log in your own eye? ","You hypocrite
 first take the log out of your own eye
 and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother\u2019s eye.","\u201cDo not give dogs what is holy; and do not throw your pearls before swine

 and it will be given you; seek
 and you will find; knock
 and it will be opened to you. ","For every one who asks receives
 and he who seeks finds

 if his son asks him for bread
 will give him a stone? ","Or if he asks for a fish
 will give him a serpent? ","If you then
 who are evil
 know how to give good gifts to your children

 do so to them; for this is the law and the prophets.","\u201cEnter by the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is easy

 who come to you in sheep\u2019s clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves. ","You will know them by their fruits. Are grapes gathered from thorns
 or figs from thistles? ","So
 every sound tree bears good fruit
 but the bad tree bears evil fruit. ","A sound tree cannot bear evil fruit
 nor can a bad tree bear good fruit. ","Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.","Thus you will know them by their fruits.","\u201cNot every one who says to me
 \u2018Lord
 Lord
\u2019 shall enter the kingdom of heaven
 but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. ","On that day many will say to me
 \u2018Lord
 Lord

 and do many mighty works in your name?\u2019 ","And then will I declare to them
 \u2018I never knew you; depart from me

 many will come from east and west and sit at table with Abraham
 Isaac

 \u201cWhy are you afraid

 the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea
 and perished in the waters. ","And behold
 they brought to him a paralytic
 lying on his bed; and when Jesus saw their faith he said to the paralytic
 \u201cTake heart
 my son; your sins are forgiven.\u201d ","But Jesus
 knowing their thoughts
 said
 \u201cWhy do you think evil in your hearts? ","For which is easier
 to say
 \u2018Your sins are forgiven
\u2019 or to say
 \u2018Rise and walk\u2019? ","But that you may know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins\u201d\u2014he then said to the paralytic\u2014\u201cRise

 he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax office; and he said to him

 he said

 \u201cCan the wedding guests mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? The days will come
 when the bridegroom is taken away from them

 I say to you
 it shall be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom and Gomor\u2032rah than for that town.","\u201cBehold
 I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves; so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves. ","Beware of men; for they will deliver you up to councils
 and flog you in their synagogues

 to bear testimony before them and the Gentiles. ","When they deliver you up
 do not be anxious how you are to speak or what you are to say; for what you are to say will be given to you in that hour; ","for it is not you who speak

 I say to you
 among those born of women there has risen no one greater than John the Baptist; yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. ","From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has suffered violence

 \u2018He has a demon\u2019; ","the Son of man came eating and drinking

 \u2018Behold

 and are guiltless? ","I tell you
 something greater than the temple is here. ","And if you had known what this means
 \u2018I desire mercy

\u2019 you would not have condemned the guiltless. ","For the Son of man is lord of the sabbath.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cWhat man of you
 if he has one sheep and it falls into a pit on the sabbath

 \u201cStretch out your hand.\u201d And the man stretched it out

 whole like the other. ","Knowing their thoughts
 he said to them
 \u201cEvery kingdom divided against itself is laid waste

 he is divided against himself; how then will his kingdom stand? ","And if I cast out demons by Be-el\u2032zebul
 by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges. ","But if it is by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons
 then the kingdom of God has come upon you. ","Or how can one enter a strong man\u2019s house and plunder his goods
 unless he first binds the strong man? Then indeed he may plunder his house. ","He who is not with me is against me

 every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men

 and its fruit good; or make the tree bad

 \u201cAn evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign; but no sign shall be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. ","For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale

 he passes through waterless places seeking rest

 swept
 and put in order. ","Then he goes and brings with him seven other spirits more evil than himself

 behold
 his mother and his brothers stood outside
 asking to speak to him. ","But he replied to the man who told him
 \u201cWho is my mother

 he said
 \u201cHere are my mother and my brothers! ","For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother

 saying: \u201cA sower went out to sow. ","And as he sowed
 some seeds fell along the path
 and the birds came and devoured them. ","Other seeds fell on rocky ground
 where they had not much soil
 and immediately they sprang up
 since they had no depth of soil
 ","but when the sun rose they were scorched; and since they had no root they withered away.","Other seeds fell upon thorns
 and the thorns grew up and choked them. ","Other seeds fell on good soil and brought forth grain
 some a hundredfold
 some sixty
 some thirty. ","He who has ears
 let him hear.\u201d","And he answered them
 \u201cTo you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven
 but to them it has not been given. ","For to him who has will more be given
 and he will have abundance; but from him who has not
 even what he has will be taken away. ","This is why I speak to them in parables
 because seeing they do not see
 and hearing they do not hear
 nor do they understand. ","With them indeed is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says: \u2018You shall indeed hear but never understand
 and you shall indeed see but never perceive.","For this people\u2019s heart has grown dull
 and their ears are heavy of hearing
 and their eyes they have closed
 lest they should perceive with their eyes
 and hear with their ears
 and understand with their heart
 and turn for me to heal them.\u2019","But blessed are your eyes
 for they see
 and your ears
 for they hear. ","Truly
 I say to you
 many prophets and righteous men longed to see what you see
 and did not see it
 and to hear what you hear
 and did not hear it.","\u201cHear then the parable of the sower.","When any one hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it
 the evil one comes and snatches away what is sown in his heart; this is what was sown along the path. ","As for what was sown on rocky ground
 this is he who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy; ","yet he has no root in himself
 but endures for a while
 and when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word
 immediately he falls away. ","As for what was sown among thorns
 this is he who hears the word
 but the cares of the world and the delight in riches choke the word
 and it proves unfruitful. ","As for what was sown on good soil
 this is he who hears the word and understands it; he indeed bears fruit
 and yields
 in one case a hundredfold
 in another sixty
 and in another thirty.\u201d","Another parable he put before them
 saying
 \u201cThe kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field; ","but while men were sleeping
 his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat
 and went away. ","So when the plants came up and bore grain
 then the weeds appeared also. ","And the servants of the householder came and said to him
 \u2018Sir
 did you not sow good seed in your field? How then has it weeds?\u2019 ","He said to them
 \u2018An enemy has done this.\u2019 The servants said to him
 \u2018Then do you want us to go and gather them?\u2019 ","But he said
 \u2018No; lest in gathering the weeds you root up the wheat along with them. ","Let both grow together until the harvest; and at harvest time I will tell the reapers
 Gather the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned
 but gather the wheat into my barn.\u2019\u201d","Another parable he put before them
 saying
 \u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his field; ","it is the smallest of all seeds
 but when it has grown it is the greatest of shrubs and becomes a tree
 so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches.\u201d","He told them another parable. \u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour
 till it was all leavened.\u201d","He answered
 \u201cHe who sows the good seed is the Son of man; ","the field is the world
 and the good seed means the sons of the kingdom; the weeds are the sons of the evil one
 ","and the enemy who sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the close of the age
 and the reapers are angels. ","Just as the weeds are gathered and burned with fire
 so will it be at the close of the age. ","The Son of man will send his angels
 and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all evildoers
 ","and throw them into the furnace of fire; there men will weep and gnash their teeth.","Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears
 let him hear.","\u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field
 which a man found and covered up; then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.","\u201cAgain
 the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls
 ","who
 on finding one pearl of great value
 went and sold all that he had and bought it.","\u201cAgain
 the kingdom of heaven is like a net which was thrown into the sea and gathered fish of every kind; ","when it was full
 men drew it ashore and sat down and sorted the good into vessels but threw away the bad. ","So it will be at the close of the age. The angels will come out and separate the evil from the righteous
 ","and throw them into the furnace of fire; there men will weep and gnash their teeth.","\u201cHave you understood all this?\u201d They said to him
 \u201cYes.\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cTherefore every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old.\u201d","And they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them
 \u201cA prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own house.\u201d ","Jesus said
 \u201cThey need not go away; you give them something to eat.\u201d ","And he said
 \u201cBring them here to me.\u201d ","But immediately he spoke to them
 saying
 \u201cTake heart
 it is I; have no fear.\u201d","He said
 \u201cCome.\u201d So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water and came to Jesus; ","Jesus immediately reached out his hand and caught him
 saying to him
 \u201cO man of little faith
 why did you doubt?\u201d ","He answered them
 \u201cAnd why do you transgress the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition? ","For God commanded
 \u2018Honor your father and your mother
\u2019 and
 \u2018He who speaks evil of father or mother
 let him surely die.\u2019 ","But you say
 \u2018If any one tells his father or his mother
 What you would have gained from me is given to God
 he need not honor his father.\u2019 ","So
 for the sake of your tradition
 you have made void the word of God. ","You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you
 when he said:","\u2018This people honors me with their lips
 but their heart is far from me;","in vain do they worship me
 teaching as doctrines the precepts of men.\u2019\u201d","And he called the people to him and said to them
 \u201cHear and understand: ","not what goes into the mouth defiles a man

 this defiles a man.\u201d ","He answered
 \u201cEvery plant which my heavenly Father has not planted will be rooted up. ","Let them alone; they are blind guides. And if a blind man leads a blind man
 both will fall into a pit.\u201d ","And he said
 \u201cAre you also still without understanding? ","Do you not see that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the stomach
 and so passes on? ","But what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart
 and this defiles a man. ","For out of the heart come evil thoughts
 murder
 adultery
 fornication
 theft
 false witness
 slander. ","These are what defile a man; but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a man.\u201d","He answered
 \u201cI was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\u201d ","And he answered
 \u201cIt is not fair to take the children\u2019s bread and throw it to the dogs.\u201d ","Then Jesus answered her
 \u201cO woman
 great is your faith! Be it done for you as you desire.\u201d And her daughter was healed instantly.","Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said
 \u201cI have compassion on the crowd
 because they have been with me now three days
 and have nothing to eat; and I am unwilling to send them away hungry
 lest they faint on the way.\u201d ","And Jesus said to them
 \u201cHow many loaves have you?\u201d They said
 \u201cSeven
 and a few small fish.\u201d ","He answered them
 \u201cWhen it is evening
 you say
 \u2018It will be fair weather; for the sky is red.\u2019 ","And in the morning
 \u2018It will be stormy today
 for the sky is red and threatening.\u2019 You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky
 but you cannot interpret the signs of the times. ","An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign
 but no sign shall be given to it except the sign of Jonah.\u201d So he left them and departed.","Jesus said to them
 \u201cTake heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sad\u2032ducees.\u201d ","But Jesus
 aware of this
 said
 \u201cO men of little faith
 why do you discuss among yourselves the fact that you have no bread? ","Do you not yet perceive? Do you not remember the five loaves of the five thousand
 and how many baskets you gathered? ","Or the seven loaves of the four thousand
 and how many baskets you gathered? ","How is it that you fail to perceive that I did not speak about bread? Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sad\u2032ducees.\u201d","Now when Jesus came into the district of Caesare\u2032a Philippi
 he asked his disciples
 \u201cWho do men say that the Son of man is?\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cBut who do you say that I am?\u201d ","And Jesus answered him
 \u201cBlessed are you
 Simon Bar-Jona! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you
 but my Father who is in heaven. ","And I tell you
 you are Peter
 and on this rock I will build my church
 and the powers of death shall not prevail against it. ","I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven
 and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven
 and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\u201d ","But he turned and said to Peter
 \u201cGet behind me
 Satan! You are a hindrance to me; for you are not on the side of God
 but of men.\u201d","Then Jesus told his disciples
 \u201cIf any man would come after me
 let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. ","For whoever would save his life will lose it
 and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it. ","For what will it profit a man
 if he gains the whole world and forfeits his life? Or what shall a man give in return for his life? ","For the Son of man is to come with his angels in the glory of his Father
 and then he will repay every man for what he has done. ","Truly
 I say to you
 there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.\u201d","But Jesus came and touched them
 saying
 \u201cRise
 and have no fear.\u201d ","And as they were coming down the mountain
 Jesus commanded them
 \u201cTell no one the vision
 until the Son of man is raised from the dead.\u201d ","He replied
 \u201cEli\u2032jah does come
 and he is to restore all things; ","but I tell you that Eli\u2032jah has already come
 and they did not know him
 but did to him whatever they pleased. So also the Son of man will suffer at their hands.\u201d ","And Jesus answered
 \u201cO faithless and perverse generation
 how long am I to be with you? How long am I to bear with you? Bring him here to me.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cBecause of your little faith. For truly
 I say to you
 if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed
 you will say to this mountain
 \u2018Move from here to there
\u2019 and it will move; and nothing will be impossible to you.\u201d","As they were gathering in Galilee
 Jesus said to them
 \u201cThe Son of man is to be delivered into the hands of men
 ","and they will kill him
 and he will be raised on the third day.\u201d And they were greatly distressed.","He said
 \u201cYes.\u201d And when he came home
 Jesus spoke to him first
 saying
 \u201cWhat do you think
 Simon? From whom do kings of the earth take toll or tribute? From their sons or from others?\u201d ","And when he said
 \u201cFrom others
\u201d Jesus said to him
 \u201cThen the sons are free. ","However
 not to give offense to them
 go to the sea and cast a hook
 and take the first fish that comes up
 and when you open its mouth you will find a shekel; take that and give it to them for me and for yourself.\u201d","and said
 \u201cTruly
 I say to you
 unless you turn and become like children
 you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. ","Whoever humbles himself like this child
 he is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.","\u201cWhoever receives one such child in my name receives me;","but whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin
 it would be better for him to have a great millstone fastened round his neck and to be drowned in the depth of the sea.","\u201cWoe to the world for temptations to sin! For it is necessary that temptations come
 but woe to the man by whom the temptation comes! ","And if your hand or your foot causes you to sin
 cut it off and throw it away; it is better for you to enter life maimed or lame than with two hands or two feet to be thrown into the eternal fire. ","And if your eye causes you to sin
 pluck it out and throw it away; it is better for you to enter life with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into the hell of fire.","\u201cSee that you do not despise one of these little ones; for I tell you that in heaven their angels always behold the face of my Father who is in heaven.","What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep
 and one of them has gone astray
 does he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go in search of the one that went astray? ","And if he finds it
 truly
 I say to you
 he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that never went astray. ","So it is not the will of my Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.","\u201cIf your brother sins against you
 go and tell him his fault
 between you and him alone. If he listens to you
 you have gained your brother. ","But if he does not listen
 take one or two others along with you
 that every word may be confirmed by the evidence of two or three witnesses. ","If he refuses to listen to them
 tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church
 let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector. ","Truly
 I say to you
 whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven
 and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. ","Again I say to you
 if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask
 it will be done for them by my Father in heaven. ","For where two or three are gathered in my name
 there am I in the midst of them.\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cI do not say to you seven times
 but seventy times seven.","\u201cTherefore the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his servants.","When he began the reckoning
 one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents; ","and as he could not pay
 his lord ordered him to be sold
 with his wife and children and all that he had
 and payment to be made. ","So the servant fell on his knees
 imploring him
 \u2018Lord
 have patience with me
 and I will pay you everything.\u2019 ","And out of pity for him the lord of that servant released him and forgave him the debt.","But that same servant
 as he went out
 came upon one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii; and seizing him by the throat he said
 \u2018Pay what you owe.\u2019 ","So his fellow servant fell down and besought him
 \u2018Have patience with me
 and I will pay you.\u2019 ","He refused and went and put him in prison till he should pay the debt.","When his fellow servants saw what had taken place
 they were greatly distressed
 and they went and reported to their lord all that had taken place. ","Then his lord summoned him and said to him
 \u2018You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you besought me; ","and should not you have had mercy on your fellow servant
 as I had mercy on you?\u2019 ","And in anger his lord delivered him to the jailers
 till he should pay all his debt. ","So also my heavenly Father will do to every one of you
 if you do not forgive your brother from your heart.\u201d","He answered
 \u201cHave you not read that he who made them from the beginning made them male and female
 ","and said
 \u2018For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife
 and the two shall become one flesh\u2019? ","So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together
 let not man put asunder.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cFor your hardness of heart Moses allowed you to divorce your wives
 but from the beginning it was not so. ","And I say to you: whoever divorces his wife
 except for unchastity
 and marries another
 commits adultery.\u201d","But he said to them
 \u201cNot all men can receive this saying
 but only those to whom it is given. ","For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth
 and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men
 and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. He who is able to receive this
 let him receive it.\u201d","but Jesus said
 \u201cLet the children come to me
 and do not hinder them; for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven.\u201d ","And he said to him
 \u201cWhy do you ask me about what is good? One there is who is good. If you would enter life
 keep the commandments.\u201d ","He said to him
 \u201cWhich?\u201d And Jesus said
 \u201cYou shall not kill
 You shall not commit adultery
 You shall not steal
 You shall not bear false witness
 ","Honor your father and mother
 and
 You shall love your neighbor as yourself.\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cIf you would be perfect
 go
 sell what you possess and give to the poor
 and you will have treasure in heaven; and come
 follow me.\u201d ","And Jesus said to his disciples
 \u201cTruly
 I say to you
 it will be hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. ","Again I tell you
 it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.\u201d ","But Jesus looked at them and said to them
 \u201cWith men this is impossible
 but with God all things are possible.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cTruly
 I say to you
 in the new world
 when the Son of man shall sit on his glorious throne
 you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones
 judging the twelve tribes of Israel. ","And every one who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands
 for my name\u2019s sake
 will receive a hundredfold
 and inherit eternal life. ","But many that are first will be last
 and the last first.","\u201cFor the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.","After agreeing with the laborers for a denarius a day
 he sent them into his vineyard. ","And going out about the third hour he saw others standing idle in the market place;","and to them he said
 \u2018You go into the vineyard too
 and whatever is right I will give you.\u2019 So they went. ","Going out again about the sixth hour and the ninth hour
 he did the same. ","And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing; and he said to them
 \u2018Why do you stand here idle all day?\u2019 ","They said to him
 \u2018Because no one has hired us.\u2019 He said to them
 \u2018You go into the vineyard too.\u2019 ","And when evening came
 the owner of the vineyard said to his steward
 \u2018Call the laborers and pay them their wages
 beginning with the last
 up to the first.\u2019 ","And when those hired about the eleventh hour came
 each of them received a denarius. ","Now when the first came
 they thought they would receive more; but each of them also received a denarius. ","And on receiving it they grumbled at the householder
 ","saying
 \u2018These last worked only one hour
 and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat.\u2019 ","But he replied to one of them
 \u2018Friend
 I am doing you no wrong; did you not agree with me for a denarius? ","Take what belongs to you
 and go; I choose to give to this last as I give to you. ","Am I not allowed to do what I choose with what belongs to me? Or do you begrudge my generosity?\u2019","So the last will be first
 and the first last.\u201d","\u201cBehold
 we are going up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes
 and they will condemn him to death
 ","and deliver him to the Gentiles to be mocked and scourged and crucified
 and he will be raised on the third day.\u201d","And he said to her
 \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d She said to him
 \u201cCommand that these two sons of mine may sit
 one at your right hand and one at your left
 in your kingdom.\u201d ","But Jesus answered
 \u201cYou do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am to drink?\u201d They said to him
 \u201cWe are able.\u201d ","But Jesus called them to him and said
 \u201cYou know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them
 and their great men exercise authority over them. ","It shall not be so among you; but whoever would be great among you must be your servant
 ","and whoever would be first among you must be your slave;","even as the Son of man came not to be served but to serve
 and to give his life as a ransom for many.\u201d","And Jesus stopped and called them
 saying
 \u201cWhat do you want me to do for you?\u201d ","saying to them
 \u201cGo into the village opposite you
 and immediately you will find an ass tied
 and a colt with her; untie them and bring them to me. ","If any one says anything to you
 you shall say
 \u2018The Lord has need of them
\u2019 and he will send them immediately.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cIt is written
 \u2018My house shall be called a house of prayer\u2019; but you make it a den of robbers.\u201d","and they said to him
 \u201cDo you hear what these are saying?\u201d And Jesus said to them
 \u201cYes; have you never read
 \u2018Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast brought perfect praise\u2019?\u201d","And seeing a fig tree by the wayside he went to it
 and found nothing on it but leaves only. And he said to it
 \u201cMay no fruit ever come from you again!\u201d And the fig tree withered at once. ","And Jesus answered them
 \u201cTruly
 I say to you
 if you have faith and never doubt
 you will not only do what has been done to the fig tree
 but even if you say to this mountain
 \u2018Be taken up and cast into the sea
\u2019 it will be done. ","And whatever you ask in prayer
 you will receive
 if you have faith.\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cI also will ask you a question; and if you tell me the answer
 then I also will tell you by what authority I do these things. ","The baptism of John
 whence was it? From heaven or from men?\u201d And they argued with one another
 \u201cIf we say
 \u2018From heaven
\u2019 he will say to us
 \u2018Why then did you not believe him?\u2019 ","So they answered Jesus
 \u201cWe do not know.\u201d And he said to them
 \u201cNeither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.","\u201cWhat do you think? A man had two sons; and he went to the first and said
 \u2018Son
 go and work in the vineyard today.\u2019 ","And he answered
 \u2018I will not\u2019; but afterward he repented and went. ","And he went to the second and said the same; and he answered
 \u2018I go
 sir
\u2019 but did not go. ","Which of the two did the will of his father?\u201d They said
 \u201cThe first.\u201d Jesus said to them
 \u201cTruly
 I say to you
 the tax collectors and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you. ","For John came to you in the way of righteousness
 and you did not believe him
 but the tax collectors and the harlots believed him; and even when you saw it
 you did not afterward repent and believe him.","\u201cHear another parable. There was a householder who planted a vineyard
 and set a hedge around it
 and dug a wine press in it
 and built a tower
 and let it out to tenants
 and went into another country. ","When the season of fruit drew near
 he sent his servants to the tenants
 to get his fruit; ","and the tenants took his servants and beat one
 killed another
 and stoned another. ","Again he sent other servants
 more than the first; and they did the same to them. ","Afterward he sent his son to them
 saying
 \u2018They will respect my son.\u2019 ","But when the tenants saw the son
 they said to themselves
 \u2018This is the heir; come
 let us kill him and have his inheritance.\u2019 ","And they took him and cast him out of the vineyard
 and killed him. ","When therefore the owner of the vineyard comes
 what will he do to those tenants?\u201d ","They said to him
 \u201cHe will put those wretches to a miserable death
 and let out the vineyard to other tenants who will give him the fruits in their seasons.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cHave you never read in the scriptures: \u2018The very stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner; this was the Lord\u2019s doing
 and it is marvelous in our eyes\u2019?","Therefore I tell you
 the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a nation producing the fruits of it.\u201d","\u201cThe kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who gave a marriage feast for his son
 ","and sent his servants to call those who were invited to the marriage feast; but they would not come.","Again he sent other servants
 saying
 \u2018Tell those who are invited
 Behold
 I have made ready my dinner
 my oxen and my fat calves are killed
 and everything is ready; come to the marriage feast.\u2019 ","But they made light of it and went off
 one to his farm
 another to his business
 ","while the rest seized his servants
 treated them shamefully
 and killed them. ","The king was angry
 and he sent his troops and destroyed those murderers and burned their city. ","Then he said to his servants
 \u2018The wedding is ready
 but those invited were not worthy. ","Go therefore to the thoroughfares
 and invite to the marriage feast as many as you find.\u2019 ","And those servants went out into the streets and gathered all whom they found
 both bad and good; so the wedding hall was filled with guests.","\u201cBut when the king came in to look at the guests
 he saw there a man who had no wedding garment; ","and he said to him
 \u2018Friend
 how did you get in here without a wedding garment?\u2019 And he was speechless. ","Then the king said to the attendants
 \u2018Bind him hand and foot
 and cast him into the outer darkness; there men will weep and gnash their teeth.\u2019 ","For many are called
 but few are chosen.\u201d","But Jesus
 aware of their malice
 said
 \u201cWhy put me to the test
 you hypocrites? ","Show me the money for the tax.\u201d And they brought him a coin.","And Jesus said to them
 \u201cWhose likeness and inscription is this?\u201d ","They said
 \u201cCaesar\u2019s.\u201d Then he said to them
 \u201cRender therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar\u2019s

 \u201cYou are wrong
 because you know neither the scriptures nor the power of God. ","For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage

 have you not read what was said to you by God
 ","\u2018I am the God of Abraham

 \u201cWhat do you think of the Christ? Whose son is he?\u201d They said to him

 and they will see the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory; ","and he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call
 and they will gather his elect from the four winds
 from one end of heaven to the other.","\u201cFrom the fig tree learn its lesson: as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts forth its leaves
 you know that summer is near. ","So also
 when you see all these things
 you know that he is near
 at the very gates. ","Truly
 I say to you
 this generation will not pass away till all these things take place. ","Heaven and earth will pass away
 but my words will not pass away.","\u201cBut of that day and hour no one knows
 not even the angels of heaven
 nor the Son
 but the Father only. ","As were the days of Noah
 so will be the coming of the Son of man. ","For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking
 marrying and giving in marriage
 until the day when Noah entered the ark
 ","and they did not know until the flood came and swept them all away
 so will be the coming of the Son of man. ","Then two men will be in the field; one is taken and one is left.","Two women will be grinding at the mill; one is taken and one is left.","Watch therefore
 for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming. ","But know this
 that if the householder had known in what part of the night the thief was coming
 he would have watched and would not have let his house be broken into. ","Therefore you also must be ready; for the Son of man is coming at an hour you do not expect.","\u201cWho then is the faithful and wise servant
 whom his master has set over his household
 to give them their food at the proper time? ","Blessed is that servant whom his master when he comes will find so doing.","Truly
 I say to you
 he will set him over all his possessions. ","But if that wicked servant says to himself
 \u2018My master is delayed
\u2019 ","and begins to beat his fellow servants
 and eats and drinks with the drunken
 ","the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know
 ","and will punish him
 and put him with the hypocrites; there men will weep and gnash their teeth.","\u201cThen the kingdom of heaven shall be compared to ten maidens who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom.","Five of them were foolish
 and five were wise. ","For when the foolish took their lamps
 they took no oil with them; ","but the wise took flasks of oil with their lamps.","As the bridegroom was delayed
 they all slumbered and slept. ","But at midnight there was a cry
 \u2018Behold
 the bridegroom! Come out to meet him.\u2019 ","Then all those maidens rose and trimmed their lamps.","And the foolish said to the wise
 \u2018Give us some of your oil
 for our lamps are going out.\u2019 ","But the wise replied
 \u2018Perhaps there will not be enough for us and for you; go rather to the dealers and buy for yourselves.\u2019 ","And while they went to buy
 the bridegroom came
 and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast; and the door was shut. ","Afterward the other maidens came also
 saying
 \u2018Lord
 lord
 open to us.\u2019 ","But he replied
 \u2018Truly
 I say to you
 I do not know you.\u2019 ","Watch therefore
 for you know neither the day nor the hour.","\u201cFor it will be as when a man going on a journey called his servants and entrusted to them his property;","to one he gave five talents
 to another two
 to another one
 to each according to his ability. Then he went away. ","He who had received the five talents went at once and traded with them; and he made five talents more.","So also
 he who had the two talents made two talents more. ","But he who had received the one talent went and dug in the ground and hid his master\u2019s money.","Now after a long time the master of those servants came and settled accounts with them.","And he who had received the five talents came forward
 bringing five talents more
 saying
 \u2018Master
 you delivered to me five talents; here I have made five talents more.\u2019 ","His master said to him
 \u2018Well done
 good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a little
 I will set you over much; enter into the joy of your master.\u2019 ","And he also who had the two talents came forward
 saying
 \u2018Master
 you delivered to me two talents; here I have made two talents more.\u2019 ","His master said to him
 \u2018Well done
 good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a little
 I will set you over much; enter into the joy of your master.\u2019 ","He also who had received the one talent came forward
 saying
 \u2018Master
 I knew you to be a hard man
 reaping where you did not sow
 and gathering where you did not winnow; ","so I was afraid
 and I went and hid your talent in the ground. Here you have what is yours.\u2019 ","But his master answered him
 \u2018You wicked and slothful servant! You knew that I reap where I have not sowed
 and gather where I have not winnowed? ","Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers
 and at my coming I should have received what was my own with interest. ","So take the talent from him
 and give it to him who has the ten talents. ","For to every one who has will more be given
 and he will have abundance; but from him who has not
 even what he has will be taken away. ","And cast the worthless servant into the outer darkness; there men will weep and gnash their teeth.\u2019","\u201cWhen the Son of man comes in his glory
 and all the angels with him
 then he will sit on his glorious throne. ","Before him will be gathered all the nations
 and he will separate them one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats
 ","and he will place the sheep at his right hand
 but the goats at the left. ","Then the King will say to those at his right hand
 \u2018Come
 O blessed of my Father
 inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world; ","for I was hungry and you gave me food
 I was thirsty and you gave me drink
 I was a stranger and you welcomed me
 ","I was naked and you clothed me
 I was sick and you visited me
 I was in prison and you came to me.\u2019 ","Then the righteous will answer him
 \u2018Lord
 when did we see thee hungry and feed thee
 or thirsty and give thee drink? ","And when did we see thee a stranger and welcome thee
 or naked and clothe thee? ","And when did we see thee sick or in prison and visit thee?\u2019","And the King will answer them
 \u2018Truly
 I say to you
 as you did it to one of the least of these my brethren
 you did it to me.\u2019 ","Then he will say to those at his left hand
 \u2018Depart from me
 you cursed
 into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels; ","for I was hungry and you gave me no food
 I was thirsty and you gave me no drink
 ","I was a stranger and you did not welcome me
 naked and you did not clothe me
 sick and in prison and you did not visit me.\u2019 ","Then they also will answer
 \u2018Lord
 when did we see thee hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison
 and did not minister to thee?\u2019 ","Then he will answer them
 \u2018Truly
 I say to you
 as you did it not to one of the least of these
 you did it not to me.\u2019 ","And they will go away into eternal punishment
 but the righteous into eternal life.\u201d","\u201cYou know that after two days the Passover is coming
 and the Son of man will be delivered up to be crucified.\u201d","But Jesus
 aware of this
 said to them
 \u201cWhy do you trouble the woman? For she has done a beautiful thing to me. ","For you always have the poor with you
 but you will not always have me. ","In pouring this ointment on my body she has done it to prepare me for burial.","Truly
 I say to you
 wherever this gospel is preached in the whole world
 what she has done will be told in memory of her.\u201d","He said
 \u201cGo into the city to a certain one
 and say to him
 \u2018The Teacher says
 My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at your house with my disciples.\u2019\u201d ","and as they were eating
 he said
 \u201cTruly
 I say to you
 one of you will betray me.\u201d ","He answered
 \u201cHe who has dipped his hand in the dish with me
 will betray me. ","The Son of man goes as it is written of him
 but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.\u201d ","Judas
 who betrayed him
 said
 \u201cIs it I
 Master?\u201d He said to him
 \u201cYou have said so.\u201d","Now as they were eating
 Jesus took bread
 and blessed
 and broke it
 and gave it to the disciples and said
 \u201cTake
 eat; this is my body.\u201d ","And he took a cup
 and when he had given thanks he gave it to them
 saying
 \u201cDrink of it
 all of you; ","for this is my blood of the covenant
 which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. ","I tell you I shall not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father\u2019s kingdom.\u201d","Then Jesus said to them
 \u201cYou will all fall away because of me this night; for it is written
 \u2018I will strike the shepherd
 and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.\u2019 ","But after I am raised up
 I will go before you to Galilee.\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cTruly
 I say to you
 this very night
 before the cock crows
 you will deny me three times.\u201d ","Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsem\u2032ane
 and he said to his disciples
 \u201cSit here
 while I go yonder and pray.\u201d ","Then he said to them
 \u201cMy soul is very sorrowful
 even to death; remain here
 and watch with me.\u201d ","And going a little farther he fell on his face and prayed
 \u201cMy Father
 if it be possible
 let this cup pass from me; nevertheless
 not as I will
 but as thou wilt.\u201d ","And he came to the disciples and found them sleeping; and he said to Peter
 \u201cSo
 could you not watch with me one hour? ","Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation; the spirit indeed is willing
 but the flesh is weak.\u201d ","Again
 for the second time
 he went away and prayed
 \u201cMy Father
 if this cannot pass unless I drink it
 thy will be done.\u201d ","Then he came to the disciples and said to them
 \u201cAre you still sleeping and taking your rest? Behold
 the hour is at hand
 and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. ","Rise
 let us be going; see
 my betrayer is at hand.\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cFriend
 why are you here?\u201d Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus and seized him. ","Then Jesus said to him
 \u201cPut your sword back into its place; for all who take the sword will perish by the sword. ","Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father
 and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of angels? ","But how then should the scriptures be fulfilled
 that it must be so?\u201d ","At that hour Jesus said to the crowds
 \u201cHave you come out as against a robber
 with swords and clubs to capture me? Day after day I sat in the temple teaching
 and you did not seize me. ","But all this has taken place
 that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.\u201d Then all the disciples forsook him and fled.","Jesus said to him
 \u201cYou have said so. But I tell you
 hereafter you will see the Son of man seated at the right hand of Power
 and coming on the clouds of heaven.\u201d ","And Peter remembered the saying of Jesus
 \u201cBefore the cock crows
 you will deny me three times.\u201d And he went out and wept bitterly.","Now Jesus stood before the governor; and the governor asked him
 \u201cAre you the King of the Jews?\u201d Jesus said
 \u201cYou have said so.\u201d ","And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice
 \u201cEli
 Eli
 la\u2032ma sabach-tha\u2032ni?\u201d that is
 \u201cMy God
 my God
 why hast thou forsaken me?\u201d ","And behold
 Jesus met them and said
 \u201cHail!\u201d And they came up and took hold of his feet and worshiped him. ","Then Jesus said to them
 \u201cDo not be afraid; go and tell my brethren to go to Galilee
 and there they will see me.\u201d","And Jesus came and said to them
 \u201cAll authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. ","Go therefore and make disciples of all nations
 baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit
 ","teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you; and lo
 I am with you always
 to the close of the age.\u201d","But Jesus answered him
 \u201cLet it be so now; for thus it is fitting for us to fulfil all righteousness.\u201d Then he consented. ","But he answered
 \u201cIt is written
 \u2018Man shall not live by bread alone

 \u201cAgain it is written
 \u2018You shall not tempt the Lord your God.\u2019\u201d ","Then Jesus said to him
 \u201cBegone
 Satan! for it is written
 \u2018You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.\u2019\u201d","From that time Jesus began to preach
 saying
 \u201cRepent

 \u201cFollow me

 for they shall be satisfied.","\u201cBlessed are the merciful
 for they shall obtain mercy.","\u201cBlessed are the pure in heart
 for they shall see God.","\u201cBlessed are the peacemakers

 for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.","\u201cBlessed are you when men revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account.","Rejoice and be glad
 for your reward is great in heaven
 for so men persecuted the prophets who were before you.","\u201cYou are the salt of the earth; but if salt has lost its taste
 how shall its saltness be restored? It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trodden under foot by men.","\u201cYou are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hid.","Nor do men light a lamp and put it under a bushel
 but on a stand
 and it gives light to all in the house. ","Let your light so shine before men
 that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.","\u201cThink not that I have come to abolish the law and the prophets; I have come not to abolish them but to fulfil them.","For truly
 I say to you
 till heaven and earth pass away
 not an iota
 not a dot
 will pass from the law until all is accomplished. ","Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches men so
 shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. ","For I tell you
 unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees
 you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.","\u201cYou have heard that it was said to the men of old
 \u2018You shall not kill; and whoever kills shall be liable to judgment.\u2019 ","But I say to you that every one who is angry with his brother shall be liable to judgment; whoever insults his brother shall be liable to the council
 and whoever says
 \u2018You fool!\u2019 shall be liable to the hell of fire. ","So if you are offering your gift at the altar
 and there remember that your brother has something against you
 ","leave your gift there before the altar and go; first be reconciled to your brother
 and then come and offer your gift. ","Make friends quickly with your accuser
 while you are going with him to court
 lest your accuser hand you over to the judge
 and the judge to the guard
 and you be put in prison; ","truly
 I say to you
 you will never get out till you have paid the last penny.","\u201cYou have heard that it was said
 \u2018You shall not commit adultery.\u2019 ","But I say to you that every one who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.","If your right eye causes you to sin
 pluck it out and throw it away; it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body be thrown into hell. ","And if your right hand causes you to sin
 cut it off and throw it away; it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body go into hell.","\u201cIt was also said
 \u2018Whoever divorces his wife
 let him give her a certificate of divorce.\u2019 ","But I say to you that every one who divorces his wife
 except on the ground of unchastity
 makes her an adulteress; and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.","\u201cAgain you have heard that it was said to the men of old
 \u2018You shall not swear falsely
 but shall perform to the Lord what you have sworn.\u2019 ","But I say to you
 Do not swear at all
 either by heaven
 for it is the throne of God
 ","or by the earth

 for you cannot make one hair white or black. ","Let what you say be simply \u2018Yes\u2019 or \u2018No\u2019; anything more than this comes from evil.","\u201cYou have heard that it was said
 \u2018An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.\u2019 ","But I say to you
 Do not resist one who is evil. But if any one strikes you on the right cheek
 turn to him the other also; ","and if any one would sue you and take your coat
 let him have your cloak as well; ","and if any one forces you to go one mile
 go with him two miles. ","Give to him who begs from you
 and do not refuse him who would borrow from you.","\u201cYou have heard that it was said
 \u2018You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.\u2019 ","But I say to you
 Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you
 ","so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven; for he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good
 and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. ","For if you love those who love you
 what reward have you? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? ","And if you salute only your brethren
 what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same? ","You
 therefore
 must be perfect
 as your heavenly Father is perfect.","\u201cBeware of practicing your piety before men in order to be seen by them; for then you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven.","\u201cThus
 when you give alms
 sound no trumpet before you
 as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets
 that they may be praised by men. Truly
 I say to you
 they have their reward. ","But when you give alms
 do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing
 ","so that your alms may be in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.","\u201cAnd when you pray
 you must not be like the hypocrites; for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners
 that they may be seen by men. Truly
 I say to you
 they have their reward. ","But when you pray
 go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.","\u201cAnd in praying do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do; for they think that they will be heard for their many words.","Do not be like them
 for your Father knows what you need before you ask him. ","Pray then like this: Our Father who art in heaven
 Hallowed be thy name.","Thy kingdom come
 Thy will be done
 On earth as it is in heaven.","Give us this day our daily bread;","And forgive us our debts
 As we also have forgiven our debtors;","And lead us not into temptation
 But deliver us from evil.","For if you forgive men their trespasses
 your heavenly Father also will forgive you; ","but if you do not forgive men their trespasses
 neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.","\u201cAnd when you fast
 do not look dismal
 like the hypocrites
 for they disfigure their faces that their fasting may be seen by men. Truly
 I say to you
 they have their reward. ","But when you fast
 anoint your head and wash your face
 ","that your fasting may not be seen by men but by your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.","\u201cDo not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth
 where moth and rust consume and where thieves break in and steal
 ","but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven
 where neither moth nor rust consumes and where thieves do not break in and steal. ","For where your treasure is
 there will your heart be also.","\u201cThe eye is the lamp of the body. So
 if your eye is sound
 your whole body will be full of light; ","but if your eye is not sound
 your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light in you is darkness
 how great is the darkness!","\u201cNo one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other
 or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.","\u201cTherefore I tell you
 do not be anxious about your life
 what you shall eat or what you shall drink
 nor about your body
 what you shall put on. Is not life more than food
 and the body more than clothing? ","Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns
 and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? ","And which of you by being anxious can add one cubit to his span of life?","And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field
 how they grow; they neither toil nor spin; ","yet I tell you
 even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. ","But if God so clothes the grass of the field
 which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven
 will he not much more clothe you
 O men of little faith? ","Therefore do not be anxious
 saying
 \u2018What shall we eat?\u2019 or \u2018What shall we drink?\u2019 or \u2018What shall we wear?\u2019 ","For the Gentiles seek all these things; and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all.","But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness
 and all these things shall be yours as well.","\u201cTherefore do not be anxious about tomorrow
 for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Let the day\u2019s own trouble be sufficient for the day.","\u201cJudge not
 that you be not judged. ","For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged
 and the measure you give will be the measure you get. ","Why do you see the speck that is in your brother\u2019s eye
 but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? ","Or how can you say to your brother
 \u2018Let me take the speck out of your eye
\u2019 when there is the log in your own eye? ","You hypocrite
 first take the log out of your own eye
 and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother\u2019s eye.","\u201cDo not give dogs what is holy; and do not throw your pearls before swine
 lest they trample them under foot and turn to attack you.","\u201cAsk
 and it will be given you; seek
 and you will find; knock
 and it will be opened to you. ","For every one who asks receives
 and he who seeks finds
 and to him who knocks it will be opened. ","Or what man of you
 if his son asks him for bread
 will give him a stone? ","Or if he asks for a fish
 will give him a serpent? ","If you then
 who are evil
 know how to give good gifts to your children
 how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him! ","So whatever you wish that men would do to you
 do so to them; for this is the law and the prophets.","\u201cEnter by the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is easy
 that leads to destruction
 and those who enter by it are many. ","For the gate is narrow and the way is hard
 that leads to life
 and those who find it are few.","\u201cBeware of false prophets
 who come to you in sheep\u2019s clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves. ","You will know them by their fruits. Are grapes gathered from thorns
 or figs from thistles? ","So
 every sound tree bears good fruit
 but the bad tree bears evil fruit. ","A sound tree cannot bear evil fruit
 nor can a bad tree bear good fruit. ","Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.","Thus you will know them by their fruits.","\u201cNot every one who says to me
 \u2018Lord
 Lord

 but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. ","On that day many will say to me
 \u2018Lord
 Lord

 \u2018I never knew you; depart from me

 many will come from east and west and sit at table with Abraham
 Isaac

 \u201cWhy are you afraid

 they brought to him a paralytic
 lying on his bed; and when Jesus saw their faith he said to the paralytic

 knowing their thoughts
 said
 \u201cWhy do you think evil in your hearts? ","For which is easier
 to say
 \u2018Your sins are forgiven
\u2019 or to say
 \u2018Rise and walk\u2019? ","But that you may know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins\u201d\u2014he then said to the paralytic\u2014\u201cRise

 he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax office; and he said to him

 daughter; your faith has made you well.\u201d And instantly the woman was made well. ","he said
 \u201cDepart; for the girl is not dead but sleeping.\u201d And they laughed at him. ","When he entered the house
 the blind men came to him; and Jesus said to them
 \u201cDo you believe that I am able to do this?\u201d They said to him
 \u201cYes
 Lord.\u201d ","And their eyes were opened. And Jesus sternly charged them
 \u201cSee that no one knows it.\u201d ","Then he said to his disciples
 \u201cThe harvest is plentiful
 but the laborers are few; ","pray therefore the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest.\u201d","These twelve Jesus sent out
 charging them
 \u201cGo nowhere among the Gentiles
 and enter no town of the Samaritans
 ","but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.","And preach as you go
 saying
 \u2018The kingdom of heaven is at hand.\u2019 ","Heal the sick
 raise the dead
 cleanse lepers
 cast out demons. You received without pay
 give without pay. ","Take no gold
 nor silver
 nor copper in your belts
 ","no bag for your journey
 nor two tunics
 nor sandals
 nor a staff; for the laborer deserves his food. ","And whatever town or village you enter
 find out who is worthy in it
 and stay with him until you depart. ","As you enter the house
 salute it. ","And if the house is worthy
 let your peace come upon it; but if it is not worthy
 let your peace return to you. ","And if any one will not receive you or listen to your words
 shake off the dust from your feet as you leave that house or town. ","Truly
 I say to you
 it shall be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom and Gomor\u2032rah than for that town.","\u201cBehold
 I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves; so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves. ","Beware of men; for they will deliver you up to councils
 and flog you in their synagogues
 ","and you will be dragged before governors and kings for my sake
 to bear testimony before them and the Gentiles. ","When they deliver you up
 do not be anxious how you are to speak or what you are to say; for what you are to say will be given to you in that hour; ","for it is not you who speak
 but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you. ","Brother will deliver up brother to death
 and the father his child
 and children will rise against parents and have them put to death; ","and you will be hated by all for my name\u2019s sake. But he who endures to the end will be saved.","When they persecute you in one town
 flee to the next; for truly
 I say to you
 you will not have gone through all the towns of Israel
 before the Son of man comes.","\u201cA disciple is not above his teacher
 nor a servant above his master; ","it is enough for the disciple to be like his teacher
 and the servant like his master. If they have called the master of the house Be-el\u2032zebul
 how much more will they malign those of his household.","\u201cSo have no fear of them; for nothing is covered that will not be revealed
 or hidden that will not be known. ","What I tell you in the dark
 utter in the light; and what you hear whispered
 proclaim upon the housetops. ","And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.","Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them will fall to the ground without your Father\u2019s will.","But even the hairs of your head are all numbered.","Fear not
 therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows. ","So every one who acknowledges me before men
 I also will acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven; ","but whoever denies me before men
 I also will deny before my Father who is in heaven.","\u201cDo not think that I have come to bring peace on earth; I have not come to bring peace
 but a sword. ","For I have come to set a man against his father
 and a daughter against her mother
 and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; ","and a man\u2019s foes will be those of his own household.","He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me;","and he who does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me.","He who finds his life will lose it
 and he who loses his life for my sake will find it.","\u201cHe who receives you receives me
 and he who receives me receives him who sent me. ","He who receives a prophet because he is a prophet shall receive a prophet\u2019s reward
 and he who receives a righteous man because he is a righteous man shall receive a righteous man\u2019s reward. ","And whoever gives to one of these little ones even a cup of cold water because he is a disciple
 truly
 I say to you
 he shall not lose his reward.\u201d","And Jesus answered them
 \u201cGo and tell John what you hear and see: ","the blind receive their sight and the lame walk
 lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear
 and the dead are raised up
 and the poor have good news preached to them. ","And blessed is he who takes no offense at me.\u201d","As they went away
 Jesus began to speak to the crowds concerning John: \u201cWhat did you go out into the wilderness to behold? A reed shaken by the wind? ","Why then did you go out? To see a man clothed in soft raiment? Behold
 those who wear soft raiment are in kings\u2019 houses. ","Why then did you go out? To see a prophet? Yes
 I tell you
 and more than a prophet. ","This is he of whom it is written
 \u2018Behold
 I send my messenger before thy face
 who shall prepare thy way before thee.\u2019","Truly
 I say to you
 among those born of women there has risen no one greater than John the Baptist; yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. ","From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has suffered violence
 and men of violence take it by force. ","For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John;","and if you are willing to accept it
 he is Eli\u2032jah who is to come. ","He who has ears to hear
 let him hear.","\u201cBut to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the market places and calling to their playmates
","\u2018We piped to you
 and you did not dance; we wailed
 and you did not mourn.\u2019","For John came neither eating nor drinking
 and they say
 \u2018He has a demon\u2019; ","the Son of man came eating and drinking
 and they say
 \u2018Behold
 a glutton and a drunkard
 a friend of tax collectors and sinners!\u2019 Yet wisdom is justified by her deeds.\u201d","Then he began to upbraid the cities where most of his mighty works had been done
 because they did not repent. ","\u201cWoe to you
 Chora\u2032zin! woe to you
 Beth-sa\u2032ida! for if the mighty works done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon
 they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. ","But I tell you
 it shall be more tolerable on the day of judgment for Tyre and Sidon than for you. ","And you
 Caper\u2032na-um
 will you be exalted to heaven? You shall be brought down to Hades. For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Sodom
 it would have remained until this day. ","But I tell you that it shall be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom than for you.\u201d","At that time Jesus declared
 \u201cI thank thee
 Father
 Lord of heaven and earth
 that thou hast hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to babes; ","yea
 Father
 for such was thy gracious will. ","All things have been delivered to me by my Father; and no one knows the Son except the Father
 and no one knows the Father except the Son and any one to whom the Son chooses to reveal him. ","Come to me
 all who labor and are heavy laden
 and I will give you rest. ","Take my yoke upon you
 and learn from me; for I am gentle and lowly in heart
 and you will find rest for your souls. ","For my yoke is easy
 and my burden is light.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cHave you not read what David did
 when he was hungry
 and those who were with him: ","how he entered the house of God and ate the bread of the Presence
 which it was not lawful for him to eat nor for those who were with him
 but only for the priests? ","Or have you not read in the law how on the sabbath the priests in the temple profane the sabbath
 and are guiltless? ","I tell you
 something greater than the temple is here. ","And if you had known what this means
 \u2018I desire mercy
 and not sacrifice
\u2019 you would not have condemned the guiltless. ","For the Son of man is lord of the sabbath.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cWhat man of you
 if he has one sheep and it falls into a pit on the sabbath
 will not lay hold of it and lift it out? ","Of how much more value is a man than a sheep! So it is lawful to do good on the sabbath.\u201d","Then he said to the man
 \u201cStretch out your hand.\u201d And the man stretched it out
 and it was restored
 whole like the other. ","Knowing their thoughts
 he said to them
 \u201cEvery kingdom divided against itself is laid waste
 and no city or house divided against itself will stand; ","and if Satan casts out Satan
 he is divided against himself; how then will his kingdom stand? ","And if I cast out demons by Be-el\u2032zebul
 by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges. ","But if it is by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons
 then the kingdom of God has come upon you. ","Or how can one enter a strong man\u2019s house and plunder his goods
 unless he first binds the strong man? Then indeed he may plunder his house. ","He who is not with me is against me
 and he who does not gather with me scatters. ","Therefore I tell you
 every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men
 but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. ","And whoever says a word against the Son of man will be forgiven; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven
 either in this age or in the age to come.","\u201cEither make the tree good
 and its fruit good; or make the tree bad
 and its fruit bad; for the tree is known by its fruit. ","You brood of vipers! how can you speak good
 when you are evil? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. ","The good man out of his good treasure brings forth good
 and the evil man out of his evil treasure brings forth evil. ","I tell you
 on the day of judgment men will render account for every careless word they utter; ","for by your words you will be justified
 and by your words you will be condemned.\u201d","But he answered them
 \u201cAn evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign; but no sign shall be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. ","For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale
 so will the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. ","The men of Nin\u2032eveh will arise at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah
 and behold
 something greater than Jonah is here. ","The queen of the South will arise at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon
 and behold
 something greater than Solomon is here.","\u201cWhen the unclean spirit has gone out of a man
 he passes through waterless places seeking rest
 but he finds none. ","Then he says
 \u2018I will return to my house from which I came.\u2019 And when he comes he finds it empty
 swept
 and put in order. ","Then he goes and brings with him seven other spirits more evil than himself
 and they enter and dwell there; and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first. So shall it be also with this evil generation.\u201d","While he was still speaking to the people
 behold
 his mother and his brethren stood outside
 asking to speak to him. ","But he replied to the man who told him
 \u201cWho is my mother
 and who are my brethren?\u201d ","And stretching out his hand toward his disciples
 he said
 \u201cHere are my mother and my brethren! ","For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother
 and sister
 and mother.\u201d","And he told them many things in parables
 saying: \u201cA sower went out to sow. ","And as he sowed
 some seeds fell along the path
 and the birds came and devoured them. ","Other seeds fell on rocky ground
 where they had not much soil
 and immediately they sprang up
 since they had no depth of soil
 ","but when the sun rose they were scorched; and since they had no root they withered away.","Other seeds fell upon thorns
 and the thorns grew up and choked them. ","Other seeds fell on good soil and brought forth grain
 some a hundredfold
 some sixty
 some thirty. ","He who has ears
 let him hear.\u201d","And he answered them
 \u201cTo you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven
 but to them it has not been given. ","For to him who has will more be given
 and he will have abundance; but from him who has not
 even what he has will be taken away. ","This is why I speak to them in parables
 because seeing they do not see
 and hearing they do not hear
 nor do they understand. ","With them indeed is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says: \u2018You shall indeed hear but never understand
 and you shall indeed see but never perceive.","For this people\u2019s heart has grown dull
 and their ears are heavy of hearing
 and their eyes they have closed
 lest they should perceive with their eyes
 and hear with their ears
 and understand with their heart
 and turn for me to heal them.\u2019","But blessed are your eyes
 for they see
 and your ears
 for they hear. ","Truly
 I say to you
 many prophets and righteous men longed to see what you see
 and did not see it
 and to hear what you hear
 and did not hear it.","\u201cHear then the parable of the sower.","When any one hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it
 the evil one comes and snatches away what is sown in his heart; this is what was sown along the path. ","As for what was sown on rocky ground
 this is he who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy; ","yet he has no root in himself
 but endures for a while
 and when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word
 immediately he falls away. ","As for what was sown among thorns
 this is he who hears the word
 but the cares of the world and the delight in riches choke the word
 and it proves unfruitful. ","As for what was sown on good soil
 this is he who hears the word and understands it; he indeed bears fruit
 and yields
 in one case a hundredfold
 in another sixty
 and in another thirty.\u201d","Another parable he put before them
 saying
 \u201cThe kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field; ","but while men were sleeping
 his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat
 and went away. ","So when the plants came up and bore grain
 then the weeds appeared also. ","And the servants of the householder came and said to him
 \u2018Sir
 did you not sow good seed in your field? How then has it weeds?\u2019 ","He said to them
 \u2018An enemy has done this.\u2019 The servants said to him
 \u2018Then do you want us to go and gather them?\u2019 ","But he said
 \u2018No; lest in gathering the weeds you root up the wheat along with them. ","Let both grow together until the harvest; and at harvest time I will tell the reapers
 Gather the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned
 but gather the wheat into my barn.\u2019\u201d","Another parable he put before them
 saying
 \u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his field; ","it is the smallest of all seeds
 but when it has grown it is the greatest of shrubs and becomes a tree
 so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches.\u201d","He told them another parable. \u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal
 till it was all leavened.\u201d","He answered
 \u201cHe who sows the good seed is the Son of man; ","the field is the world
 and the good seed means the sons of the kingdom; the weeds are the sons of the evil one
 ","and the enemy who sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the close of the age
 and the reapers are angels. ","Just as the weeds are gathered and burned with fire
 so will it be at the close of the age. ","The Son of man will send his angels
 and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all evildoers
 ","and throw them into the furnace of fire; there men will weep and gnash their teeth.","Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears
 let him hear.","\u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field
 which a man found and covered up; then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.","\u201cAgain
 the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls
 ","who
 on finding one pearl of great value
 went and sold all that he had and bought it.","\u201cAgain
 the kingdom of heaven is like a net which was thrown into the sea and gathered fish of every kind; ","when it was full
 men drew it ashore and sat down and sorted the good into vessels but threw away the bad. ","So it will be at the close of the age. The angels will come out and separate the evil from the righteous
 ","and throw them into the furnace of fire; there men will weep and gnash their teeth.","\u201cHave you understood all this?\u201d They said to him
 \u201cYes.\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cTherefore every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old.\u201d","And they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them
 \u201cA prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own house.\u201d ","Jesus said
 \u201cThey need not go away; you give them something to eat.\u201d ","And he said
 \u201cBring them here to me.\u201d ","But immediately he spoke to them
 saying
 \u201cTake heart
 it is I; have no fear.\u201d","He said
 \u201cCome.\u201d So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water and came to Jesus; ","Jesus immediately reached out his hand and caught him
 saying to him
 \u201cO man of little faith
 why did you doubt?\u201d ","He answered them
 \u201cAnd why do you transgress the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition? ","For God commanded
 \u2018Honor your father and your mother
\u2019 and
 \u2018He who speaks evil of father or mother
 let him surely die.\u2019 ","But you say
 \u2018If any one tells his father or his mother
 What you would have gained from me is given to God
 he need not honor his father.\u2019 ","So
 for the sake of your tradition
 you have made void the word of God. ","You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you
 when he said:","\u2018This people honors me with their lips
 but their heart is far from me;","in vain do they worship me
 teaching as doctrines the precepts of men.\u2019\u201d","And he called the people to him and said to them
 \u201cHear and understand: ","not what goes into the mouth defiles a man
 but what comes out of the mouth
 this defiles a man.\u201d ","He answered
 \u201cEvery plant which my heavenly Father has not planted will be rooted up. ","Let them alone; they are blind guides. And if a blind man leads a blind man
 both will fall into a pit.\u201d ","And he said
 \u201cAre you also still without understanding? ","Do you not see that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the stomach
 and so passes on? ","But what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart
 and this defiles a man. ","For out of the heart come evil thoughts
 murder
 adultery
 fornication
 theft
 false witness
 slander. ","These are what defile a man; but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a man.\u201d","He answered
 \u201cI was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\u201d ","And he answered
 \u201cIt is not fair to take the children\u2019s bread and throw it to the dogs.\u201d ","Then Jesus answered her
 \u201cO woman
 great is your faith! Be it done for you as you desire.\u201d And her daughter was healed instantly.","Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said
 \u201cI have compassion on the crowd
 because they have been with me now three days
 and have nothing to eat; and I am unwilling to send them away hungry
 lest they faint on the way.\u201d ","And Jesus said to them
 \u201cHow many loaves have you?\u201d They said
 \u201cSeven
 and a few small fish.\u201d ","He answered them
 \u201cWhen it is evening
 you say
 \u2018It will be fair weather; for the sky is red.\u2019 ","And in the morning
 \u2018It will be stormy today
 for the sky is red and threatening.\u2019 You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky
 but you cannot interpret the signs of the times. ","An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign
 but no sign shall be given to it except the sign of Jonah.\u201d So he left them and departed.","Jesus said to them
 \u201cTake heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sad\u2032ducees.\u201d ","But Jesus
 aware of this
 said
 \u201cO men of little faith
 why do you discuss among yourselves the fact that you have no bread? ","Do you not yet perceive? Do you not remember the five loaves of the five thousand
 and how many baskets you gathered? ","Or the seven loaves of the four thousand
 and how many baskets you gathered? ","How is it that you fail to perceive that I did not speak about bread? Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sad\u2032ducees.\u201d","Now when Jesus came into the district of Caesare\u2032a Philippi
 he asked his disciples
 \u201cWho do men say that the Son of man is?\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cBut who do you say that I am?\u201d ","And Jesus answered him
 \u201cBlessed are you
 Simon Bar-Jona! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you
 but my Father who is in heaven. ","And I tell you
 you are Peter
 and on this rock I will build my church
 and the powers of death shall not prevail against it. ","I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven
 and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven
 and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\u201d ","But he turned and said to Peter
 \u201cGet behind me
 Satan! You are a hindrance to me; for you are not on the side of God
 but of men.\u201d","Then Jesus told his disciples
 \u201cIf any man would come after me
 let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. ","For whoever would save his life will lose it
 and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it. ","For what will it profit a man
 if he gains the whole world and forfeits his life? Or what shall a man give in return for his life? ","For the Son of man is to come with his angels in the glory of his Father
 and then he will repay every man for what he has done. ","Truly
 I say to you
 there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.\u201d","But Jesus came and touched them
 saying
 \u201cRise
 and have no fear.\u201d ","And as they were coming down the mountain
 Jesus commanded them
 \u201cTell no one the vision
 until the Son of man is raised from the dead.\u201d ","He replied
 \u201cEli\u2032jah does come
 and he is to restore all things; ","but I tell you that Eli\u2032jah has already come
 and they did not know him
 but did to him whatever they pleased. So also the Son of man will suffer at their hands.\u201d ","And Jesus answered
 \u201cO faithless and perverse generation
 how long am I to be with you? How long am I to bear with you? Bring him here to me.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cBecause of your little faith. For truly
 I say to you
 if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed
 you will say to this mountain
 \u2018Move from hence to yonder place
\u2019 and it will move; and nothing will be impossible to you.\u201d","As they were gathering in Galilee
 Jesus said to them
 \u201cThe Son of man is to be delivered into the hands of men
 ","and they will kill him
 and he will be raised on the third day.\u201d And they were greatly distressed.","He said
 \u201cYes.\u201d And when he came home
 Jesus spoke to him first
 saying
 \u201cWhat do you think
 Simon? From whom do kings of the earth take toll or tribute? From their sons or from others?\u201d ","And when he said
 \u201cFrom others
\u201d Jesus said to him
 \u201cThen the sons are free. ","However
 not to give offense to them
 go to the sea and cast a hook
 and take the first fish that comes up
 and when you open its mouth you will find a shekel; take that and give it to them for me and for yourself.\u201d","and said
 \u201cTruly
 I say to you
 unless you turn and become like children
 you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. ","Whoever humbles himself like this child
 he is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.","\u201cWhoever receives one such child in my name receives me;","but whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin
 it would be better for him to have a great millstone fastened round his neck and to be drowned in the depth of the sea.","\u201cWoe to the world for temptations to sin! For it is necessary that temptations come
 but woe to the man by whom the temptation comes! ","And if your hand or your foot causes you to sin
 cut it off and throw it from you; it is better for you to enter life maimed or lame than with two hands or two feet to be thrown into the eternal fire. ","And if your eye causes you to sin
 pluck it out and throw it from you; it is better for you to enter life with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into the hell of fire.","\u201cSee that you do not despise one of these little ones; for I tell you that in heaven their angels always behold the face of my Father who is in heaven.","What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep
 and one of them has gone astray
 does he not leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go in search of the one that went astray? ","And if he finds it
 truly
 I say to you
 he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that never went astray. ","So it is not the will of my Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.","\u201cIf your brother sins against you
 go and tell him his fault
 between you and him alone. If he listens to you
 you have gained your brother. ","But if he does not listen
 take one or two others along with you
 that every word may be confirmed by the evidence of two or three witnesses. ","If he refuses to listen to them
 tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church
 let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector. ","Truly
 I say to you
 whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven
 and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. ","Again I say to you
 if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask
 it will be done for them by my Father in heaven. ","For where two or three are gathered in my name
 there am I in the midst of them.\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cI do not say to you seven times
 but seventy times seven.","\u201cTherefore the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his servants.","When he began the reckoning
 one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents; ","and as he could not pay
 his lord ordered him to be sold
 with his wife and children and all that he had
 and payment to be made. ","So the servant fell on his knees
 imploring him
 \u2018Lord
 have patience with me
 and I will pay you everything.\u2019 ","And out of pity for him the lord of that servant released him and forgave him the debt.","But that same servant
 as he went out
 came upon one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii; and seizing him by the throat he said
 \u2018Pay what you owe.\u2019 ","So his fellow servant fell down and besought him
 \u2018Have patience with me
 and I will pay you.\u2019 ","He refused and went and put him in prison till he should pay the debt.","When his fellow servants saw what had taken place
 they were greatly distressed
 and they went and reported to their lord all that had taken place. ","Then his lord summoned him and said to him
 \u2018You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you besought me; ","and should not you have had mercy on your fellow servant
 as I had mercy on you?\u2019 ","And in anger his lord delivered him to the jailers
 till he should pay all his debt. ","So also my heavenly Father will do to every one of you
 if you do not forgive your brother from your heart.\u201d","He answered
 \u201cHave you not read that he who made them from the beginning made them male and female
 ","and said
 \u2018For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife
 and the two shall become one\u2019? ","So they are no longer two but one. What therefore God has joined together
 let not man put asunder.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cFor your hardness of heart Moses allowed you to divorce your wives
 but from the beginning it was not so. ","And I say to you: whoever divorces his wife
 except for unchastity
 and marries another
 commits adultery; and he who marries a divorced woman
 commits adultery.\u201d","But he said to them
 \u201cNot all men can receive this precept
 but only those to whom it is given. ","For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth
 and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men
 and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. He who is able to receive this
 let him receive it.\u201d","but Jesus said
 \u201cLet the children come to me
 and do not hinder them; for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven.\u201d ","And he said to him
 \u201cWhy do you ask me about what is good? One there is who is good. If you would enter life
 keep the commandments.\u201d ","He said to him
 \u201cWhich?\u201d And Jesus said
 \u201cYou shall not kill
 You shall not commit adultery
 You shall not steal
 You shall not bear false witness
 ","Honor your father and mother
 and
 You shall love your neighbor as yourself.\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cIf you would be perfect
 go
 sell what you possess and give to the poor
 and you will have treasure in heaven; and come
 follow me.\u201d ","And Jesus said to his disciples
 \u201cTruly
 I say to you
 it will be hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. ","Again I tell you
 it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.\u201d ","But Jesus looked at them and said to them
 \u201cWith men this is impossible
 but with God all things are possible.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cTruly
 I say to you
 in the new world
 when the Son of man shall sit on his glorious throne
 you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones
 judging the twelve tribes of Israel. ","And every one who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands
 for my name\u2019s sake
 will receive a hundredfold
 and inherit eternal life. ","But many that are first will be last
 and the last first.","\u201cFor the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.","After agreeing with the laborers for a denarius a day
 he sent them into his vineyard. ","And going out about the third hour he saw others standing idle in the market place;","and to them he said
 \u2018You go into the vineyard too
 and whatever is right I will give you.\u2019 So they went. ","Going out again about the sixth hour and the ninth hour
 he did the same. ","And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing; and he said to them
 \u2018Why do you stand here idle all day?\u2019 ","They said to him
 \u2018Because no one has hired us.\u2019 He said to them
 \u2018You go into the vineyard too.\u2019 ","And when evening came
 the owner of the vineyard said to his steward
 \u2018Call the laborers and pay them their wages
 beginning with the last
 up to the first.\u2019 ","And when those hired about the eleventh hour came
 each of them received a denarius. ","Now when the first came
 they thought they would receive more; but each of them also received a denarius. ","And on receiving it they grumbled at the householder
 ","saying
 \u2018These last worked only one hour
 and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat.\u2019 ","But he replied to one of them
 \u2018Friend
 I am doing you no wrong; did you not agree with me for a denarius? ","Take what belongs to you
 and go; I choose to give to this last as I give to you. ","Am I not allowed to do what I choose with what belongs to me? Or do you begrudge my generosity?\u2019","So the last will be first
 and the first last.\u201d","\u201cBehold
 we are going up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes
 and they will condemn him to death
 ","and deliver him to the Gentiles to be mocked and scourged and crucified
 and he will be raised on the third day.\u201d","And he said to her
 \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d She said to him
 \u201cCommand that these two sons of mine may sit
 one at your right hand and one at your left
 in your kingdom.\u201d ","But Jesus answered
 \u201cYou do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am to drink?\u201d They said to him
 \u201cWe are able.\u201d ","But Jesus called them to him and said
 \u201cYou know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them
 and their great men exercise authority over them. ","It shall not be so among you; but whoever would be great among you must be your servant
 ","and whoever would be first among you must be your slave;","even as the Son of man came not to be served but to serve
 and to give his life as a ransom for many.\u201d","And Jesus stopped and called them
 saying
 \u201cWhat do you want me to do for you?\u201d ","saying to them
 \u201cGo into the village opposite you
 and immediately you will find an ass tied
 and a colt with her; untie them and bring them to me. ","If any one says anything to you
 you shall say
 \u2018The Lord has need of them
\u2019 and he will send them immediately.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cIt is written
 \u2018My house shall be called a house of prayer\u2019; but you make it a den of robbers.\u201d","and they said to him
 \u201cDo you hear what these are saying?\u201d And Jesus said to them
 \u201cYes; have you never read
 \u2018Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast brought perfect praise\u2019?\u201d","And seeing a fig tree by the wayside he went to it
 and found nothing on it but leaves only. And he said to it
 \u201cMay no fruit ever come from you again!\u201d And the fig tree withered at once. ","And Jesus answered them
 \u201cTruly
 I say to you
 if you have faith and never doubt
 you will not only do what has been done to the fig tree
 but even if you say to this mountain
 \u2018Be taken up and cast into the sea
\u2019 it will be done. ","And whatever you ask in prayer
 you will receive
 if you have faith.\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cI also will ask you a question; and if you tell me the answer
 then I also will tell you by what authority I do these things. ","The baptism of John
 whence was it? From heaven or from men?\u201d And they argued with one another
 \u201cIf we say
 \u2018From heaven
\u2019 he will say to us
 \u2018Why then did you not believe him?\u2019 ","So they answered Jesus
 \u201cWe do not know.\u201d And he said to them
 \u201cNeither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.","\u201cWhat do you think? A man had two sons; and he went to the first and said
 \u2018Son
 go and work in the vineyard today.\u2019 ","And he answered
 \u2018I will not\u2019; but afterward he repented and went. ","And he went to the second and said the same; and he answered
 \u2018I go
 sir
\u2019 but did not go. ","Which of the two did the will of his father?\u201d They said
 \u201cThe first.\u201d Jesus said to them
 \u201cTruly
 I say to you
 the tax collectors and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you. ","For John came to you in the way of righteousness
 and you did not believe him
 but the tax collectors and the harlots believed him; and even when you saw it
 you did not afterward repent and believe him.","\u201cHear another parable. There was a householder who planted a vineyard
 and set a hedge around it
 and dug a wine press in it
 and built a tower
 and let it out to tenants
 and went into another country. ","When the season of fruit drew near
 he sent his servants to the tenants
 to get his fruit; ","and the tenants took his servants and beat one
 killed another
 and stoned another. ","Again he sent other servants
 more than the first; and they did the same to them. ","Afterward he sent his son to them
 saying
 \u2018They will respect my son.\u2019 ","But when the tenants saw the son
 they said to themselves
 \u2018This is the heir; come
 let us kill him and have his inheritance.\u2019 ","And they took him and cast him out of the vineyard
 and killed him. ","When therefore the owner of the vineyard comes
 what will he do to those tenants?\u201d ","They said to him
 \u201cHe will put those wretches to a miserable death
 and let out the vineyard to other tenants who will give him the fruits in their seasons.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cHave you never read in the scriptures: \u2018The very stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner; this was the Lord\u2019s doing
 and it is marvelous in our eyes\u2019?","Therefore I tell you
 the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a nation producing the fruits of it. ","And he who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; but when it falls on any one
 it will crush him.\u201d","\u201cThe kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who gave a marriage feast for his son
 ","and sent his servants to call those who were invited to the marriage feast; but they would not come.","Again he sent other servants
 saying
 \u2018Tell those who are invited
 Behold
 I have made ready my dinner
 my oxen and my fat calves are killed
 and everything is ready; come to the marriage feast.\u2019 ","But they made light of it and went off
 one to his farm
 another to his business
 ","while the rest seized his servants
 treated them shamefully
 and killed them. ","The king was angry
 and he sent his troops and destroyed those murderers and burned their city. ","Then he said to his servants
 \u2018The wedding is ready
 but those invited were not worthy. ","Go therefore to the thoroughfares
 and invite to the marriage feast as many as you find.\u2019 ","And those servants went out into the streets and gathered all whom they found
 both bad and good; so the wedding hall was filled with guests.","\u201cBut when the king came in to look at the guests
 he saw there a man who had no wedding garment; ","and he said to him
 \u2018Friend
 how did you get in here without a wedding garment?\u2019 And he was speechless. ","Then the king said to the attendants
 \u2018Bind him hand and foot
 and cast him into the outer darkness; there men will weep and gnash their teeth.\u2019 ","For many are called
 but few are chosen.\u201d","But Jesus
 aware of their malice
 said
 \u201cWhy put me to the test
 you hypocrites? ","Show me the money for the tax.\u201d And they brought him a coin.","And Jesus said to them
 \u201cWhose likeness and inscription is this?\u201d ","They said
 \u201cCaesar\u2019s.\u201d Then he said to them
 \u201cRender therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar\u2019s
 and to God the things that are God\u2019s.\u201d ","But Jesus answered them
 \u201cYou are wrong
 because you know neither the scriptures nor the power of God. ","For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage
 but are like angels in heaven. ","And as for the resurrection of the dead
 have you not read what was said to you by God
 ","\u2018I am the God of Abraham
 and the God of Isaac
 and the God of Jacob\u2019? He is not God of the dead
 but of the living.\u201d ","And he said to him
 \u201cYou shall love the Lord your God with all your heart
 and with all your soul
 and with all your mind. ","This is the great and first commandment.","And a second is like it
 You shall love your neighbor as yourself. ","On these two commandments depend all the law and the prophets.\u201d","saying
 \u201cWhat do you think of the Christ? Whose son is he?\u201d They said to him
 \u201cThe son of David.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cHow is it then that David
 inspired by the Spirit
 calls him Lord

","\u2018The Lord said to my Lord
 Sit at my right hand
 till I put thy enemies under thy feet\u2019?","If David thus calls him Lord
 how is he his son?\u201d ","\u201cThe scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses\u2019 seat;","so practice and observe whatever they tell you
 but not what they do; for they preach
 but do not practice. ","They bind heavy burdens
 hard to bear
 and lay them on men\u2019s shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with their finger. ","They do all their deeds to be seen by men; for they make their phylacteries broad and their fringes long
 ","and they love the place of honor at feasts and the best seats in the synagogues
 ","and salutations in the market places
 and being called rabbi by men. ","But you are not to be called rabbi
 for you have one teacher
 and you are all brethren. ","And call no man your father on earth

 who is in heaven. ","Neither be called masters

 the Christ. ","He who is greatest among you shall be your servant;","whoever exalts himself will be humbled
 and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.","\u201cBut woe to you
 scribes and Pharisees
 hypocrites! because you shut the kingdom of heaven against men; for you neither enter yourselves
 nor allow those who would enter to go in. ","Woe to you
 scribes and Pharisees
 hypocrites! for you traverse sea and land to make a single proselyte

 you make him twice as much a child of hell as yourselves.","\u201cWoe to you
 blind guides
 who say
 \u2018If any one swears by the temple
 it is nothing; but if any one swears by the gold of the temple
 he is bound by his oath.\u2019 ","You blind fools! For which is greater
 the gold or the temple that has made the gold sacred? ","And you say
 \u2018If any one swears by the altar
 it is nothing; but if any one swears by the gift that is on the altar
 he is bound by his oath.\u2019 ","You blind men! For which is greater
 the gift or the altar that makes the gift sacred? ","So he who swears by the altar
 swears by it and by everything on it; ","and he who swears by the temple
 swears by it and by him who dwells in it; ","and he who swears by heaven
 swears by the throne of God and by him who sits upon it.","\u201cWoe to you
 scribes and Pharisees
 hypocrites! for you tithe mint and dill and cummin
 and have neglected the weightier matters of the law
 justice and mercy and faith; these you ought to have done
 without neglecting the others. ","You blind guides
 straining out a gnat and swallowing a camel!","\u201cWoe to you
 scribes and Pharisees
 hypocrites! for you cleanse the outside of the cup and of the plate

 scribes and Pharisees
 hypocrites! for you are like whitewashed tombs

 I say to you
 all this will come upon this generation.","\u201cO Jerusalem

 your house is forsaken and desolate. ","For I tell you
 you will not see me again

 \u2018I am the Christ

 most men\u2019s love will grow cold. ","But he who endures to the end will be saved.","And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached throughout the whole world
 as a testimony to all nations; and then the end will come.","\u201cSo when you see the desolating sacrilege spoken of by the prophet Daniel
 standing in the holy place (let the reader understand)
 ","then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains;","let him who is on the housetop not go down to take what is in his house;","and let him who is in the field not turn back to take his mantle.","And alas for those who are with child and for those who give suck in those days!","Pray that your flight may not be in winter or on a sabbath.","For then there will be great tribulation
 such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now
 no
 and never will be. ","And if those days had not been shortened
 no human being would be saved; but for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened. ","Then if any one says to you
 \u2018Lo
 here is the Christ!\u2019 or \u2018There he is!\u2019 do not believe it. ","For false Christs and false prophets will arise and show great signs and wonders
 so as to lead astray
 if possible
 even the elect. ","Lo
 I have told you beforehand. ","So
 if they say to you
 \u2018Lo
 he is in the wilderness
\u2019 do not go out; if they say
 \u2018Lo
 he is in the inner rooms
\u2019 do not believe it. ","For as the lightning comes from the east and shines as far as the west
 so will be the coming of the Son of man. ","Wherever the body is
 there the eagles will be gathered together.","\u201cImmediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened
 and the moon will not give its light
 and the stars will fall from heaven
 and the powers of the heavens will be shaken; ","then will appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven
 and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn
 and they will see the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory; ","and he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call
 and they will gather his elect from the four winds
 from one end of heaven to the other.","\u201cFrom the fig tree learn its lesson: as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts forth its leaves
 you know that summer is near. ","So also
 when you see all these things
 you know that he is near
 at the very gates. ","Truly
 I say to you
 this generation will not pass away till all these things take place. ","Heaven and earth will pass away
 but my words will not pass away.","\u201cBut of that day and hour no one knows
 not even the angels of heaven
 nor the Son
 but the Father only. ","As were the days of Noah
 so will be the coming of the Son of man. ","For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking
 marrying and giving in marriage
 until the day when Noah entered the ark
 ","and they did not know until the flood came and swept them all away
 so will be the coming of the Son of man. ","Then two men will be in the field; one is taken and one is left.","Two women will be grinding at the mill; one is taken and one is left.","Watch therefore
 for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming. ","But know this
 that if the householder had known in what part of the night the thief was coming
 he would have watched and would not have let his house be broken into. ","Therefore you also must be ready; for the Son of man is coming at an hour you do not expect.","\u201cWho then is the faithful and wise servant
 whom his master has set over his household
 to give them their food at the proper time? ","Blessed is that servant whom his master when he comes will find so doing.","Truly
 I say to you
 he will set him over all his possessions. ","But if that wicked servant says to himself
 \u2018My master is delayed
\u2019 ","and begins to beat his fellow servants
 and eats and drinks with the drunken
 ","the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know

 and put him with the hypocrites; there men will weep and gnash their teeth.","\u201cThen the kingdom of heaven shall be compared to ten maidens who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom.","Five of them were foolish
 and five were wise. ","For when the foolish took their lamps
 they took no oil with them; ","but the wise took flasks of oil with their lamps.","As the bridegroom was delayed
 they all slumbered and slept. ","But at midnight there was a cry

 for you know neither the day nor the hour.","\u201cFor it will be as when a man going on a journey called his servants and entrusted to them his property;","to one he gave five talents
 to another two
 to another one

 he who had the two talents made two talents more. ","But he who had received the one talent went and dug in the ground and hid his master\u2019s money.","Now after a long time the master of those servants came and settled accounts with them.","And he who had received the five talents came forward
 bringing five talents more

 good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a little
 I will set you over much; enter into the joy of your master.\u2019 ","And he also who had the two talents came forward

 \u2018Master
 you delivered to me two talents; here I have made two talents more.\u2019 ","His master said to him
 \u2018Well done
 good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a little

 \u2018Master
 I knew you to be a hard man
 reaping where you did not sow
 and gathering where you did not winnow; ","so I was afraid
 and I went and hid your talent in the ground. Here you have what is yours.\u2019 ","But his master answered him
 \u2018You wicked and slothful servant! You knew that I reap where I have not sowed
 and gather where I have not winnowed? ","Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers
 and at my coming I should have received what was my own with interest. ","So take the talent from him
 and give it to him who has the ten talents. ","For to every one who has will more be given
 and he will have abundance; but from him who has not
 even what he has will be taken away. ","And cast the worthless servant into the outer darkness; there men will weep and gnash their teeth.\u2019","\u201cWhen the Son of man comes in his glory
 and all the angels with him

 \u201cSit here
 while I go yonder and pray.\u201d ","Then he said to them
 \u201cMy soul is very sorrowful
 even to death; remain here
 and watch with me.\u201d ","And going a little farther he fell on his face and prayed
 \u201cMy Father
 if it be possible
 let this cup pass from me; nevertheless
 not as I will
 but as thou wilt.\u201d ","And he came to the disciples and found them sleeping; and he said to Peter
 \u201cSo
 could you not watch with me one hour? ","Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation; the spirit indeed is willing
 but the flesh is weak.\u201d ","Again
 for the second time
 he went away and prayed
 \u201cMy Father
 if this cannot pass unless I drink it
 thy will be done.\u201d ","Then he came to the disciples and said to them
 \u201cAre you still sleeping and taking your rest? Behold
 the hour is at hand
 and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. ","Rise
 let us be going; see
 my betrayer is at hand.\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cFriend
 why are you here?\u201d Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus and seized him. ","Then Jesus said to him
 \u201cPut your sword back into its place; for all who take the sword will perish by the sword. ","Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father
 and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of angels? ","But how then should the scriptures be fulfilled
 that it must be so?\u201d ","At that hour Jesus said to the crowds
 \u201cHave you come out as against a robber
 with swords and clubs to capture me? Day after day I sat in the temple teaching
 and you did not seize me. ","But all this has taken place
 that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.\u201d Then all the disciples forsook him and fled.","Jesus said to him
 \u201cYou have said so. But I tell you
 hereafter you will see the Son of man seated at the right hand of Power
 and coming on the clouds of heaven.\u201d ","And Peter remembered the saying of Jesus
 \u201cBefore the cock crows
 you will deny me three times.\u201d And he went out and wept bitterly.","Now Jesus stood before the governor; and the governor asked him
 \u201cAre you the King of the Jews?\u201d Jesus said to him
 \u201cYou have said so.\u201d ","And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice
 \u201cEli
 Eli
 la\u2032ma sabach-tha\u2032ni?\u201d that is
 \u201cMy God
 my God
 why hast thou forsaken me?\u201d ","And behold
 Jesus met them and said
 \u201cHail!\u201d And they came up and took hold of his feet and worshiped him. ","Then Jesus said to them
 \u201cDo not be afraid; go and tell my brethren to go to Galilee
 and there they will see me.\u201d","And Jesus came and said to them
 \u201cAll authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. ","Go therefore and make disciples of all nations
 baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit
 ","teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you; and lo
 I am with you always
 to the close of the age.\u201d","But Yeshua responded
 \u201cLet it happen now
 for in this way it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.\u201d So John yielded to Him.","But He replied
 \u201cIt is written
 \u2018Man shall not live by bread alone
 but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.\u2019\u201d","Yeshua said to him
 \u201cAgain it is written
 \u2018You shall not put Adonai your God to the test.\u2019\u201d","Then Yeshua says to him
 \u201cGo away
 satan! For it is written
 \u2018You shall worship Adonai your God
 and Him only shall you serve.\u2019\u201d","From then on
 Yeshua began to proclaim
 \u201cTurn away from your sins
 for the kingdom of heaven is near.\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cFollow Me
 and I will make you fishers of men.\u201d","\u201cBlessed are the poor in spirit
 for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.","\u201cBlessed are those who mourn
 for they shall be comforted.","\u201cBlessed are the meek
 for they shall inherit the earth.","\u201cBlessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness
 for they shall be satisfied.","\u201cBlessed are the merciful
 for they shall be shown mercy.","\u201cBlessed are the pure in heart
 for they shall see God.","\u201cBlessed are the peacemakers
 for they shall be called sons of God.","\u201cBlessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness

 on account of Me.","Rejoice and be glad
 for your reward in heaven is great! For in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.\u201d","\u201cYou are the salt of the earth; but if the salt should lose its flavor
 how shall it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything
 except to be thrown out and trampled under foot by men.","\u201cYou are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden.","Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a basket. Instead
 they put it on a lampstand so it gives light to all in the house.","In the same way
 let your light shine before men so they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven.\u201d","\u201cDo not think that I came to abolish the Torah or the Prophets! I did not come to abolish
 but to fulfill.","Amen
 I tell you
 until heaven and earth pass away
 not the smallest letter or serif shall ever pass away from the Torah until all things come to pass.","Therefore
 whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments
 and teaches others the same
 shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever keeps and teaches them
 this one shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.","For I tell you that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the Pharisees and Torah scholars
 you shall never enter the kingdom of heaven!","\u201cYou have heard it was said to those of old
 \u2018You shall not murder
 and whoever commits murder shall be subject to judgment.\u2019","But I tell you that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be subject to judgment. And whoever says to his brother
 \u2018Raca\u2019 shall be subject to the council; and whoever says
 \u2018You fool!\u2019 shall be subject to fiery Gehenna.","\u201cTherefore if you are presenting your offering upon the altar
 and there remember that your brother has something against you
","leave your offering there before the altar and go. First be reconciled to your brother
 and then come and present your offering.","\u201cMake friends quickly with your opponent while you are with him on the way. Otherwise
 your opponent may hand you over to the judge
 and the judge to the assistant
 and you will be thrown into prison.","Amen
 I tell you
 you will never get out of there until you have paid back the last penny!","\u201cYou have heard that it was said
 \u2018You shall not commit adultery.\u2019","But I tell you that everyone who looks upon a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.","And if your right eye causes you to stumble
 gouge it out and throw it away! It is better for you that one part of your body should be destroyed
 than that your whole body be thrown into Gehenna.","And if your right hand causes you to stumble
 cut it off and throw it away! It is better for you that one part of your body should be destroyed
 than that your whole body go into Gehenna.","\u201cIt was said
 \u2018Whoever sends his wife away
 let him give her a certificate of divorce.\u2019","But I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife
 except for sexual immorality
 makes her commit adultery; and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.","\u201cAgain
 you have heard that it was said to those of old
 \u2018You shall not swear falsely
 but shall carry out your oaths to Adonai.\u2019","But I tell you
 do not swear at all\u2014not by heaven
 for it is the throne of God;","or by the earth

 for you cannot make a single hair white or black.","But let your word \u2018Yes\u2019 be \u2018Yes\u2019 and your \u2018No
\u2019 \u2018No\u2019\u2014anything more than this is from the evil one.\u201d","\u201cYou have heard that it was said
 \u2018An eye for an eye

 do not resist an evildoer. But whoever slaps you on your right cheek

 let him also have your coat.","Whoever forces you to go one mile
 go with him two.","Give to the one who asks of you
 and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.","\u201cYou have heard that it was said
 \u2018You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.\u2019","But I tell you
 love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you
","so that you may be children of your Father in heaven. He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good
 and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.","For if you love those who love you
 what reward do you have? Even the tax collectors do the same
 don\u2019t they?","And if you greet only your brothers
 what more are you doing than anyone else? Even the pagans do that
 don\u2019t they?","Therefore be perfect
 just as your Father in heaven is perfect.\u201d","\u201cBeware of practicing your righteousness before others to be seen by them; otherwise you have no reward from your Father in heaven.","So whenever you do tzedakah
 do not sound a trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets

 I tell you
 they have their reward in full!","But when you do tzedakah
 do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing
","so that your tzedakah may be in secret; and your Father
 who sees in secret
 shall reward you.","\u201cWhen you pray
 do not be like the hypocrites; for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners
 so that they may be seen by others. Amen
 I tell you
 they have their reward in full!","But you
 when you pray
 go into your inner room; and when you have shut your door
 pray to your Father who is in secret. And your Father
 who sees in secret
 shall reward you.","And when you are praying
 do not babble on and on like the pagans; for they think they will be heard because of their many words.","Do not be like them
 for your Father knows what you need before you ask Him.","\u201cTherefore
 pray in this way: \u2018Our Father in heaven
 sanctified be Your name.","Your kingdom come
 Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.","Give us this day our daily bread.","And forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debtors.","And lead us not into temptation

 your heavenly Father will also forgive you.","But if you do not forgive others
 neither will your Father forgive your transgressions.","\u201cAnd whenever you fast
 do not become sad-faced like the hypocrites

 I tell you
 they have their reward in full!","But when you fast
 anoint your head and wash your face
","so that your fasting won\u2019t be evident to men

 who sees in secret
 will reward you.","\u201cDo not store up for yourselves treasures on earth
 where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal.","But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven
 where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in or steal.","For where your treasure is
 there will your heart be also.","\u201cThe eye is the lamp of the body. Therefore if your eye is good
 your whole body will be full of light.","But if your eye is bad
 your body will be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in you is darkness
 how great is the darkness!","\u201cNo one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other
 or he will stick by one and look down on the other. You cannot serve God and money.\u201d","\u201cSo I say to you
 do not worry about your life\u2014what you will eat or drink
 or about your body
 what you will wear. Isn\u2019t life more than food and the body more than clothing?","\u201cLook at the birds of the air. They do not sow or reap or gather into barns; yet your Father in heaven feeds them. Are you not of more value than they?","And which of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life?","And why do you worry about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field
 how they grow. They neither toil nor spin.","Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his glory clothed himself like one of these.","Now if in this way God clothes the grass\u2014which is here today and thrown into the furnace tomorrow\u2014will He not much more clothe you
 O you of little faith?","\u201cTherefore do not worry
 saying
 \u2018What will we eat?\u2019 or \u2018What will we drink?\u2019 or \u2018What will we wear?\u2019","For the pagans eagerly pursue all these things; yet your Father in heaven knows that you need all these.","But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness
 and all these things shall be added to you.","Therefore do not worry about tomorrow
 for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.\u201d","\u201cStop judging
 so that you may not be judged.","For with the judgment you judge
 you will be judged; and with the measure you use
 it will be measured to you.","\u201cWhy do you look at the speck in your brother\u2019s eye
 but do not notice the beam in your own eye?","Or how will you say to your brother
 \u2018Let me take the speck out of your eye
\u2019 and look
 the beam is in your own eye?","Hypocrite
 first take the beam out of your own eye
 and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother\u2019s eye.","\u201cDo not give what is holy to dogs or throw your pearls before pigs; otherwise they will trample them under their feet
 then turn and rip you to shreds.","\u201cAsk
 and it shall be given to you. Seek
 and you shall find. Knock
 and it shall be opened to you.","For everyone who asks receives
 and the one who seeks finds
 and to the one who knocks it shall be opened.","\u201cFor what man among you
 when his son asks him for bread
 will give him a stone?","Or when he asks for a fish
 will give him a snake?","If you then
 being evil
 know how to give good gifts to your children
 how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!","So in all things
 do to others what you would want them to do to you\u2014for this is the Torah and the Prophets.","\u201cEnter through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction
 and those who enter through it are many.","How narrow is the gate and difficult the way that leads to life
 and those who find it are few.\u201d","\u201cWatch out for false prophets
 who come to you in sheep\u2019s clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves.","You will recognize them by their fruit. Grapes aren\u2019t gathered from thorn bushes or figs from thistles
 are they?","Even so
 every good tree produces good fruit
 but the rotten tree produces bad fruit.","A good tree cannot produce bad fruit
 nor can a rotten tree produce good fruit.","Every tree that does not produce good fruit is chopped down and thrown into the fire.","So then
 you will recognize them by their fruit.","\u201cNot everyone who says to Me
 \u2018Lord
 Lord!\u2019 will enter the kingdom of heaven
 but he who does the will of My Father in heaven.","Many will say to Me on that day
 \u2018Lord
 Lord
 didn\u2019t we prophesy in Your name
 and drive out demons in Your name
 and perform many miracles in Your name?\u2019","Then I will declare to them
 \u2018I never knew you. Get away from Me
 you workers of lawlessness!\u2019\u201d","\u201cTherefore everyone who hears these words of Mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock.","And the rain fell
 and the floods came
 and the winds blew and beat against that house; and yet it did not fall
 for its foundation had been built on the rock.","Everyone who hears these words of Mine and does not act on them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.","And the rain fell
 and the floods came
 and the winds blew and beat against that house; and it fell\u2014and great was its fall.\u201d","Yeshua stretched out His hand and touched him
 saying
 \u201cI am willing. Be cleansed.\u201d Immediately his tzara\u2019at was cleansed.","And Yeshua said to him
 \u201cSee that you tell no one; but go show yourself to the kohen and offer the gift that Moses commanded
 as a testimony to them.\u201d","Yeshua said to him
 \u201cI\u2019ll come and heal him.\u201d","Now when Yeshua heard this
 He marveled and said to those who were following
 \u201cAmen
 I tell you
 I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith!","Moreover
 I tell you that many will come from the east and the west
 and they will recline at table with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.","But the sons of the kingdom will be driven out into the outer darkness; in that place will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\u201d","Then Yeshua said to the centurion
 \u201cGo. As you have believed
 let it be done for you.\u201d And the servant was healed in that same hour.","Yeshua tells him
 \u201cFoxes have dens and birds of the air have nests
 but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head.\u201d","But Yeshua tells him
 \u201cFollow Me
 and let the dead bury their own dead.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cWhy are you afraid
 O you of little faith?\u201d Then He got up and rebuked the winds and the sea
 and it became totally calm.","And He told them
 \u201cGo!\u201d So they came out and went into the pigs
 and the whole herd rushed down the cliff into the sea and drowned.","Just then
 some people brought to Him a paralyzed man lying on a cot. And seeing their faith
 Yeshua said to the paralyzed man
 \u201cTake courage
 son! Your sins are forgiven.\u201d","And knowing their thoughts
 Yeshua said
 \u201cWhy are you entertaining evil in your hearts?","For which is easier
 to say
 \u2018Your sins are forgiven
\u2019 or to say
 \u2018Get up and walk\u2019?","But so you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to pardon sins...\u201d Then He tells the paralyzed man
 \u201cGet up
 take your cot and go home.\u201d","As Yeshua was passing by from there
 He saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector\u2019s booth. He said to him
 \u201cFollow Me.\u201d And he got up and followed Him.","But when He heard this
 Yeshua said
 \u201cThose who are healthy have no need for a doctor
 but those who are sick do.","Now go and learn what this means: \u2018Mercy I desire
 and not sacrifice.\u2019 For I didn\u2019t come to call the righteous
 but the sinful.\u201d","And Yeshua said to them
 \u201cThe guests of the bridegroom cannot mourn while the bridegroom is with them
 can they? But the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them
 and then they will fast.","\u201cAnd no one puts a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment
 for the patch pulls away from the garment and a worse tear happens.","Nor do they put new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise the skins burst
 and the wine spills out and the skins are ruined. But they put new wine into fresh wineskins
 and both are preserved.\u201d","But then Yeshua turned and saw her. \u201cTake heart
 daughter
\u201d He said
 \u201cyour faith has made you well.\u201d That very hour the woman was healed.","He said
 \u201cGo away
 for the girl isn\u2019t dead
 but sleeping.\u201d And they began jeering at Him.","When He went into the house
 the blind men came to Him. And Yeshua said to them
 \u201cDo you believe that I am able to do this?\u201d \u201cYes
 Master
\u201d they said to Him.","And their eyes were opened. And Yeshua warned them sternly
 \u201cSee that no one knows.\u201d","Then He said to His disciples
 \u201cThe harvest is plentiful
 but the workers are few.","Therefore pray to the Lord of the harvest that He may send out workers into His harvest field.\u201d","Yeshua sent out these twelve and ordered them
 \u201cDo not go to the Gentiles

 find out who in it is worthy and stay there until you leave.","As you come into the house
 greet it.","If the household is worthy

 it will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the Day of Judgment than for that town.","\u201cBehold
 I am sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves
 so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves.","But beware of men
 for they will hand you over to the courts and flog you in their synagogues.","You will be brought before governors and kings because of Me
 as a witness to them and to the Gentiles.","But when they hand you over
 do not worry about how or what you should say
 for it shall be given to you in that hour what you should say.","For it is not you speaking

 flee to the next. Amen
 I tell you
 you will never finish going through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.","\u201cA disciple is not above his teacher
 nor a slave above his master.","It is enough for the disciple to become like his teacher

 for there is nothing concealed that will not be revealed and nothing hidden that will not be made known.","What I tell you in the darkness
 speak in the light; and what you hear in your ear

 I will also acknowledge him before My Father who is in heaven.","But whoever denies Me before men
 I will also deny him before My Father who is in heaven.","\u201cDo not think that I came to bring shalom on the earth; I did not come to bring shalom

 because they did not turn from their sins.","\u201cWoe to you
 Chorazin! Woe to you

 they would have turned long ago in sackcloth and ashes.","Nevertheless I tell you
 it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the Day of Judgment than for you.","And you
 Capernaum? Will you be lifted up to heaven? No
 you will go down to Sheol! For if the miracles done in you had been done in Sodom
 it would have remained to this day.","Nevertheless I tell you that it will be more bearable for the land of Sodom on the Day of Judgment than for you.\u201d","At that time Yeshua said in response
 \u201cI praise You

 \u2018I desire mercy
 not sacrifice
\u2019 you wouldn\u2019t have condemned the innocent.","For the Son of Man is Lord of Shabbat.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cWhat man among you will not grab his sheep and lift it out
 if it falls into a pit on Shabbat?","How much more valuable then is a man than a sheep! Therefore it is permitted to do good on Shabbat.\u201d","Then He said to the man
 \u201cStretch out your hand.\u201d And he stretched it out and it was restored
 as healthy as the other.","Knowing their thoughts
 Yeshua said to them
 \u201cEvery kingdom divided against itself is destroyed
 and every city or house divided against itself will not stand.","If satan drives out satan
 he is divided against himself; how then will his kingdom stand?","And if I drive out demons by beelzebul
 by whom do your sons drive them out? For this reason
 they will be your judges.","But if I drive out demons by the Ruach Elohim
 then the kingdom of God has come upon you.","Or how can one enter a strong man\u2019s house and carry off his property
 unless he first ties up the strong man? Then he will thoroughly plunder his house.","He who is not with Me is against Me
 and he who does not gather with Me scatters.","\u201cFor this reason I say to you
 every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men
 but blasphemy against the Ruach will not be forgiven.","Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven
 but whoever speaks against the Ruach ha-Kodesh will not be forgiven
 neither in this age nor in the one to come.\u201d","\u201cEither make the tree good and its fruit good
 or make the tree rotten and its fruit rotten; for the tree is known by its fruit.","You brood of vipers! How can you who are evil say anything good? For from the overflow of the heart the mouth speaks.","The good man from his good treasury brings forth good
 and the evil man from his evil treasury brings forth evil.","But I tell you that on the Day of Judgment
 men will give account for every careless word they speak.","For by your words you will be justified
 and by your words you will be condemned.\u201d","But Yeshua replied to them
 \u201cAn evil and adulterous generation clamors for a sign
 yet no sign shall be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet.","For just as Jonah was in the belly of the great fish for three days and three nights
 so the Son of Man will be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights.","The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it
 because they repented at the preaching of Jonah. And behold
 something greater than Jonah is here.","The Queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it
 for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon. And behold
 something greater than Solomon is here.","\u201cNow when an unclean spirit goes out of a man
 it passes through waterless places looking for rest and doesn\u2019t find it.","Then it says
 \u2018I\u2019ll go back home where I came from.\u2019 And when it comes
 it finds the house vacant
 swept clean
 and put in order.","Then it goes and brings along seven other spirits more evil than itself
 and they go in and live there. And that man\u2019s last condition becomes worse than the first. So also will it be for this evil generation.\u201d","While Yeshua was still speaking to the crowds
 His mother and brothers were standing outside
 trying to speak to Him.","But to the one telling Him this
 Yeshua responded
 \u201cWho is My mother? And who are My brothers?\u201d","Stretching out His hand toward His disciples
 He said
 \u201cHere are My mother and My brothers.","For whoever does the will of My Father in heaven
 he is My brother and sister and mother.\u201d","And He told them many things in parables
 saying
 \u201cBehold
 a sower went out to spread some seed.","As he was scattering the seed
 some seeds fell by the road; and the birds came and ate them up.","Other seeds fell on rocky ground
 where they didn\u2019t have much soil. They sprang up immediately
 because the soil wasn\u2019t deep.","But when the sun came up
 they were scorched; and because they had no roots
 they withered away.","Other seeds fell among the thorns
 and the thorns grew and choked them out.","But others fell on good soil and were producing fruit. They yielded a crop\u2014some a hundredfold
 some sixty
 some thirty.","He who has ears
 let him hear.\u201d","And He replied to them
 \u201cTo you has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven
 but to them it has not been given.","For whoever has
 to him more will be given and he will have plenty. But whoever does not have
 even what he has will be taken away from him.","For this reason I speak to them in parables
 because seeing they do not see
 and hearing they do not hear nor do they understand.","\u201cAnd in them the prophecy of Isaiah is being fulfilled
 which says
 \u2018You will keep on hearing but will never understand; you will keep looking
 but will never see.","For the heart of this people has become dull
 their ears can barely hear
 and they have shut their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes
 hear with their ears
 and understand with their hearts. Then they would turn back
 and I would heal them.\u2019","\u201cBut blessed are your eyes because they see
 and your ears because they hear.","Amen
 I tell you
 many a prophet and tzaddik longed to see what you are seeing and did not see
 and to hear what you are hearing and did not hear.\u201d","\u201cYou then
 hear the parable of the sower.","When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and doesn\u2019t understand it
 the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is the one having been sown along the road.","\u201cThe one sown on rocky ground
 this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy.","Yet he has no root himself but lasts only a short while; and when trouble or persecution comes because of the word
 immediately he falls away.","\u201cBut the one sown among the thorns
 this is the one who hears the word; and the worries of the world and the seduction of wealth choke the word
 and it becomes unfruitful.","\u201cNow the one sown on the good soil
 this is the one who hears the word and understands. He indeed bears fruit
 yielding a hundredfold
 some sixty
 some thirty times what was sown.\u201d","He presented to them another parable
 saying
 \u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.","But while the men were sleeping
 his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and went away.","Now when the stalk sprouted and produced grain
 then the weeds also appeared.","So the slaves of the landowner came and said to him
 \u2018Master
 didn\u2019t you sow good seed in your field? Then where did the weeds come from?\u2019","But he replied
 \u2018An enemy did this.\u2019 Now the slaves say to him
 \u2018Do you want us
 then
 to go out and gather them up?\u2019","But he says
 \u2018No
 for while you are gathering up the weeds
 you may uproot the wheat with them.","Let both grow together until the harvest. At harvest time
 I will tell the reapers
 \u201cFirst
 gather up the weeds and tie them in bundles to burn them up; but gather the wheat into my barn.\u2019\u201d","He presented to them another parable
 saying
 \u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed
 which a man took and planted in his field.","It\u2019s the smallest of all seeds; yet when it\u2019s full grown
 it\u2019s greater than the other herbs. It becomes like a tree
 so that the birds of the air come and nest in its branches.\u201d","He told them another parable
 \u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like hametz
 which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour
 until it was all leavened.\u201d","He answered
 \u201cThe one sowing the good seed is the Son of Man
","and the field is the world. And the good seed
 these are the sons of the kingdom; and the weeds are the sons of the evil one.","The enemy who sowed them is the devil
 the harvest is the end of the age
 and the reapers are angels.","Therefore just as the weeds are gathered up and burned with fire
 so shall it be at the end of the age.","The Son of Man will send forth His angels
 and they will gather out of His kingdom all stumbling blocks and those who practice lawlessness.","They will throw them into the fiery furnace; in that place will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.","Then the righteous will shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears
 let him hear!","\u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field
 which a man found and hid. And because of his joy
 he goes out and sells all that he has and buys that field.","\u201cAgain
 the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant searching for fine pearls.","Upon finding a pearl of great value
 he went out and sold all that he had and bought it.","\u201cAgain
 the kingdom of heaven is like a dragnet that was cast into the sea
 gathering things of every kind.","When it was filled
 they pulled it ashore; and they sat down and gathered up the good into containers
 but threw the bad away.","So it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come forth and separate the wicked from among the righteous","and throw them into the fiery furnace; in that place will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.","\u201cHave you understood all these things?\u201d They said to Him
 \u201cYes.\u201d","Then He said to them
 \u201cTherefore every Torah scholar discipled for the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a household who brings out of his treasure both new things and old.\u201d","And they took offense at Him. But Yeshua said to them
 \u201cA prophet is not without honor except in his hometown and in his own house.\u201d","But Yeshua said to them
 \u201cThey don\u2019t need to leave\u2014you give them something to eat.\u201d","\u201cBring them here to Me
\u201d He said.","But immediately
 Yeshua spoke to them
 saying
 \u201cTake courage! I am. Don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d","And He said
 \u201cCome!\u201d And Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water to go to Yeshua.","Immediately Yeshua reached out His hand and grabbed him. And He said to him
 \u201cO you of little faith
 why did you doubt?\u201d","And answering
 He said to them
 \u201cWhy do you also transgress the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?","For God said
 \u2018Honor your father and mother\u2019 and \u2018He who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.\u2019","But you say
 \u2018Whoever tells his father or mother
 \u201cWhatever you might have gained from me is a gift to God
\u201d","he need not honor his father.\u2019 On account of your tradition
 you made void the word of God.","Hypocrites! Rightly did Isaiah prophesy about you
 saying
","\u2018This people honors Me with their lips
 but their heart is far from Me.","And in vain they worship Me
 teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.\u2019\u201d","Then Yeshua called the crowd and said to them
 \u201cHear and understand.","It\u2019s not what goes into the mouth that makes the man unholy; but what comes out of the mouth
 this makes the man unholy.\u201d","But He replied
 \u201cEvery plant that My heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted.","Leave them alone; they are blind guides of the blind. And if a blind man leads a blind man
 both will fall into a pit.\u201d","\u201cAre you also still lacking understanding?\u201d Yeshua said.","\u201cDon\u2019t you grasp that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the stomach and then is ejected into the sewer?","But the things that proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart
 and those things make the man unholy.","For out of the heart come evil thoughts
 murder
 adultery
 sexual immorality
 theft
 false witness
 and slander.","These are the things that make the man unholy; but to eat with unwashed hands does not make the man unholy.\u201d","But He responded
 \u201cI was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\u201d","And answering
 He said
 \u201cIt\u2019s not right to take the children\u2019s bread and throw it to the dogs.\u201d","Then answering
 Yeshua said to her
 \u201cO woman
 great is your faith! Let it be done for you as you wish.\u201d And her daughter was healed in that very hour.","Yeshua called His disciples and said
 \u201cI have compassion for the crowd
 because they\u2019ve stayed with Me for three days now and have nothing to eat. I don\u2019t want to send them away hungry
 because they might pass out on the way.\u201d","Yeshua said to them
 \u201cHow many loaves do you have?\u201d \u201cSeven
\u201d they said
 \u201cand a few small fish.\u201d","But He replied to them
 \u201cWhen evening comes

\u2019","and in the morning
 \u2018Stormy weather today

 He went away.","\u201cWatch out
\u201d Yeshua said to them
 \u201cand beware of the hametz of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\u201d","But knowing this
 Yeshua said
 \u201cO you of little faith

 and how many baskets of leftovers you gathered?","Or how about the seven loaves for the four thousand and all the baskets of leftovers you gathered?","How is it that you don\u2019t understand that I wasn\u2019t talking to you about bread? Now beware of the hametz of the Pharisees and Sadducees!\u201d","When Yeshua came into the region of Caesarea Philippi
 He asked His disciples

 \u201cIf anyone wants to follow after Me
 he must deny himself
 take up his cross
 and follow Me.","For whoever wants to save his life will lose it

 you\u2019ll find a coin. Take that

 but woe to that man through whom the snare comes!","\u201cAnd if your hand or your foot causes you to stumble
 cut it off and throw it away from you. It\u2019s better for you to enter into life crippled or lame than
 having two hands or two feet
 to be thrown into fiery Gehenna.","If your eye causes you to stumble
 pluck it out and throw it away from you. It\u2019s better for you to enter into life with one eye than
 having two eyes
 to be thrown into fiery Gehenna.","\u201cSee that you do not despise one of these little ones

 the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wanted to settle accounts with his slaves.","When he had begun to settle up
 a man was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents.","But since he didn\u2019t have the money to repay
 his master ordered him to be sold
 along with his wife and children and all that he had
 and payment to be made.","Then the slave fell on his knees and begged him

 \u2018Be patient with me

 \u2018Pay back what you owe!\u2019","\u201cSo his fellow slave fell down and kept begging him
 saying
 \u2018Be patient with me
 and I\u2019ll pay you back.\u2019","Yet he was unwilling. Instead
 he went off and threw the man into prison until he paid back all he owed.","\u201cSo when his fellow slaves saw what had happened
 they were deeply distressed. They went to their master and reported in detail all that had happened.","Then summoning the first slave
 his master said to him
 \u2018You wicked slave! I forgave all that debt because you pleaded with me.","Wasn\u2019t it necessary for you also to show mercy to your fellow slave
 just as I showed mercy to you?\u2019","Enraged
 the master handed him over to the torturers until he paid back all he owed.","\u201cSo also My heavenly Father will do to you
 unless each of you
 from your hearts
 forgives his brother.\u201d","\u201cHaven\u2019t you read?\u201d He answered. \u201cHe who created them from the beginning \u2018made them male and female\u2019","and said
 \u2018For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife

 but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together
 let no man separate.\u201d","Yeshua said to them
 \u201cBecause of your hardness of heart Moses permitted you to divorce your wives
 but from the beginning it was not so.","Now I tell you
 whoever divorces his wife
 except for sexual immorality
 and marries another
 commits adultery.\u201d","But He said to them
 \u201cNot everyone can accept this saying\u2014only those to whom it has been given.","For there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mother\u2019s womb; and there are eunuchs who were made that way by men; and there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.

 let him accept it.\u201d","But Yeshua said
 \u201cLet the little children come to Me and do not hinder them

 keep the commandments.\u201d","\u201cWhich ones?\u201d he said. Yeshua said
 \u201c\u2018Do not murder
 do not commit adultery

 who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.","Now when he had agreed with the workers for a denarius per day
 he sent them into his vineyard.","And he went out about the third hour and saw others standing in the marketplace
 idle.","And to them he said
 \u2018You go into the vineyard too

 \u2018You go into the vineyard
 too.\u2019","\u201cNow when evening came
 the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman
 \u2018Call the workers and pay them their wages
 beginning from the last to the first.\u2019","And those who had come about the eleventh hour each received a denarius.","And when the first came
 they supposed that they would receive more; yet they too received a denarius.","\u201cBut when they received it
 they began to grumble against the master of the house
","saying
 \u2018These last guys did one hour

 \u2018Out of the mouth of babes and nursing toddlers You have prepared praise for Yourself\u2019?\u201d","Seeing a lone fig tree by the road
 He came up to it and found nothing on it except leaves only. And He said to it
 \u201cMay no fruit ever come from you again!\u201d And the fig tree shriveled up at once.","Yeshua answered them
 \u201cAmen
 I tell you
 if you have faith and do not doubt
 not only will you do what was done to the fig tree

\u2019 it will happen.","And whatever you ask in prayer
 trusting
 you shall receive.\u201d","Yeshua replied to them
 \u201cI also will ask you one question. If you tell Me
 I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things.","John\u2019s immersion

 \u2018Then why didn\u2019t you believe him?\u2019","So answering Yeshua
 they said
 \u201cWe don\u2019t know.\u201d Then He said to them
 \u201cNeither am I telling you by what authority I do these things.\u201d","\u201cNow what do you think? A man had two sons

 \u2018I won\u2019t
\u2019 but afterward he had a change of heart and went.","The man went to the second son and said the same thing. But he answered
 \u2018I will

 you had no change of heart to believe him.\u201d","\u201cListen to another parable. There was a master of a household who planted a vineyard. He put a hedge around it
 dug a winepress in it

 he sent his servants to the tenants to collect his fruit.","But grabbing his servants
 the tenants beat up one
 killed another

 \u2018They will respect my son.\u2019","\u201cBut when the tenants saw the son
 they said among themselves
 \u2018This is the heir! Come on
 let\u2019s kill him and get his inheritance!\u2019","So grabbing him
 they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.","Therefore when the master of the vineyard comes
 what will he do to those tenants?\u201d","\u201cHe will bring those miserable men to a miserable end

 \u201cHave you never read in the Scriptures? \u2018The stone which the builders rejected

 the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to people producing its fruits.","Whoever falls on this stone will be shattered; but the one upon whom it falls
 it will crush him.\u201d","\u201cThe kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who made a wedding feast for his son.","He sent out his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding feast

 they went away
 one to his own farm

 he destroyed those murderers and set fire to their city.","\u201cThen he said to his servants
 \u2018The wedding feast is ready
 but those who were invited were not worthy.","So go into the highways and byways
 and invite everyone you find to the wedding feast.\u2019","And those servants went out into the highways and gathered together all they found
 both bad and good; and the wedding was filled with guests.","\u201cBut when the king came in to look over the guests
 he saw a man there who wasn\u2019t dressed in wedding clothes.","\u2018Friend
\u2019 he said to him
 \u2018how did you get in here without wedding clothes?\u2019 But the man was silent.","Then the king said to his servants
 \u2018Tie him up hand and foot
 and throw him into the outer darkness; in that place will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\u2019","For many are called
 but few are chosen.\u201d","But Yeshua
 knowing their wickedness

 this generation will not pass away until all these things happen.","Heaven and earth will pass away

 you have what is yours.\u2019","\u201cBut his master responded
 \u2018You wicked
 lazy servant! You knew that I reap where I didn\u2019t sow and gather where I scattered no seed?","Then you should have brought my money to the brokers

 more shall be given

 that to the land of Sodom it shall be less pain in the day of doom
 than to thee. ","In that time Jesus answered
 and said

 and be charged

 and I shall fulfill you [and I shall refresh
 or fulfill
 you]. ","Take ye my yoke on you [Take ye my yoke upon you]

 Whether ye have not read
 what David did
 when he hungered
 and they that were with him? ","how he entered into the house of God
 and ate loaves of proposition
 which loaves it was not leaveful to him to eat
 neither to them that were with him
 but to priests alone?[a] ","Or whether ye have not read in the law
 that in the sabbaths priests in the temple defoul the sabbaths
 and they be without blame? ","And I say to you
 that here is a greater than the temple. [Soothly I say to you
 for this is more than the temple.] ","And if ye knew
 what it is
 I will mercy
 and not sacrifice
 ye should never have condemned innocents. ","For man's Son is Lord
 yea
 of the sabbath. [Truly man's Son is Lord also of the sabbath.] ","And he said to them
 What man of you shall there be
 that hath one sheep
 and if it fall into a ditch in the sabbaths
 whether he shall not (take) hold
 and lift it up? ","How much more is a man better than a sheep? Therefore it is leaveful to do good in the sabbaths [in the sabbath].","Then he said to the man
 Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched forth; and it was restored to health as the other. ","And Jesus
 witting their thoughts
 said to them
 Each kingdom parted against itself
 shall be desolated [shall be desolate]
 and each city
 or house
 parted against itself
 shall not stand. ","And if Satan casteth out Satan [And if Satan cast out Satan]
 he is parted against himself; therefore how shall his kingdom stand? ","And if I in Beelzebub cast out devils
 in whom your sons cast out? Therefore they shall be your doomsmen. ","But if I in the Spirit of God cast out fiends
 then the kingdom of God is come into you. ","Either how may any man enter into the house of a strong man
 and take away his vessels
 but he first bind the strong man
 and then he shall spoil his house? ","He that is not with me
 is against me; and he that gathereth not together with me
 scattereth abroad. ","Therefore I say to you
 all sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven to men
 but [the] blasphemy of the Spirit shall not be forgiven. ","And whoever saith a word against man's Son
 it shall be forgiven to him; but who that saith a word against the Holy Ghost
 it shall not be forgiven to him
 neither in this world
 nor in the tother. ","Either make ye the tree good
 and his fruit good; either make ye the tree evil and his fruit evil [or make ye the tree evil
 and his fruit evil]; for a tree is known of his fruit. ","Ye generation of adders
 how be ye able to speak good things
 when ye be evil? For the mouth speaketh of the plenty of the heart. [Ye generation of adders
 how may ye speak good things
 when ye be evil? Soothly the mouth speaketh of the great abundance of the heart.] ","A good man bringeth forth good things of good treasure
 and an evil man bringeth forth evil things of evil treasure. ","And I say to you
 that of every idle word
 that men speak
 they shall yield reason thereof in the day of doom; ","for of thy words thou shalt be justified
 and of thy words thou shalt be condemned. ","Which answered
 and said to them
 An evil kindred and a spouse-breaker seeketh a token [An evil generation and adulterous seeketh a token]
 and a token shall not be given to it
 but the token of Jonas
 the prophet. ","For as Jonas was in the womb of a whale three days and three nights
 so man's Son shall be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights. ","Men of Nineveh shall rise in doom with this generation
 and shall condemn it; for they did penance in the preaching of Jonas
 and lo! here [is] a greater than Jonas. ","The queen of the south shall rise in doom with this generation
 and shall condemn it; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon

 he goeth by dry places
 seeking rest
 and findeth not.[c] ","Then he saith
 I shall turn again into mine house

 and taketh with him seven other spirits worse than himself; and they enter [in]
 and dwell there. And the last things of that man be made worse than the former. So it shall be [and] to this worst generation. ","Yet while he spake to the people
 lo! his mother and his brethren stood withoutforth
 seeking to speak with him. ","And he answered to the man
 that spake to him
 and said
 Who is my mother? and who be my brethren? ","And he held forth his hand into his disciples
 and said
 Lo! my mother and my brethren; ","for whoever doeth the will of my Father that is in heavens

 and said [saying]
 Lo! he that soweth
 went out to sow his seed. ","And while he soweth
 some seeds felled [fell] beside the way
 and birds of the air came
 and ate them. ","But other seeds [Soothly other] felled into stony places
 where they had not much earth; and at once [and anon] they sprung up

 they parched [they sweltered

 and for they had not root
 they dried up. ","And other seeds [Forsooth other] felled among thorns; and the thorns waxed up
 and strangled them. ","But other seeds [But other] felled into good land
 and gave fruit; some an hundredfold

 [and] another thirtyfold. ","He that hath ears of hearing
 hear he. ","And he answered
 and said to them
 For to you it is given to know the privates of the kingdom of heavens; but it is not given to them.[a] ","For it shall be given to him that hath
 and he shall have plenty; but if a man hath not [truly who that hath not]
 also that thing that he hath shall be taken away from him. ","Therefore I speak to them in parables
 for they seeing see not
 and they hearing hear not
 neither understand; ","that the prophecy of Esaias' saying be fulfilled in them [that the prophecy of Easias be filled in them
 that saith]
 With hearing ye shall hear
 and ye shall not understand; and ye seeing shall see
 and ye shall not see; ","for the heart of this people is greatly fatted[b]

 and they have closed their eyes
 lest sometime they see with eyes
 and with ears hear
 and understand in heart

 and I heal them. ","But your eyes that see be blessed
 and your ears that hear. ","Forsooth I say [truly] to you
 that many prophets and just men coveted to see those things that ye see
 and they saw not
 and to hear those things that ye hear
 and they heard not. ","Therefore hear ye the parable of the sower.","Each that heareth the word of the realm
 and understandeth not
 the evil spirit cometh
 and snatcheth (up) that that is sown in his heart; this it is [this is he]

 this it is [Forsooth he that is sown in stony land
 is this]
 that heareth the word of God
 and anon with joy taketh it. ","And he hath not root in himself
 but is temporal. For when tribulation and persecution is made for the word
 at once he is caused to stumble [anon he is offended]. ","But he that is sown in thorns

 and it is made without fruit. ","But he that is sown into good land
 is this that heareth the word
 and understandeth

 and said [saying]
 The kingdom of heavens is made like to a man
 that sowed good seed in his field. ","And when men slept
 his enemy came
 and sowed above tares in the middle of [the] wheat
 and went away.[c]","But when the herb was grown [Soothly when the herb had grown]
 and made fruit
 then the tares appeared. ","And the servants of the husbandman came
 and said to him
 Lord
 whether hast thou not sown good seed in thy field? whereof then hath it tares? ","And he said to them
 An enemy hath done this thing. And the servants said to him
 Wilt thou that we go
 and gather them? ","And he said
 Nay
 lest peradventure ye in gathering [the] tares draw up with them [also] the wheat by the root.[d] ","Suffer ye them both to wax into reaping time; and in the time of ripe corn I shall say to the reapers
 First gather ye together the tares
 and bind them together in knitches to be burnt
 but gather ye the wheat into my barn.[e]","Another parable Jesus put forth to them
 and said [saying]
 The kingdom of heavens is like to a corn of mustard seed
 which a man took
 and sowed in his field. ","Which [truly] is the least of all seeds
 but when it hath waxen
 it is the most of all worts
 and is made a tree; so that birds of the air come
 and dwell in the boughs thereof[f]. ","Another parable Jesus spake to them [He spake another parable to them]
 The kingdom of heavens is like to sourdough
 which a woman took
 and hid in three measures of meal
 till it were all soured. ","Which answered
 and said
 He that soweth good seed is man's Son; ","the field is the world; but the good seed
 be sons of the kingdom
 but tares
 these be evil children;[h] ","the enemy that soweth them is the fiend [but the enemy that soweth them is the devil]; and the ripe corn is the ending of the world
 [forsooth] the reapers be angels. ","Therefore as tares be gathered together
 and be burnt in fire [and burnt in the fire]
 so it shall be in the ending of the world. ","Man's Son shall send his angels
 and they shall gather from his realm all causes of stumbling [and they shall gather of his realm all offences]
 and them that do wickedness; ","and they shall send them into the chimney of fire; there shall be weeping and beating together of teeth.","Then just men shall shine as the sun
 in the realm of their Father. He that hath ears of hearing
 hear he. ","The kingdom of heavens is like to treasure hid in a field
 which a man that findeth
 hideth; and for joy of it he goeth [and for joy thereof he goeth]
 and selleth all things that he hath
 and buyeth that field. ","Again the kingdom of heavens is like to a merchant
 that seeketh good margarites; [Again the kingdom of heavens is like to a man merchant
 seeking good pearls;]","but when he hath found one precious margarite [soothly one precious pearl found]
 he went
 and sold all things that he had
 and bought it. ","Again the kingdom of heavens is like to a net cast into the sea
 and that gathereth together of all kinds of fishes [of all kind of fishes]; ","which when it was full
 they drew it up
 and sat by the brink
 and chose the good into their vessels
 but the evil they cast out [but they cast out the evil]. ","So it shall be in the end of the world. Angels shall go out
 and shall separate evil men from the middle of just men. [So it shall be in the ending of the world. Angels shall go out
 and shall part evil men from the midst of just men.] ","And they shall send them into the chimney of fire; there shall be weeping and grinding of teeth [there shall be weeping and beating together of teeth].","Have ye understood all these things? They say to him
 Yea. ","He saith to them
 Therefore every wise man of [the] law in the kingdom of heavens [Therefore every writer taught in the kingdom of heavens]
 is like to an husbandman
 that bringeth forth of his treasure new things and old. ","And so they were offended in him. But Jesus said to them
 A prophet is not without honour [A prophet is not without worship]
 but in his own country
 and in his own house. ","Jesus said to them
 They have not need to go; give ye them somewhat to eat.[a] ","And he said to them
 Bring ye them hither to me. ","And at once Jesus spake to them
 and said [And anon Jesus spake to them
 saying]
 Have ye trust
 I am; do not ye dread. ","And he said
 Come thou. And Peter went down from the boat
 and walked on the waters to come to Jesus.","And at once Jesus held forth his hand
 and took Peter [And anon Jesus
 holding forth his hand

 Thou of little faith

 and said to them
 Why [also] break ye the commandment of God for your tradition? ","For God said
 Honour thy father and thy mother [Honour thy father and mother]

 Whoever saith to father or mother [But ye say

 It is not good to take the bread of children

 and did in like manner. ","But about the eleventh hour he went out
 and found others standing; and said to them
 What stand ye idle here all day [What stand ye here idle all day]? ","They say to him
 For no man hath hired us. He saith to them
 Go ye also into my vineyard. ","And when evening was come
 the lord of the vineyard saith to his procurator
 Call the workmen
 and yield to them their hire
 and begin thou at the last till to the first [beginning at the last till to the first]. ","And so when they were come
 that came about the eleventh hour
 also they took every each of them a penny.[a] ","But the first came
 and deemed
 that they should take more
 but they took each one by themselves a penny;[b] ","and in the taking they grumbled against the husbandman
 [And they taking grutched against the husbandman
] ","and said [saying]
 These last wrought one hour
 and thou hast made them even to us
 that have borne the charge of the day
 and [the] heat? ","And he answered to one of them
 and said
 Friend
 I do thee none wrong [Friend
 I do thee no wrong]; whether thou hast not accorded with me for a penny? ","Take thou that that is thine
 and go; for I will give to this last man
 as to thee.[c] ","Whether it is not leaveful to me to do that that I will? Whether thine eye is wicked
 for I am good? ","So the last shall be the first
 and the first the last; for many be called
 but few be chosen [for many be called

 What wilt thou? She saith to him
 Say that these two my sons sit [Say that these my two sons sit]

 Ye know not what ye ask. Be ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of [Be ye able to drink the cup that I am to drink]? They say to him
 We be able. ","But Jesus called them to him
 and said
 Ye know
 that [the] princes of heathen men be lords of them

 but to serve
 and to give his life redemption for many. ","And Jesus stood
 and called them
 and said
 What will ye
 that I do to you? ","and said to them [saying to them]
 Go ye into the castle that is against you

 and bring to me. ","And if any man say to you any thing
 say ye
 that the Lord hath need to them; and at once he shall let them go [and anon he shall leave them]. ","And he said to them
 It is written
 Mine house shall be called an house of prayer [My house shall be called an house of prayer]; but ye have made it a den of thieves. ","and said to him
 Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus said to them [Soothly Jesus saith to them]
 Yea; whether ye have never read
 That of the mouth of young children
 and of suckling children
 thou hast made perfect praising? ","And he saw a fig tree beside the way
 and came to it
 and found nothing therein [and found nothing thereon] but leaves only. And he said to it
 Never fruit come forth of thee [Never be fruit born of thee]

 and said to them
 Truly I say to you

 Take [away thee]
 and cast thee into the sea
 it shall be done so [it shall be done]. ","And all things whatever ye believing shall ask in prayer
 ye shall take. [And all things whatever ye shall ask in prayer believing
 ye shall take.] ","Jesus answered
 and said to them
 And I shall ask you one word

 I shall say to you
 in what power I do these things. ","Of whence was the baptism of John; of heaven
 or of men? And they thought within themselves
 saying
 If we [shall] say of heaven
 he shall say to us
 Why then believe ye not to him? ","And they answered to Jesus
 and said
 We know not. And he said to them
 Neither I say to you
 in what power I do these things. ","But what seemeth to you? A man had two sons [Some man had two sons]; and he came to the first
 and said
 Son

 and said
 I will not; but afterward he repented
 and went forth [but afterward he stirred by penance
 or repenting
 went]. ","But he came to the other
 and said in like manner. And he answered
 and said
 Lord
 I go; and he went not. ","Who of the twain did the father's will? They say to him
 The first. Jesus saith to them
 Truly I say to you
 for publicans and whores shall go before you into the kingdom of God. ","For John came to you in the way of rightwiseness
 and ye believed not to him; but publicans and whores believed to him. But ye saw

 that planted a vineyard
 and hedged it about
 and delved a presser therein
 and builded a tower [and built a tower]
 and hired it to earth-tillers
 and went far in pilgrimage. ","And when the time of fruits approached
 he sent his servants to the earth-tillers
 to take fruits of it.[d] ","And the earth-tillers took his servants
 and they beat one

 his servants taken
 the earth-tillers beat one

 more than the first
 and in like manner they did to them [and they did to them in like manner]. ","And at the last he sent his son to them
 and said [saying]
 They shall dread my son. ","But the earth-tillers
 seeing the son
 said within themselves
 This is the heir; come ye
 slay we him
 and we shall have his heritage. ","And they took him
 and casted [cast] him out of the vineyard
 and slew him. ","Therefore when the lord of the vineyard shall come
 what shall he do to those earth-tillers? ","They say to him
 He shall destroy evil the evil men
 and he shall set to hire his vineyard to other earth-tillers
 which shall yield to him fruit in their times.[e] ","Jesus saith to them
 Read ye never in scriptures
 The stone which the builders reproved
 this is made into the head of the corner? Of the Lord this thing is done
 and it is marvelous in our eyes. ","Therefore I say to you
 that the kingdom of God shall be taken from you
 and shall be given to a folk doing [the] fruits of it.[f] ","And he that shall fall on this stone
 shall be broken; but on whom it shall fall
 it shall bruise him all to pieces [it shall pound him all to pieces]. ","The kingdom of heavens is made like to a king that made weddings to his son. [The kingdom of heavens is like to a man king that made weddings to his son.]","And he sent his servants to call men that were bidden to the weddings

 and went forth
 one into his town
 another to his merchandise. [Soothly they despised

 and tormented them
 and slew [them]. ","But the king
 when he had heard
 was wroth; and he sent his hosts
 and destroyed those man-quellers

 The weddings be ready

 were not worthy. ","Therefore go ye into the ends of ways
 and whomever ye find
 call ye to the weddings. [Therefore go ye to the outgoings

 of ways

 call to the weddings.] ","And his servants went out into the ways
 and gathered together all that they found
 good and evil; and the bridal [and the weddings] was full-filled with men sitting at the meat. ","And the king entered
 to see men sitting at the meat; and he saw there a man not clothed with bride clothes [and he saw there a man not clothed with bridal clothes]. ","And he said to him
 Friend
 how enteredest thou hither without bride clothes [And he saith to him
 Friend
 how enteredest thou hither
 not having bride clothes]? And he was dumb. ","Then the king bade his ministers
 Bind him both hands and feet
 and send ye him into outer-more darknesses; there shall be weeping and grinding of teeth. [Then the king said to the ministers
 His hands and feet bound

 Whose is this image
 and the writing above? ","They say to him
 The emperor's. Then he said to them
 Therefore yield ye to the emperor those things that be the emperor's

 and said to them
 Ye err
 not knowing the scriptures
 nor the virtue of God. ","For in the rising again to life
 neither they shall wed
 neither shall be wedded [For in the rising again

 but ye shall not all-gates have me.] ","For this woman sending this ointment into my body
 did [for] to bury me. ","Truly I say to you
 where ever this gospel shall be preached in all the world
 it shall be said
 that she did this
 in mind of him [it shall be said and that this woman did
 into mind of him]. ","[And] Jesus said
 Go ye into the city to a man
 and say to him
 The master saith
 My time is nigh; at thee I make pask with my disciples. ","And he said to them
 as they ate
 Truly I say to you
 that one of you shall betray me. ","And he answered
 and said
 He that putteth with me his hand in the platter
 [this] shall betray me. ","Forsooth man's Son goeth
 as it is written of him; but woe to that man
 by whom man's Son shall be betrayed; it were good to him
 if that man had not been born. ","But Judas that betrayed him
 answered
 saying
 Master
 whether I am he? Jesus said to him
 Thou hast said. [Forsooth Judas that betrayed him
 answered
 saying
 Master
 whether it am I? He said to him
 Thou hast said.] ","And while they supped [Forsooth them supping]
 Jesus took bread
 and blessed [it]
 and brake
 and gave to his disciples
 and said
 Take ye
 and eat; this is my body. ","And he took the cup
 and did thankings
 and gave to them
 and said [saying]
 Drink ye all thereof; ","this is my blood of the new testament
 which shall be shed for many
 into remission of sins. ","And I say to you
 I shall not drink from this time
 of this fruit of the vine
 [till] into that day when I shall drink it new with you
 in the kingdom of my Father. ","Then Jesus said to them
 All ye shall suffer cause of stumbling in me
 in this night [Then Jesus saith to them
 All ye shall suffer offence in me
 this night]; for it is written
 I shall smite the shepherd
 and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered. ","But after that I shall rise again
 I shall go before you into Galilee. ","Jesus said to him
 Truly I say to thee
 for in this night before the cock crow
 thrice thou shalt deny me. ","Then Jesus came with them into a town
 that is said Gethsemane. And he said to his disciples
 Sit ye here
 while I go thither
 and pray. ","Then he said to them
 My soul is sorrowful [till] to the death; abide ye here
 and wake ye with me. [Then he saith to them
 My soul is sorrowful till to the death; sustain ye
 or abide ye
 here
 and wake ye with me.] ","And he went forth a little
 and felled down [fell down] on his face
 praying
 and saying
 My Father
 if it is possible
 pass this cup from me [praying
 and saying
 My Father
 if it is possible
 this cup pass from me]; nevertheless not as I will
 but as thou wilt. ","And he came to his disciples
 and found them sleeping. And he said to Peter
 So
 whether ye might not one hour wake with me[d]? ","Wake ye
 and pray ye
 that ye enter not into temptation; for the spirit is ready
 but the flesh is frail.[e] ","Again the second time he went
 and prayed
 saying
 My Father
 if this cup may not pass
 but I drink it
 thy will be done. ","Then he came to his disciples
 and said to them
 Sleep ye now
 and rest ye; lo! the hour hath approached
 and man's Son shall be betaken into the hands of sinners;[f] ","rise ye
 go we; lo! he that shall take me
 is nigh. [rise ye
 go we; lo! he that shall betray me
 hath nighed.]","And Jesus said to him
 Friend
 whereto art thou come? Then they came nigh
 and laid hands on Jesus
 and held him. ","Then Jesus said to him
 Turn thy sword into his place; for all that take sword
 shall perish by sword. ","Whether guessest thou
 that I may not pray my Father
 and he shall give to me now more than twelve legions of angels? ","How then shall the scriptures be fulfilled? for so it behooveth to be done.","In that hour Jesus said to the people
 As to a thief ye have gone out
 with swords and bats
 [for] to take me; day by day I sat among you
 and taught in the temple
 and ye held me not.[h] ","But all this thing was done
 that the scriptures of prophets should be fulfilled. Then all the disciples fled
 and left him [Then all the disciples fled
 him forsaken]. ","Jesus said to him
 Thou hast said; nevertheless I say to you
 hereafter ye shall see man's Son sitting at the right half of the virtue of God [nevertheless
 I say to you
 from henceforth
 ye shall see man's Son sitting at the right half of God's virtue]
 and coming in the clouds of heaven. ","And Peter bethought on the word of Jesus
 that he had said
 Before the cock crow
 thrice thou shalt deny me. And he went out
 and wept bitterly.","And Jesus stood before the doomsman; and the justice asked him
 and said [and the president asked him
 saying]
 Art thou king of Jews? Jesus saith to him
 Thou sayest. ","And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a great voice
 and said [saying]
 Eli
 Eli
 lama sabachthani
 that is
 My God
 my God
 why hast thou forsaken me? ","And lo! Jesus met them
 and said [saying]
 Hail ye. And they approached[b]
 and held his feet
 and worshipped him. ","Then Jesus said to them
 Do not ye dread; go ye
 tell ye to my brethren
 that they go into Galilee; there they shall see me. ","And Jesus came nigh
 and spake to them
 and said
 All power in heaven and in earth is given to me. [And Jesus coming to
 spake to them
 saying
 All power is given to me
 in heaven and in earth.] ","Therefore go ye
 and teach all folks
 baptizing them in the name of the Father
 and of the Son
 and of the Holy Ghost; ","teaching them to keep all things
 whatever things I have commanded to you; and lo! I am with you in all days
 into the end of the world.[c]"
