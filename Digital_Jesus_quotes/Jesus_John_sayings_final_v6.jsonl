"And they asked him
 What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith
 I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered
 No. ","Then said they unto him
 Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself? ","He said
 I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness
 Make straight the way of the Lord
 as said the prophet Esaias.","Then Jesus turned
 and saw them following
 and saith unto them
 What seek ye? They said unto him
 Rabbi
 (which is to say
 being interpreted
 Master
) where dwellest thou? ","He saith unto them
 Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt
 and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour. ","And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him
 he said
 Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas
 which is by interpretation
 A stone.","The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee
 and findeth Philip
 and saith unto him
 Follow me. ","Philip findeth Nathanael
 and saith unto him
 We have found him
 of whom Moses in the law
 and the prophets
 did write
 Jesus of Nazareth
 the son of Joseph. ","And Nathanael said unto him
 Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him
 Come and see. ","Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him
 and saith of him
 Behold an Israelite indeed
 in whom is no guile! ","Nathanael saith unto him
 Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him
 Before that Philip called thee
 when thou wast under the fig tree
 I saw thee. ","Jesus answered and said unto him
 Because I said unto thee
 I saw thee under the fig tree
 believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these. ","And he saith unto him
 Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 Hereafter ye shall see heaven open
 and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.","Jesus saith unto her
 Woman
 what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come. ","Jesus saith unto them
 Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim. ","And he saith unto them
 Draw out now
 and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it. ","and said unto them that sold doves
 Take these things hence; make not my Father\u2019s house an house of merchandise. ","Jesus answered and said unto them
 Destroy this temple
 and in three days I will raise it up. ","Jesus answered and said unto him
 Verily
 verily
 I say unto thee
 Except a man be born again
 he cannot see the kingdom of God. ","Jesus answered
 Verily
 verily
 I say unto thee
 Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit
 he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. ","That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.","Marvel not that I said unto thee
 Ye must be born again. ","The wind bloweth where it listeth
 and thou hearest the sound thereof
 but canst not tell whence it cometh
 and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.","Jesus answered and said unto him
 Art thou a master of Israel
 and knowest not these things? ","Verily
 verily
 I say unto thee
 We speak that we do know
 and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness. ","If I have told you earthly things
 and ye believe not
 how shall ye believe
 if I tell you of heavenly things? ","And no man hath ascended up to heaven
 but he that came down from heaven
 even the Son of man which is in heaven. ","And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness
 even so must the Son of man be lifted up: ","that whosoever believeth in him should not perish
 but have eternal life. ","For God so loved the world
 that he gave his only begotten Son
 that whosoever believeth in him should not perish
 but have everlasting life. ","For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.","He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already
 because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. ","And this is the condemnation
 that light is come into the world
 and men loved darkness rather than light
 because their deeds were evil. ","For every one that doeth evil hateth the light
 neither cometh to the light
 lest his deeds should be reproved. ","But he that doeth truth cometh to the light
 that his deeds may be made manifest
 that they are wrought in God.","And they came unto John
 and said unto him
 Rabbi
 he that was with thee beyond Jordan
 to whom thou barest witness
 behold
 the same baptizeth
 and all men come to him. ","There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her
 Give me to drink. ","Jesus answered and said unto her
 If thou knewest the gift of God
 and who it is that saith to thee
 Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him
 and he would have given thee living water. ","Jesus answered and said unto her
 Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: ","but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.","The woman saith unto him
 Sir
 give me this water
 that I thirst not
 neither come hither to draw. ","Jesus saith unto her
 Go
 call thy husband
 and come hither. ","The woman answered and said
 I have no husband. Jesus said unto her
 Thou hast well said
 I have no husband: ","for thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.","Jesus saith unto her
 Woman
 believe me
 the hour cometh
 when ye shall neither in this mountain
 nor yet at Jerusalem
 worship the Father. ","Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.","But the hour cometh
 and now is
 when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him. ","God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.","Jesus saith unto her
 I that speak unto thee am he.","But he said unto them
 I have meat to eat that ye know not of. ","Jesus saith unto them
 My meat is to do the will of him that sent me
 and to finish his work. ","Say not ye
 There are yet four months
 and then cometh harvest? behold
 I say unto you
 Lift up your eyes
 and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest. ","And he that reapeth receiveth wages
 and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together. ","And herein is that saying true
 One soweth
 and another reapeth. ","I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured
 and ye are entered into their labours.","and said unto the woman
 Now we believe
 not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves
 and know that this is indeed the Christ
 the Saviour of the world.","Then said Jesus unto him
 Except ye see signs and wonders
 ye will not believe. ","Jesus saith unto him
 Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him
 and he went his way. ","Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him
 Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him. ","So the father knew that it was at the same hour
 in the which Jesus said unto him
 Thy son liveth: and himself believed
 and his whole house. ","When Jesus saw him lie
 and knew that he had been now a long time in that case
 he saith unto him
 Wilt thou be made whole? ","Jesus saith unto him
 Rise
 take up thy bed
 and walk. ","He answered them
 He that made me whole
 the same said unto me
 Take up thy bed
 and walk. ","Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple
 and said unto him
 Behold
 thou art made whole: sin no more
 lest a worse thing come unto thee. ","But Jesus answered them
 My Father worketh hitherto
 and I work. ","Then answered Jesus and said unto them
 Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 The Son can do nothing of himself
 but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth
 these also doeth the Son likewise. ","For the Father loveth the Son
 and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these
 that ye may marvel. ","For as the Father raiseth up the dead
 and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will. ","For the Father judgeth no man
 but hath committed all judgment unto the Son: ","that all men should honour the Son
 even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him. ","Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 He that heareth my word
 and believeth on him that sent me
 hath everlasting life
 and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life. ","Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 The hour is coming
 and now is
 when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live. ","For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;","and hath given him authority to execute judgment also
 because he is the Son of man. ","Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming
 in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice
 ","and shall come forth; they that have done good
 unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil
 unto the resurrection of damnation. ","I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear
 I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will
 but the will of the Father which hath sent me.","If I bear witness of myself
 my witness is not true. ","There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.","Ye sent unto John
 and he bare witness unto the truth. ","But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say
 that ye might be saved. ","He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.","But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish
 the same works that I do
 bear witness of me
 that the Father hath sent me. ","And the Father himself
 which hath sent me
 hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time
 nor seen his shape. ","And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent
 him ye believe not. ","Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.","And ye will not come to me
 that ye might have life. ","I receive not honour from men.","But I know you
 that ye have not the love of God in you. ","I am come in my Father\u2019s name
 and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name
 him ye will receive. ","How can ye believe
 which receive honour one of another
 and seek not the honour that cometh from God only? ","Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you
 even Moses
 in whom ye trust. ","For had ye believed Moses
 ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me. ","But if ye believe not his writings
 how shall ye believe my words?","When Jesus then lifted up his eyes
 and saw a great company come unto him
 he saith unto Philip
 Whence shall we buy bread
 that these may eat? ","And Jesus said
 Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down
 in number about five thousand. ","When they were filled
 he said unto his disciples
 Gather up the fragments that remain
 that nothing be lost. ","But he saith unto them
 It is I; be not afraid. ","Jesus answered them and said
 Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 Ye seek me
 not because ye saw the miracles
 but because ye did eat of the loaves
 and were filled. ","Labour not for the meat which perisheth
 but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life
 which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed. ","Jesus answered and said unto them
 This is the work of God
 that ye believe on him whom he hath sent. ","Then Jesus said unto them
 Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven. ","For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven
 and giveth life unto the world. ","And Jesus said unto them
 I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst. ","But I said unto you
 That ye also have seen me
 and believe not. ","All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.","For I came down from heaven
 not to do mine own will
 but the will of him that sent me. ","And this is the Father\u2019s will which hath sent me
 that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing
 but should raise it up again at the last day. ","And this is the will of him that sent me
 that every one which seeth the Son
 and believeth on him
 may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.","Jesus therefore answered and said unto them
 Murmur not among yourselves. ","No man can come to me
 except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day. ","It is written in the prophets
 And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard
 and hath learned of the Father
 cometh unto me. ","Not that any man hath seen the Father
 save he which is of God
 he hath seen the Father. ","Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 He that believeth on me hath everlasting life. ","I am that bread of life.","Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness
 and are dead. ","This is the bread which cometh down from heaven
 that a man may eat thereof
 and not die. ","I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread
 he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh
 which I will give for the life of the world.","Then Jesus said unto them
 Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man
 and drink his blood
 ye have no life in you. ","Whoso eateth my flesh
 and drinketh my blood
 hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day. ","For my flesh is meat indeed
 and my blood is drink indeed. ","He that eateth my flesh
 and drinketh my blood
 dwelleth in me
 and I in him. ","As the living Father hath sent me
 and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me
 even he shall live by me. ","This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna
 and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever.","When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it
 he said unto them
 Doth this offend you? ","What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?","It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you
 they are spirit
 and they are life. ","But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not
 and who should betray him. ","And he said
 Therefore said I unto you
 that no man can come unto me
 except it were given unto him of my Father.","Then said Jesus unto the twelve
 Will ye also go away? ","Jesus answered them
 Have not I chosen you twelve
 and one of you is a devil? ","His brethren therefore said unto him
 Depart hence
 and go into Jud\u00e6a
 that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest. ","Then Jesus said unto them
 My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready. ","The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth
 because I testify of it
 that the works thereof are evil. ","Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast; for my time is not yet full come.","Jesus answered them
 and said
 My doctrine is not mine
 but his that sent me. ","If any man will do his will
 he shall know of the doctrine
 whether it be of God
 or whether I speak of myself. ","He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him
 the same is true
 and no unrighteousness is in him.","Did not Moses give you the law
 and yet none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me? ","Jesus answered and said unto them
 I have done one work
 and ye all marvel. ","Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses
 but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man. ","If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision
 that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me
 because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day? ","Judge not according to the appearance
 but judge righteous judgment.","Then said some of them of Jerusalem
 Is not this he
 whom they seek to kill? ","Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught
 saying
 Ye both know me
 and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself
 but he that sent me is true
 whom ye know not. ","But I know him: for I am from him
 and he hath sent me. ","Then said Jesus unto them
 Yet a little while am I with you
 and then I go unto him that sent me. ","Ye shall seek me
 and shall not find me: and where I am
 thither ye cannot come. ","Then said the Jews among themselves
 Whither will he go
 that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles
 and teach the Gentiles? ","In the last day
 that great day of the feast
 Jesus stood and cried
 saying
 If any man thirst
 let him come unto me
 and drink. ","He that believeth on me
 as the scripture hath said
 out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. ","(But this spake he of the Spirit
 which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)","they say unto him
 Master
 this woman was taken in adultery
 in the very act. ","So when they continued asking him
 he lifted up himself
 and said unto them
 He that is without sin among you
 let him first cast a stone at her. ","When Jesus had lifted up himself
 and saw none but the woman
 he said unto her
 Woman
 where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee? ","She said
 No man
 Lord. And Jesus said unto her
 Neither do I condemn thee: go
 and sin no more.","Then spake Jesus again unto them
 saying
 I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness
 but shall have the light of life. ","Jesus answered and said unto them
 Though I bear record of myself
 yet my record is true: for I know whence I came
 and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come
 and whither I go. ","Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.","And yet if I judge
 my judgment is true: for I am not alone
 but I and the Father that sent me. ","It is also written in your law
 that the testimony of two men is true. ","I am one that bear witness of myself
 and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me. ","Then said they unto him
 Where is thy Father? Jesus answered
 Ye neither know me
 nor my Father: if ye had known me
 ye should have known my Father also. ","Then said Jesus again unto them
 I go my way
 and ye shall seek me
 and shall die in your sins: whither I go
 ye cannot come. ","And he said unto them
 Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world. ","I said therefore unto you
 that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he
 ye shall die in your sins. ","Then said they unto him
 Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them
 Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning. ","I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.","Then said Jesus unto them
 When ye have lifted up the Son of man
 then shall ye know that I am he
 and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me
 I speak these things. ","And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.","Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him
 If ye continue in my word
 then are ye my disciples indeed; ","and ye shall know the truth
 and the truth shall make you free. ","Jesus answered them
 Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin. ","And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son abideth ever.","If the Son therefore shall make you free
 ye shall be free indeed. ","I know that ye are Abraham\u2019s seed; but ye seek to kill me
 because my word hath no place in you. ","I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.","They answered and said unto him
 Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them
 If ye were Abraham\u2019s children
 ye would do the works of Abraham. ","But now ye seek to kill me
 a man that hath told you the truth
 which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham. ","Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him
 We be not born of fornication; we have one Father
 even God. ","Jesus said unto them
 If God were your Father
 ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself
 but he sent me. ","Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word.","Ye are of your father the devil
 and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning
 and abode not in the truth
 because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie
 he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar
 and the father of it. ","And because I tell you the truth
 ye believe me not. ","Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth
 why do ye not believe me? ","He that is of God heareth God\u2019s words: ye therefore hear them not
 because ye are not of God.","Jesus answered
 I have not a devil; but I honour my Father
 and ye do dishonour me. ","And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.","Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 If a man keep my saying
 he shall never see death.","Then said the Jews unto him
 Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead
 and the prophets; and thou sayest
 If a man keep my saying
 he shall never taste of death. ","Jesus answered
 If I honour myself
 my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say
 that he is your God: ","yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say
 I know him not
 I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him
 and keep his saying. ","Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it
 and was glad. ","Jesus said unto them
 Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 Before Abraham was
 I am.","Jesus answered
 Neither hath this man sinned
 nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him. ","I must work the works of him that sent me
 while it is day: the night cometh
 when no man can work. ","As long as I am in the world
 I am the light of the world. ","and said unto him
 Go
 wash in the pool of Siloam
 (which is by interpretation
 Sent.) He went his way therefore
 and washed
 and came seeing.","He answered and said
 A man that is called Jesus made clay
 and anointed mine eyes
 and said unto me
 Go to the pool of Siloam
 and wash: and I went and washed
 and I received sight. ","Then said they unto him
 Where is he? He said
 I know not.","Then again called they the man that was blind
 and said unto him
 Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner. ","He answered and said
 Whether he be a sinner or no
 I know not: one thing I know
 that
 whereas I was blind
 now I see. ","Then said they to him again
 What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes? ","He answered them
 I have told you already
 and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples? ","Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him
 he said unto him
 Dost thou believe on the Son of God? ","And Jesus said unto him
 Thou hast both seen him
 and it is he that talketh with thee. ","And Jesus said
 For judgment I am come into this world
 that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind. ","Jesus said unto them
 If ye were blind
 ye should have no sin: but now ye say
 We see; therefore your sin remaineth.","Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold
 but climbeth up some other way
 the same is a thief and a robber. ","But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.","To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name
 and leadeth them out. ","And when he putteth forth his own sheep
 he goeth before them
 and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice. ","And a stranger will they not follow
 but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.","Then said Jesus unto them again
 Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 I am the door of the sheep. ","All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.","I am the door: by me if any man enter in
 he shall be saved
 and shall go in and out
 and find pasture. ","The thief cometh not
 but for to steal
 and to kill
 and to destroy: I am come that they might have life
 and that they might have it more abundantly. ","I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.","But he that is an hireling
 and not the shepherd
 whose own the sheep are not
 seeth the wolf coming
 and leaveth the sheep
 and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them
 and scattereth the sheep. ","The hireling fleeth
 because he is an hireling
 and careth not for the sheep. ","I am the good shepherd
 and know my sheep
 and am known of mine. ","As the Father knoweth me
 even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep. ","And other sheep I have
 which are not of this fold: them also I must bring
 and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold
 and one shepherd. ","Therefore doth my Father love me
 because I lay down my life
 that I might take it again. ","No man taketh it from me
 but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down
 and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.","Jesus answered them
 I told you
 and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father\u2019s name
 they bear witness of me. ","But ye believe not
 because ye are not of my sheep
 as I said unto you. ","My sheep hear my voice
 and I know them
 and they follow me: ","and I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish
 neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. ","My Father
 which gave them me
 is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father\u2019s hand. ","I and my Father are one.","Jesus answered them
 Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me? ","Jesus answered them
 Is it not written in your law
 I said
 Ye are gods? ","If he called them gods
 unto whom the word of God came
 and the scripture cannot be broken; ","say ye of him
 whom the Father hath sanctified
 and sent into the world
 Thou blasphemest; because I said
 I am the Son of God? ","If I do not the works of my Father
 believe me not. ","But if I do
 though ye believe not me
 believe the works: that ye may know
 and believe
 that the Father is in me
 and I in him.","When Jesus heard that
 he said
 This sickness is not unto death
 but for the glory of God
 that the Son of God might be glorified thereby. ","Then after that saith he to his disciples
 Let us go into Jud\u00e6a again. ","Jesus answered
 Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day
 he stumbleth not
 because he seeth the light of this world. ","But if a man walk in the night
 he stumbleth
 because there is no light in him. ","These things said he: and after that he saith unto them
 Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go
 that I may awake him out of sleep. ","Then said Jesus unto them plainly
 Lazarus is dead. ","And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there
 to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him. ","Then said Thomas
 which is called Didymus
 unto his fellowdisciples
 Let us also go
 that we may die with him.","Jesus saith unto her
 Thy brother shall rise again. ","Jesus said unto her
 I am the resurrection
 and the life: he that believeth in me
 though he were dead
 yet shall he live: ","and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?","She saith unto him
 Yea
 Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ
 the Son of God
 which should come into the world.","Then when Mary was come where Jesus was
 and saw him
 she fell down at his feet
 saying unto him
 Lord
 if thou hadst been here
 my brother had not died. ","and said
 Where have ye laid him? They said unto him
 Lord
 come and see. ","Jesus said
 Take ye away the stone. Martha
 the sister of him that was dead
 saith unto him
 Lord
 by this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead four days. ","Jesus saith unto her
 Said I not unto thee
 that
 if thou wouldest believe
 thou shouldest see the glory of God? ","Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes
 and said
 Father
 I thank thee that thou hast heard me. ","And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it
 that they may believe that thou hast sent me. ","And when he thus had spoken
 he cried with a loud voice
 Lazarus
 come forth. ","And he that was dead came forth
 bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them
 Loose him
 and let him go.","Then said Jesus
 Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this. ","For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.","The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave
 and raised him from the dead
 bare record. ","The Pharisees therefore said among themselves
 Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold
 the world is gone after him.","the same came therefore to Philip
 which was of Bethsaida of Galilee
 and desired him
 saying
 Sir
 we would see Jesus. ","And Jesus answered them
 saying
 The hour is come
 that the Son of man should be glorified. ","Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die
 it abideth alone: but if it die
 it bringeth forth much fruit. ","He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.","If any man serve me
 let him follow me; and where I am
 there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me
 him will my Father honour.","Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father
 save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour. ","Father
 glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven
 saying
 I have both glorified it
 and will glorify it again. ","Jesus answered and said
 This voice came not because of me
 but for your sakes. ","Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.","And I
 if I be lifted up from the earth
 will draw all men unto me. ","Then Jesus said unto them
 Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light
 lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth. ","While ye have light
 believe in the light
 that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus
 and departed
 and did hide himself from them.","Jesus cried and said
 He that believeth on me
 believeth not on me
 but on him that sent me. ","And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.","I am come a light into the world
 that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness. ","And if any man hear my words
 and believe not
 I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world
 but to save the world. ","He that rejecteth me
 and receiveth not my words
 hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken
 the same shall judge him in the last day. ","For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me
 he gave me a commandment
 what I should say
 and what I should speak. ","And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore
 even as the Father said unto me
 so I speak.","Jesus answered and said unto him
 What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter. ","Peter saith unto him
 Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him
 If I wash thee not
 thou hast no part with me. ","Jesus saith to him
 He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet
 but is clean every whit: and ye are clean
 but not all. ","For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he
 Ye are not all clean.","So after he had washed their feet
 and had taken his garments
 and was set down again
 he said unto them
 Know ye what I have done to you? ","Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.","If I then
 your Lord and Master
 have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another\u2019s feet. ","For I have given you an example
 that ye should do as I have done to you. ","Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him. ","If ye know these things
 happy are ye if ye do them.","I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled
 He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me. ","Now I tell you before it come
 that
 when it is come to pass
 ye may believe that I am he. ","Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.","When Jesus had thus said
 he was troubled in spirit
 and testified
 and said
 Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 that one of you shall betray me. ","Jesus answered
 He it is
 to whom I shall give a sop
 when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop
 he gave it to Judas Iscariot
 the son of Simon. ","And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him
 That thou doest
 do quickly. ","Therefore
 when he was gone out
 Jesus said
 Now is the Son of man glorified
 and God is glorified in him. ","If God be glorified in him
 God shall also glorify him in himself
 and shall straightway glorify him. ","Little children
 yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews
 Whither I go
 ye cannot come; so now I say to you. ","A new commandment I give unto you
 That ye love one another; as I have loved you
 that ye also love one another. ","By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples
 if ye have love one to another.","Simon Peter said unto him
 Lord
 whither goest thou? Jesus answered him
 Whither I go
 thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards. ","Jesus answered him
 Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily
 verily
 I say unto thee
 The cock shall not crow
 till thou hast denied me thrice.","Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God
 believe also in me. ","In my Father\u2019s house are many mansions: if it were not so
 I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. ","And if I go and prepare a place for you
 I will come again
 and receive you unto myself; that where I am
 there ye may be also. ","And whither I go ye know
 and the way ye know.","Jesus saith unto him
 I am the way
 the truth
 and the life: no man cometh unto the Father
 but by me. ","If ye had known me
 ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him
 and have seen him.","Jesus saith unto him
 Have I been so long time with you
 and yet hast thou not known me
 Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then
 Shew us the Father? ","Believest thou not that I am in the Father
 and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me
 he doeth the works. ","Believe me that I am in the Father
 and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works\u2019 sake. ","Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 He that believeth on me
 the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father. ","And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name
 that will I do
 that the Father may be glorified in the Son. ","If ye shall ask any thing in my name
 I will do it.","If ye love me
 keep my commandments. ","And I will pray the Father
 and he shall give you another Comforter
 that he may abide with you for ever; ","even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive
 because it seeth him not
 neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you
 and shall be in you. ","I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.","Yet a little while
 and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live
 ye shall live also. ","At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father
 and ye in me
 and I in you. ","He that hath my commandments
 and keepeth them
 he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father
 and I will love him
 and will manifest myself to him.","Judas saith unto him
 not Iscariot
 Lord
 how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us
 and not unto the world? ","Jesus answered and said unto him
 If a man love me
 he will keep my words: and my Father will love him
 and we will come unto him
 and make our abode with him. ","He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine
 but the Father\u2019s which sent me. ","These things have I spoken unto you
 being yet present with you. ","But the Comforter
 which is the Holy Ghost
 whom the Father will send in my name
 he shall teach you all things
 and bring all things to your remembrance
 whatsoever I have said unto you.","Peace I leave with you
 my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth
 give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled
 neither let it be afraid. ","Ye have heard how I said unto you
 I go away
 and come again unto you. If ye loved me
 ye would rejoice
 because I said
 I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I. ","And now I have told you before it come to pass
 that
 when it is come to pass
 ye might believe. ","Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh
 and hath nothing in me. ","But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment
 even so I do. Arise
 let us go hence.","I am the true vine
 and my Father is the husbandman. ","Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit
 he purgeth it
 that it may bring forth more fruit. ","Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.","Abide in me
 and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself
 except it abide in the vine; no more can ye
 except ye abide in me. ","I am the vine
 ye are the branches: He that abideth in me
 and I in him
 the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing. ","If a man abide not in me
 he is cast forth as a branch
 and is withered; and men gather them
 and cast them into the fire
 and they are burned. ","If ye abide in me
 and my words abide in you
 ye shall ask what ye will
 and it shall be done unto you. ","Herein is my Father glorified
 that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples. ","As the Father hath loved me
 so have I loved you: continue ye in my love. ","If ye keep my commandments
 ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father\u2019s commandments
 and abide in his love. ","These things have I spoken unto you
 that my joy might remain in you
 and that your joy might be full. ","This is my commandment
 That ye love one another
 as I have loved you. ","Greater love hath no man than this
 that a man lay down his life for his friends. ","Ye are my friends
 if ye do whatsoever I command you. ","Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.","Ye have not chosen me
 but I have chosen you
 and ordained you
 that ye should go and bring forth fruit
 and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name
 he may give it you. ","These things I command you
 that ye love one another.","If the world hate you
 ye know that it hated me before it hated you. ","If ye were of the world
 the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world
 but I have chosen you out of the world
 therefore the world hateth you. ","Remember the word that I said unto you
 The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me
 they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying
 they will keep yours also. ","But all these things will they do unto you for my name\u2019s sake
 because they know not him that sent me. ","If I had not come and spoken unto them
 they had not had sin: but now they have no cloke for their sin. ","He that hateth me hateth my Father also.","If I had not done among them the works which none other man did
 they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father. ","But this cometh to pass
 that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law
 They hated me without a cause. ","But when the Comforter is come
 whom I will send unto you from the Father
 even the Spirit of truth
 which proceedeth from the Father
 he shall testify of me: ","and ye also shall bear witness
 because ye have been with me from the beginning.","These things have I spoken unto you
 that ye should not be offended. ","They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea
 the time cometh
 that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service. ","And these things will they do unto you
 because they have not known the Father
 nor me. ","But these things have I told you
 that when the time shall come
 ye may remember that I told you of them. And these things I said not unto you at the beginning
 because I was with you. ","But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me
 Whither goest thou? ","But because I have said these things unto you
 sorrow hath filled your heart. ","Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away
 the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart
 I will send him unto you. ","And when he is come
 he will reprove the world of sin
 and of righteousness
 and of judgment: ","of sin
 because they believe not on me; ","of righteousness
 because I go to my Father
 and ye see me no more; ","of judgment
 because the prince of this world is judged.","I have yet many things to say unto you
 but ye cannot bear them now. ","Howbeit when he
 the Spirit of truth
 is come
 he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear
 that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come. ","He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine
 and shall shew it unto you. ","All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I
 that he shall take of mine
 and shall shew it unto you. ","A little while
 and ye shall not see me: and again
 a little while
 and ye shall see me
 because I go to the Father.","Then said some of his disciples among themselves
 What is this that he saith unto us
 A little while
 and ye shall not see me: and again
 a little while
 and ye shall see me: and
 Because I go to the Father? ","They said therefore
 What is this that he saith
 A little while? we cannot tell what he saith.","Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him
 and said unto them
 Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said
 A little while
 and ye shall not see me: and again
 a little while
 and ye shall see me? ","Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 That ye shall weep and lament
 but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful
 but your sorrow shall be turned into joy. ","A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow
 because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child
 she remembereth no more the anguish
 for joy that a man is born into the world. ","And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again
 and your heart shall rejoice
 and your joy no man taketh from you. ","And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name
 he will give it you. ","Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask
 and ye shall receive
 that your joy may be full.","These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time cometh
 when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs
 but I shall shew you plainly of the Father. ","At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you
 that I will pray the Father for you: ","for the Father himself loveth you
 because ye have loved me
 and have believed that I came out from God. ","I came forth from the Father
 and am come into the world: again
 I leave the world
 and go to the Father.","Jesus answered them
 Do ye now believe? ","Behold
 the hour cometh
 yea
 is now come
 that ye shall be scattered
 every man to his own
 and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone
 because the Father is with me. ","These things I have spoken unto you
 that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.","These words spake Jesus
 and lifted up his eyes to heaven
 and said
 Father
 the hour is come; glorify thy Son
 that thy Son also may glorify thee: ","as thou hast given him power over all flesh
 that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him. ","And this is life eternal
 that they might know thee the only true God
 and Jesus Christ
 whom thou hast sent. ","I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.","And now
 O Father
 glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.","I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were
 and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thy word. ","Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee.","For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received them
 and have known surely that I came out from thee
 and they have believed that thou didst send me. ","I pray for them: I pray not for the world
 but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine. ","And all mine are thine
 and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them.","And now I am no more in the world
 but these are in the world
 and I come to thee. Holy Father
 keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me
 that they may be one
 as we are. ","While I was with them in the world
 I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept
 and none of them is lost
 but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.","And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world
 that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves. ","I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them
 because they are not of the world
 even as I am not of the world. ","I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world
 but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil. ","They are not of the world
 even as I am not of the world. ","Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.","As thou hast sent me into the world
 even so have I also sent them into the world. ","And for their sakes I sanctify myself
 that they also might be sanctified through the truth.","Neither pray I for these alone
 but for them also which shall believe on me through their word; ","that they all may be one; as thou
 Father
 art in me
 and I in thee
 that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me. ","And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one
 even as we are one: ","I in them
 and thou in me
 that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me
 and hast loved them
 as thou hast loved me.","Father
 I will that they also
 whom thou hast given me
 be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory
 which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world. ","O righteous Father
 the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee
 and these have known that thou hast sent me. ","And I have declared unto them thy name
 and will declare it: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them
 and I in them.","Jesus therefore
 knowing all things that should come upon him
 went forth
 and said unto them
 Whom seek ye? ","They answered him
 Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them
 I am he. And Judas also
 which betrayed him
 stood with them. ","As soon then as he had said unto them
 I am he
 they went backward
 and fell to the ground. ","Then asked he them again
 Whom seek ye? And they said
 Jesus of Nazareth. ","Jesus answered
 I have told you that I am he: if therefore ye seek me
 let these go their way: ","Then said Jesus unto Peter
 Put up thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me
 shall I not drink it?","Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter
 Art not thou also one of this man\u2019s disciples? He saith
 I am not. ","Jesus answered him
 I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue
 and in the temple
 whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing. ","Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me
 what I have said unto them: behold
 they know what I said. ","Jesus answered him
 If I have spoken evil
 bear witness of the evil: but if well
 why smitest thou me? ","Then said Pilate unto them
 Take ye him
 and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him
 It is not lawful for us to put any man to death: ","Jesus answered him
 Sayest thou this thing of thyself
 or did others tell it thee of me? ","Jesus answered
 My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world
 then would my servants fight
 that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence. ","Pilate therefore said unto him
 Art thou a king then? Jesus answered
 Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born
 and for this cause came I into the world
 that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice. ","Pilate therefore went forth again
 and saith unto them
 Behold
 I bring him forth to you
 that ye may know that I find no fault in him. ","Then came Jesus forth
 wearing the crown of thorns
 and the purple robe. And Pilate saith unto them
 Behold the man! ","When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him
 they cried out
 saying
 Crucify him
 crucify him. Pilate saith unto them
 Take ye him
 and crucify him: for I find no fault in him. ","Jesus answered
 Thou couldest have no power at all against me
 except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin.","And it was the preparation of the passover
 and about the sixth hour: and he saith unto the Jews
 Behold your King! ","When Jesus therefore saw his mother
 and the disciple standing by
 whom he loved
 he saith unto his mother
 Woman
 behold thy son! ","Then saith he to the disciple
 Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home.","After this
 Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished
 that the scripture might be fulfilled
 saith
 I thirst. ","When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar
 he said
 It is finished: and he bowed his head
 and gave up the ghost.","Then she runneth
 and cometh to Simon Peter
 and to the other disciple
 whom Jesus loved
 and saith unto them
 They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre
 and we know not where they have laid him. ","And they say unto her
 Woman
 why weepest thou? She saith unto them
 Because they have taken away my Lord
 and I know not where they have laid him.","Jesus saith unto her
 Woman
 why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She
 supposing him to be the gardener
 saith unto him
 Sir
 if thou have borne him hence
 tell me where thou hast laid him
 and I will take him away. ","Jesus saith unto her
 Mary. She turned herself
 and saith unto him
 Rabboni; which is to say
 Master. ","Jesus saith unto her
 Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren
 and say unto them
 I ascend unto my Father
 and your Father; and to my God
 and your God. ","Then the same day at evening
 being the first day of the week
 when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews
 came Jesus and stood in the midst
 and saith unto them
 Peace be unto you. ","Then said Jesus to them again
 Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me
 even so send I you. ","And when he had said this
 he breathed on them
 and saith unto them
 Receive ye the Holy Ghost: ","whose soever sins ye remit
 they are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain
 they are retained.","The other disciples therefore said unto him
 We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them
 Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails
 and put my finger into the print of the nails
 and thrust my hand into his side
 I will not believe.","And after eight days again his disciples were within
 and Thomas with them: then came Jesus
 the doors being shut
 and stood in the midst
 and said
 Peace be unto you. ","Then saith he to Thomas
 Reach hither thy finger
 and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand
 and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless
 but believing. ","Jesus saith unto him
 Thomas
 because thou hast seen me
 thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen
 and yet have believed.","Then Jesus saith unto them
 Children
 have ye any meat? They answered him
 No. ","Jesus saith unto them
 Bring of the fish which ye have now caught. ","Jesus saith unto them
 Come and dine. And none of the disciples durst ask him
 Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord. ","So when they had dined
 Jesus saith to Simon Peter
 Simon
 son of Jonas
 lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him
 Yea
 Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him
 Feed my lambs. ","He saith to him again the second time
 Simon
 son of Jonas
 lovest thou me? He saith unto him
 Yea
 Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him
 Feed my sheep. ","He saith unto him the third time
 Simon
 son of Jonas
 lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time
 Lovest thou me? And he said unto him
 Lord
 thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him
 Feed my sheep. ","Verily
 verily
 I say unto thee
 When thou wast young
 thou girdedst thyself
 and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old
 thou shalt stretch forth thy hands
 and another shall gird thee
 and carry thee whither thou wouldest not. ","This spake he
 signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this
 he saith unto him
 Follow me.","Jesus saith unto him
 If I will that he tarry till I come
 what is that to thee? follow thou me. ","Then went this saying abroad among the brethren
 that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him
 He shall not die; but
 If I will that he tarry till I come
 what is that to thee?","They asked him
 \u201cWhat then? Are you Elijah?\u201d And he said
 \u201cI am not.\u201d \u201cAre you the  Prophet?\u201d And he answered
 \u201cNo.\u201d ","Then they said to him
 \u201cWho are you? Tell us
 so that we may give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?\u201d ","He said
 \u201cI am the voice of one shouting in the wilderness
 \u2018Make straight the way of the Lord
\u2019 as the prophet Isaiah said.\u201d","And Jesus turned and saw them following Him
 and asked them
 \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d They answered Him
 \u201cRabbi (which translated means Teacher)
 where are You staying?\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cCome
 and you will see.\u201d So they went [with Him] and saw where He was staying; and they stayed with Him that day
 for it was about the tenth hour. ","Andrew brought Simon to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said
 \u201cYou are Simon the son of John. You shall be called Cephas (which is translated Peter).\u201d","The next day Jesus decided to go into Galilee
 and He found Philip and said to him
 \u201cFollow Me [as My disciple
 accepting Me as your Master and Teacher
 and walking the same path of life that I walk].\u201d ","Philip found Nathanael and told him
 \u201cWe have found the One Moses in the Law and also the Prophets wrote about\u2014Jesus from Nazareth
 the son of Joseph [according to public record].\u201d ","Nathanael answered him
 \u201cCan anything good come out of Nazareth?\u201d Philip replied
 \u201cCome and see.\u201d ","Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward Him
 and said of him
 \u201cHere is an Israelite indeed [a true descendant of Jacob]
 in whom there is no guile nor deceit nor duplicity!\u201d ","Nathanael said to Jesus
 \u201cHow do You know [these things about] me?\u201d Jesus answered
 \u201cBefore Philip called you
 when you were still under the fig tree
 I saw you.\u201d ","Jesus replied
 \u201cBecause I said to you that I saw you under the fig tree
 do you believe [in Me]? You will see greater things than this.\u201d ","Then He said to him
 \u201cI assure you and most solemnly say to you
 you will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man [the bridge between heaven and earth].\u201d","Jesus said to her
 \u201c woman
 what is that to you and to Me? My time [to act and to be revealed] has not yet come.\u201d ","Jesus said to the servants
 \u201cFill the waterpots with water.\u201d So they filled them up to the brim. ","Then He said to them
 \u201cDraw some out now and take it to the headwaiter [of the banquet].\u201d So they took it to him. ","then to those who sold the doves He said
 \u201cTake these things away! Stop making My Father\u2019s house a place of commerce!\u201d ","Jesus answered them
 \u201cDestroy this temple
 and in three days I will raise it up.\u201d ","Jesus answered him
 \u201cI assure you and most solemnly say to you
 unless a person is born again [reborn from above\u2014spiritually transformed
 renewed
 sanctified]
 he cannot  see and experience the kingdom of God.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cI assure you and most solemnly say to you
 unless one is born of water and the Spirit he cannot  enter the kingdom of God. ","That which is born of the flesh is flesh [the physical is merely physical]
 and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. ","Do not be surprised that I have told you
 \u2018You must be born again [reborn from above\u2014spiritually transformed
 renewed
 sanctified].\u2019 ","The wind blows where it wishes and you hear its sound
 but you do not know where it is coming from and where it is going; so it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cYou are the [great and well-known] teacher of Israel
 and yet you do not know nor understand these things [from Scripture]? ","I assure you and most solemnly say to you
 we speak only of what we  know and testify about what we have  seen [as eyewitnesses]; and  you [reject our evidence and] do not accept our testimony. ","If I told you earthly things [that is
 things that happen right here on earth] and you do not believe
 how will you believe and trust Me if I tell you heavenly things? ","No one has gone up into heaven
 but there is One who came down from heaven
 the Son of Man [Himself\u2014whose home is in heaven]. ","Just as Moses lifted up the  serpent in the desert [on a pole]
 so must the Son of Man be lifted up [on the cross]
 ","so that whoever believes will in Him have eternal life [after physical death
 and will actually live forever].","\u201cFor God so  loved and dearly prized the world
 that He  gave His [One and] only begotten Son
 so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish
 but have eternal life. ","For God did not send the Son into the world to judge and condemn the world [that is
 to initiate the final judgment of the world]

 there is no judgment
 no rejection
 no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced]
 because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique
 the only One of His kind
 the One who alone can save him]. ","This is the judgment [that is
 the cause for indictment
 the test by which people are judged
 the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world
 and people loved the darkness rather than the Light
 for their deeds were evil. ","For every wrongdoer hates the Light
 and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful
 worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned. ","But whoever practices truth [and does what is right\u2014morally
 ethically
 spiritually] comes to the Light
 so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are\u2014accomplished in God [divinely prompted
 done with God\u2019s help
 in dependence on Him].\u201d","So they came to John and said to him
 \u201cRabbi (Teacher)
 the Man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan [at the Jordan River crossing]\u2014and to whom you have testified\u2014look
 He is baptizing too
 and everyone is going to Him!\u201d ","Then a woman from Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her
 \u201cGive Me a drink\u201d\u2014 ","Jesus answered her
 \u201cIf you knew  God\u2019s gift [of eternal life]
 and who it is who says
 \u2018Give Me a drink
\u2019 you would have asked Him 
 and He would have given you living water (eternal life).\u201d ","Jesus answered her
 \u201cEveryone who drinks this water will be thirsty again. ","But whoever drinks the water that I give him will never be thirsty again. But the water that I give him will become in him a spring of water [satisfying his thirst for God] welling up [continually flowing
 bubbling within him] to eternal life.\u201d","The woman said to Him
 \u201cSir
 give me this water
 so that I will not get thirsty nor [have to continually] come all the way here to draw.\u201d ","At this
 Jesus said
 \u201cGo
 call your husband and come back.\u201d ","The woman answered
 \u201cI do not have a husband.\u201d Jesus said to her
 \u201cYou have correctly said
 \u2018I do not have a husband\u2019; ","for you have had five husbands
 and the man you are now living with is not your husband. You have said this truthfully.\u201d ","Jesus replied
 \u201cWoman
 believe Me
 a time is coming [when God\u2019s kingdom comes] when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem. ","You  do not know what you worship; we  do know what we worship
 for salvation is from the Jews. ","But a time is coming and is already here when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit [from the heart
 the inner self] and in truth; for the Father seeks such people to be His worshipers. ","God is spirit [the Source of life
 yet invisible to mankind]
 and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.\u201d ","Jesus said to her
 \u201cI who speak to you
 am He (the Messiah).\u201d","But He told them
 \u201cI have food to eat that you do not know about.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cMy food is to do the will of Him who sent Me and to completely finish His work. ","Do you not say
 \u2018It is still four months until the harvest comes?\u2019 Look
 I say to you
 raise your eyes and look at the fields and see
 they are white for harvest. ","Already the reaper is receiving his wages and he is gathering fruit for eternal life; so that he who plants and he who reaps may rejoice together.","For in this case the saying is true
 \u2018One  sows and another reaps.\u2019 ","I sent you to reap [a crop] for which you have not worked. Others have worked and you have been privileged to reap the results of their work.\u201d","and they told the woman
 \u201cWe no longer believe just because of what you said; for  we have heard Him for ourselves and know [with confident assurance] that this One is truly the Savior of  the world.\u201d","Then Jesus said to him
 \u201cUnless you  see  signs and wonders
 you  will not believe.\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cGo; your son lives!\u201d The man believed what Jesus said to him and started home. ","So he asked them at what time he began to get better. They said
 \u201cYesterday during the seventh hour the fever left him.\u201d ","Then the father realized that it was at that very hour when Jesus had said to him
 \u201cYour son lives\u201d; and he and his entire household believed and confidently trusted [in Him as Savior]. ","When Jesus noticed him lying there 
 knowing that he had been in that condition a long time
 He said to him
 \u201cDo you want to get well?\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cGet up; pick up your pallet and walk.\u201d ","He answered them
 \u201cThe Man who healed me and gave me back my strength was the One who said to me
 \u2018Pick up your pallet and walk.\u2019\u201d ","Afterward
 Jesus found him in the temple and said to him
 \u201cSee
 you are well! Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you.\u201d ","But Jesus answered them
 \u201cMy Father has been working until now [He has never ceased working]
 and I too am working.\u201d","So Jesus answered them by saying
 \u201cI assure you and most solemnly say to you
 the Son can do nothing of Himself [of His own accord]
 unless it is something He sees the Father doing; for whatever things the Father does
 the Son [in His turn] also does in the same way. ","For the Father dearly loves the Son and shows Him everything that He Himself is doing; and the Father will show Him greater works than these
 so that you will be filled with wonder. ","Just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life [and allows them to live on]
 even so the Son also gives life to whom He wishes. ","For the Father judges no one
 but has given all judgment [that is
 the prerogative of judging] to the Son [placing it entirely into His hands]
 ","so that all will give honor (reverence
 homage) to the Son just as they give honor to the Father. [In fact] the one who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who has sent Him.","\u201cI assure you and most solemnly say to you
 the person who hears My word [the one who heeds My message]
 and believes and trusts in Him who sent Me
 has (possesses now) eternal life [that is
 eternal life actually begins\u2014the believer is transformed]
 and does not come into judgment and condemnation
 but has passed  from death into life.","I assure you and most solemnly say to you
 a time is coming and is  now
 when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God
 and those who hear it will live. ","For just as the Father has life in Himself [and is self-existent]
 even so He has given to the Son to have life in Himself [and be self-existent]. ","And He has given Him authority to execute judgment
 because He is a Son of Man [sinless humanity
 qualifying Him to sit in judgment over mankind]. ","Do not be surprised at this; for a time is coming when all those who are in the tombs will hear His voice
 ","and they will come out\u2014those who did good things [will come out] to a resurrection of  life
 but those who did evil things [will come out] to a resurrection of judgment [that is
 to be sentenced].","\u201cI can do nothing on my own initiative or authority. Just as I hear
 I judge; and My judgment is just (fair
 righteous
 unbiased)
 because I do not seek My own will
 but only the will of Him who sent Me.","\u201cIf I alone testify about Myself
 My testimony is not valid. ","There is another [My Father] who testifies about Me
 and I know [without any doubt] that His testimony on My behalf is true and valid.","You have sent [an inquiry] to John [the Baptist] and he has testified [as an eyewitness] to the truth.","But the testimony I receive is not from man [a merely human witness]; but I say these things so that you may be saved [that is
 have eternal life]. ","John was the lamp that kept on burning and shining [to show you the way]
 and you were willing for a while to rejoice in his light.","But the testimony which I have is far greater than the testimony of John; for the works that the Father has given Me to finish\u2014the very same works [that is
 the miracles and proofs of My deity] that I am  doing\u2014testify about Me
 [by providing evidence] that the Father has sent Me.","And the Father who sent Me has Himself testified about Me. You have never heard His voice nor seen His form [His majesty and greatness\u2014what He is like].","You do not have His word (Scripture) abiding in you [actually living in your hearts and minds]
 because you do not believe in Him whom He has sent.","You search and keep on searching and examining the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; and yet it is those [very Scriptures] that testify about Me;","and still you are unwilling to come to Me so that you may have life.","I do not receive glory and approval from men;","but I know you and recognize that you do not have the love of God in yourselves.","I have come in My Father\u2019s name and with His power
 and you do not receive Me [because your minds are closed]; but if another comes in his own name and with no authority or power except his own
 you will receive him and give your approval to an imposter. ","How can you believe [in Me]
 when you [seek and] receive glory and approval from one another
 and yet you do not seek the glory and approval which comes from the one and only God? ","Do not think that I [am the One who] will accuse you before the Father. There  is one who accuses you: Moses
 [the very one] in whom you have placed your hope [for salvation]. ","For if you believed and relied on [the Scriptures written by] Moses
 you would believe Me
 for he wrote about Me . ","But if you do not believe his writings
 how will you believe My words?\u201d","Jesus looked up and saw that a large crowd was coming toward Him
 and He said to Philip
 \u201cWhere will we buy bread for these people to eat?\u201d ","Jesus said
 \u201cHave the people sit down [to eat].\u201d Now [the ground] there was [covered with] an abundance of grass
 so the men sat down
 about 5
000 in number. ","When they had eaten enough
 He said to His disciples
 \u201cGather up the leftover pieces so that nothing will be lost.\u201d ","But Jesus said to them
 \u201cIt is I (I Am); do not be afraid.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cI assure you and most solemnly say to you
 you have been searching for Me
 not because you saw the signs (attesting miracles)
 but because you ate the loaves and were filled. ","Do not work for food that perishes
 but for food that endures [and leads] to eternal life
 which the Son of Man will give you; for God the Father has authorized Him and put His seal on Him.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cThis is the work of God: that you believe [adhere to
 trust in
 rely on
 and have faith] in the One whom He has sent.\u201d ","Then Jesus said to them
 \u201cI assure you and most solemnly say to you
 it is not Moses who has given you the bread out of heaven
 but it is My Father who gives you the true bread out of heaven. ","For the Bread of God is He who comes down out of heaven
 and gives life to the world.\u201d ","Jesus replied to them
 \u201cI am the Bread of Life. The one who comes to Me will never be hungry
 and the one who believes in Me [as Savior] will never be thirsty [for that one will be sustained spiritually]. ","But as I told you
 you have seen Me and still you do not believe. ","All that My Father gives Me will come to Me; and the one who comes to Me I will most certainly not cast out [I will never
 never reject anyone who follows Me]. ","For I have come down from heaven
 not to do My own will
 but to do the will of Him who sent Me. ","This is the will of Him who sent Me
 that of all that He has given Me I lose nothing
 but that I [give new life and] raise it up at the last day. ","For this is My Father\u2019s will and purpose
 that everyone who sees the Son and believes in Him [as Savior] will have eternal life
 and I will raise him up [from the dead] on the last day.\u201d","So Jesus answered
 \u201cStop murmuring among yourselves. ","No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him [giving him the desire to come to Me]; and I will raise him up [from the dead] on the last day.","It is written in the prophets
 \u2018And they will all be taught of God.\u2019 Everyone who has listened to and learned from the Father
 comes to Me. ","Not that anyone has seen the Father
 except He [who was with the Father and] who is from God; He  has seen the Father. ","I assure you and most solemnly say to you
 he who believes [in Me as Savior\u2014whoever adheres to
 trusts in
 relies on
 and has faith in Me\u2014already] has eternal life [that is
 now possesses it]. ","I am the Bread of Life [the Living Bread which gives and sustains life].","Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness
 and they died. ","This is the Bread that comes down out of heaven
 so that one may eat of it and not die. ","I am the Living Bread that came down out of heaven. If anyone eats of this Bread [believes in Me
 accepts Me as Savior]
 he will live forever. And the Bread that I will give for the life of the world is My flesh (body).\u201d","And Jesus said to them
 \u201cI assure you and most solemnly say to you
 unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood [unless you believe in Me as Savior and believe in the saving power of My blood which will be shed for you]
 you do not have life in yourselves. ","The one who eats My flesh and drinks My blood [believes in Me
 accepts Me as Savior] has eternal life [that is
 now possesses it]
 and I will raise him up [from the dead] on the last day. ","For My flesh is true  food
 and My blood is true  drink. ","He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood [believes in Me
 accepts Me as Savior] remains in Me
 and I [in the same way remain] in him. ","Just as the living Father sent Me
 and I live because of the Father
 even so the one who feeds on Me [believes in Me
 accepts Me as Savior] will also live because of Me. ","This is the Bread which came down out of heaven. It is not like [the manna that] our fathers ate and they  died; the one who eats this Bread [believes in Me
 accepts Me as Savior] will live forever.\u201d","But Jesus
 aware that His disciples were complaining about it
 asked them
 \u201cDoes this cause you to stumble and take offense? ","What then [will you think] if you see the Son of Man ascending to [the realm] where He was before?","It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh conveys no benefit [it is of no account]. The words I have spoken to you are spirit and life [providing eternal life].","But  there are some of you who do not believe and have faith.\u201d For Jesus knew from the beginning who did not believe
 and who would betray Him. ","And He was saying
 \u201cThis is the reason why I have told you that no one can come to Me unless it has been granted him [that is
 unless he is enabled to do so] by the Father.\u201d","So Jesus said to the twelve 
 \u201cYou do not want to leave too
 do you?\u201d ","Jesus answered them
 \u201cDid I not choose you
 the twelve ? And yet one of you is a devil (ally of Satan).\u201d ","So His brothers said to Him
 \u201cLeave here and go to Judea
 so that Your disciples  may also see the works that You do. ","So Jesus said to them
 \u201cMy time has not yet come; but any time is right for you. ","The world cannot hate you [since you are part of it]
 but it does hate Me because I denounce it and testify that its deeds are evil. ","Go up to the feast yourselves. I am not going up to this feast because My time has not yet fully come.\u201d","Jesus answered them by saying
 \u201cMy teaching is not My own
 but His who sent Me. ","If anyone is willing to do His will
 he will know whether the teaching is of God or whether I speak on My own accord and by My own authority. ","He who speaks on his own accord seeks glory and honor for himself. But He who seeks the glory and the honor of the One who sent Him
 He is true
 and there is no unrighteousness or deception in Him.","\u201cDid not Moses give you the Law? And yet not one of you keeps the Law. Why do you want to kill Me [for not keeping it]?\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cI did one work
 and you are all astounded. ","For this reason Moses has given you [God\u2019s law regarding] circumcision (not that it originated with Moses
 but with the patriarchs) and you circumcise a man  on the Sabbath. ","If
 to avoid breaking the Law of Moses
 a man undergoes circumcision on the Sabbath
 why are you angry with Me for making a man\u2019s whole body well on the Sabbath? ","Do not judge by appearance [superficially and arrogantly]
 but judge fairly and righteously.\u201d","Then some of the people of Jerusalem said
 \u201cIs this not the Man they want to kill? ","Then Jesus called out as He taught in the temple
 \u201cYou know Me and know where I am from; and I have not come on my own initiative [as self-appointed]
 but He who sent Me is true
 and Him you do not know. ","I know Him Myself because I am from Him [I came from His very presence] and it was He  who sent Me.\u201d","Therefore Jesus said
 \u201cFor a little while longer I am  with you
 and then I go to Him who sent Me. ","You will look for Me
 and will not [be able to] find Me; and where I am
 you cannot come.\u201d ","Then the Jews said among themselves
 \u201cWhere does this Man intend to go that we will not find Him? Does He intend to go to the Dispersion [of Jews scattered and living] among the Greeks
 and teach the Greeks? ","Now on the last and most important day of the feast
 Jesus stood and called out [in a loud voice]
 \u201cIf anyone is thirsty
 let him come to Me and drink! ","He who believes in Me [who adheres to
 trusts in
 and relies on Me]
 as the Scripture has said
 \u2018From his innermost being will flow continually rivers of living water.\u2019\u201d ","But He was speaking of the  Spirit
 whom those who believed in Him [as Savior] were to receive afterward. The Spirit had not yet been given
 because Jesus was not yet glorified (raised to honor).","and they said to Him
 \u201cTeacher
 this woman has been caught in the very act of adultery. ","However
 when they persisted in questioning Him
 He straightened up and said
 \u201cHe who is without  sin among you
 let him be the first to throw a stone at her.\u201d ","Straightening up
 Jesus said to her
 \u201cWoman
 where are they? Did no one condemn you?\u201d ","She answered
 \u201cNo one
 Lord!\u201d And Jesus said
 \u201cI do not condemn you either. Go. From now on sin no more.\u201d]","Once more Jesus addressed the crowd. He said
 \u201cI am the Light of the world. He who follows Me will not walk in the darkness
 but will have the Light of life.\u201d ","Jesus replied
 \u201cEven if I do testify on My own behalf
 My testimony is valid
 because I know where I came from and where I am going; but you do not know where I come from or where I am going. ","You judge according to human standards [just by what you see]. I do not judge anyone.","But even if I do judge
 My judgment is true and My decision is right; for I am not alone [in making it]
 but I and the Father who sent Me [make the same judgment]. ","Even in your own law it is written that the testimony of two persons is true [valid and admissible].","I am One [of the Two] who testifies about Myself
 and My Father who sent Me testifies about Me.\u201d ","Then the Pharisees said to Him
 \u201cWhere is this Father of Yours?\u201d Jesus answered
 \u201cYou know neither Me nor My Father; if you knew Me
 you would know My Father also.\u201d ","Then He said again to them
 \u201cI am going away
 and you will look for Me
 and you will die [unforgiven and condemned] in your sin. Where I am going
 you cannot come.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cYou are from below
 I am from above; you are of this world
 I am not of this world. ","That is why I told you that you will die [unforgiven and condemned] in your sins; for if you do not believe that I am the One [I claim to be]
 you will die in your sins.\u201d ","So they said to Him
 \u201cWho are You ?\u201d Jesus replied
 \u201cWhat have I been saying to you from the beginning? ","I have many things to say and judge concerning you
 but He who sent Me is true; and I say to the world  the things that I have heard from Him.\u201d ","So Jesus said
 \u201cWhen you lift up the Son of Man [on the cross]
 you will know then [without any doubt] that I am He
 and that I do nothing on My own authority
 but I say these things just as My Father taught Me. ","And He who sent Me is  with Me; He has not left Me alone
 because I always do what pleases Him.\u201d ","So Jesus was saying to the Jews who had believed Him
 \u201cIf you abide in My word [continually obeying My teachings and living in accordance with them
 then] you are truly My disciples. ","And you will know the truth [regarding salvation]
 and the truth will set you free [from the penalty of sin].\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cI assure you and most solemnly say to you
 everyone who practices sin habitually is a slave of sin. ","Now the slave does not remain in a household forever; the son [of the master] does remain forever.","So if the Son makes you free
 then you are unquestionably free. ","I know that you are Abraham\u2019s descendants; yet you plan to kill Me
 because My word has no place [to grow] in you [and it makes no change in your heart]. ","I tell the things that I have seen at My Father\u2019s side [in His very presence]; so you also do the things that you heard from your father.\u201d","They answered
 \u201cAbraham is our father.\u201d Jesus said to them
 \u201cIf you are  Abraham\u2019s children
 then do the works of Abraham and follow his example. ","But as it is
 you want to kill Me
 a Man who has told you the truth
 which I heard from God. This is not the way Abraham acted. ","You are doing the works of your  father.\u201d They said to Him
 \u201cWe are not illegitimate children; we have one  Father: God.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cIf God were your Father [but He is not]
 you would love and recognize Me
 for I came from God [out of His very presence] and have arrived here. For I have not even come on My own initiative [as self-appointed]
 but He [is the One who] sent Me. ","Why do you misunderstand what I am saying? It is because [your spiritual ears are deaf and] you are unable to hear [the truth of] My word.","You are of your father the devil
 and it is your will to practice the desires [which are characteristic] of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning
 and does not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him. When he lies
 he speaks what is natural to him
 for he is a liar and the father of lies and half-truths. ","But because I speak the truth
 you do not believe Me [and continue in your unbelief]. ","Which one of you [has proof and] convicts Me of sin? If I speak truth
 why do you not believe Me? ","Whoever is of God and belongs to Him hears [the truth of] God\u2019s words; for this reason you do not hear them: because you are not of God and you are not in fellowship with Him.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cI do not have a demon. On the contrary
 I honor My Father
 and you dishonor Me. ","However
 I am not seeking glory for Myself. There is One who seeks [glory for Me] and judges [those who dishonor Me]. ","I assure you and most solemnly say to you
 if anyone keeps My word [by living in accordance with My message] he will indeed never
 ever see and experience death.\u201d ","The Jews said to Him
 \u201cNow we know that You have a demon [and are under its power]. Abraham died
 and also the prophets; yet You say
 \u2018If anyone keeps My word
 he will never
 ever taste of death.\u2019 ","Jesus answered
 \u201cIf I glorify Myself
 My glory is  nothing. It is My Father who glorifies Me
 of whom you say
 \u2018He is our God.\u2019 ","Yet you do not know Him
 but I know Him fully. If I said I did not know Him
 I would be a liar like you. But I do know Him and keep His word. ","Your father Abraham  rejoiced to see My day (My incarnation). He saw it and was delighted.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cI assure you and most solemnly say to you
 before Abraham was born
 I Am.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cNeither this man nor his parents sinned
 but it was so that the works of God might be displayed and illustrated in him. ","We must work the works of Him who sent Me while it is day; night is coming when no one can work.","As long as I am in the world
 I am the Light of the world [giving guidance through My word and works].\u201d ","And He said to him
 \u201cGo
 wash in the pool of Siloam\u201d (which is translated
 Sent). So he went away and washed
 and came back seeing. ","He replied
 \u201cThe Man called Jesus made mud and smeared it on my eyes and told me
 \u2018Go to Siloam and wash.\u2019 So I went and washed
 and I received my sight!\u201d ","They asked him
 \u201cWhere is He?\u201d He said
 \u201cI do not know.\u201d","So a second time they called the man who had been  blind
 and said to him
 \u201cGive God glory and praise [for your sight]! We know this Man  is a sinner [separated from God].\u201d ","Then he answered
 \u201cI do not know whether He is a sinner [separated from God]; but one thing I do know
 that though I was blind
 now I see.\u201d ","So they said to him
 \u201cWhat did He  do to you? How did He open your eyes?\u201d ","He answered
 \u201cI already told you and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again and again? Do you want to become His disciples
 too?\u201d ","Jesus heard that they had put him out [of the synagogue]
 and finding him
 He asked
 \u201cDo you believe in the Son of Man?\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cYou have both seen Him
 and [in fact] He is the one who is talking with you.\u201d ","Then Jesus said
 \u201cI came into this world for judgment [to separate those who believe in Me from those who reject Me\u2014to declare judgment on those who choose to be separated from God]
 so that the sightless would see
 and those who see would become blind.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cIf you were blind [to spiritual things]
 you would have no sin [and would not be blamed for your unbelief]; but since you claim to have  sight
 [you have no excuse so] your sin and guilt remain.","\u201cI assure you and most solemnly say to you
 he who does not enter by the door into the sheepfold
 but climbs up from some other place [on the stone wall]
 that one is a thief and a robber. ","But he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep [the protector and provider].","The doorkeeper opens [the gate] for this man
 and the sheep hear his voice and pay attention to it. And [knowing that they listen] he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out [to pasture]. ","When he has brought all his own sheep outside
 he walks on ahead of them
 and the sheep follow him because they know his voice and recognize his call. ","They will never follow a stranger
 but will run away from him
 because they do not know the voice of strangers.\u201d ","So Jesus said again
 \u201cI assure you and most solemnly say to you
 I am the Door for the sheep [leading to life]. ","All who came before Me [as false messiahs and self-appointed leaders] are thieves and robbers
 but the  sheep did not hear them. ","I am the Door; anyone who enters through Me will be saved [and will live forever]
 and will go in and out 
 and find pasture (spiritual security). ","The thief comes only in order to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have and enjoy life
 and have it in abundance [to the full
 till it overflows].","I am the Good Shepherd. The Good Shepherd lays down His  life for the sheep.","But the hired man [who merely serves for wages]
 who is neither the shepherd nor the owner of the sheep
 when he sees the wolf coming
 deserts the flock and runs away; and the wolf snatches the sheep and scatters them. ","The man runs because he is a hired hand [who serves only for wages] and is not concerned about the [safety of the] sheep.","I am the Good Shepherd
 and I know [without any doubt those who are] My own and My own know Me [and have a deep
 personal relationship with Me]\u2014 ","even as the Father knows Me and I know the Father\u2014and I lay down My [very own] life [sacrificing it] for the benefit of the sheep.","I have other sheep [beside these] that are not of this fold. I must bring those also
 and they will listen to My voice and pay attention to My call
 and they will become one flock with one Shepherd. ","For this reason the Father loves Me
 because I lay down My  life so that I may take it back. ","No one takes it away from Me
 but I lay it down voluntarily. I am authorized and have power to lay it down and to give it up
 and I am authorized and have power to take it back. This command I have received from My Father.\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cI have told you so
 yet you do not believe. The works that I do in My Father\u2019s name testify concerning Me [they are My credentials and the evidence declaring who I am]. ","But you do not believe Me [so you do not trust and follow Me] because you are not My sheep.","The sheep that are My own hear My voice and listen to Me; I know them
 and they follow Me. ","And I give them eternal life
 and they will never
 ever [by any means] perish; and no one will ever snatch them out of My hand. ","My Father
 who has given them to Me
 is greater and mightier than all; and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father\u2019s hand. ","I and the Father are One [in essence and nature].\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cI showed you many good works [and many acts of mercy] from the Father; for which of them are you stoning Me?\u201d ","Jesus answered them
 \u201cIs it not written in your Law
 \u2018I said
 you are gods [human judges representing God
 not divine beings]\u2019? ","If He called them gods
 men to whom the word of God came (and the Scripture cannot be undone or annulled or broken)
 ","[if that is true] then do you say of Him whom the Father sanctified and set apart for Himself and sent into the world
 \u2018You are blaspheming
\u2019 because I said
 \u2018I am the Son of God\u2019? ","If I do not do the works of My Father [that is
 the miracles that only God could perform]
 then do not believe Me. ","But if I am doing them
 even if you do not believe Me or have faith in Me
 [at least] believe the works [that I do\u2014admit that they are the works of God]
 so that you may know and keep on knowing [clearly\u2014without any doubt] that the Father is in Me
 and I am in the Father [that is
 I am One with Him].\u201d ","When Jesus heard this
 He said
 \u201cThis sickness will not end in death; but [on the contrary it is] for the glory and honor of God
 so that the Son of God may be glorified by it.\u201d ","Then He said to His disciples
 \u201cLet us go back to Judea.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cAre there not twelve hours [of light] in the day? Anyone who walks in the daytime does not stumble
 because he sees  the light of this world. ","But if anyone walks in the night
 he stumbles
 because there is no light in him.\u201d ","He said this
 and after that said
 \u201cOur friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I am going there to wake him.\u201d ","So then Jesus told them plainly
 \u201cLazarus is dead. ","And for your sake I am glad that I was not there
 so that you may believe. But let us go to him.\u201d ","Then Thomas
 who was called Didymus (the twin)
 said to his fellow disciples
 \u201cLet us go too
 that we may die with Him.\u201d","Jesus told her
 \u201cYour brother will rise [from the dead].\u201d ","Jesus said to her
 \u201cI am the Resurrection and the Life. Whoever believes in (adheres to
 trusts in
 relies on) Me [as Savior] will live even if he dies; ","and everyone who lives and believes in Me [as Savior] will never die. Do you believe this?\u201d","She said to Him
 \u201cYes
 Lord; I have believed and continue to believe that You are the Christ (the Messiah
 the Anointed)
 the Son of God
 He who was [destined and promised] to come into the world [and it is for You that the world has waited].\u201d","When Mary came [to the place] where Jesus was and saw Him
 she fell at His feet
 saying to Him
 \u201cLord
 if You had been here
 my brother would not have died.\u201d ","and said
 \u201cWhere have you laid him?\u201d They said
 \u201cLord
 come and see.\u201d ","Jesus said
 \u201cTake away the stone.\u201d Martha
 the sister of the dead man
 said to Him
 \u201cLord
 by this time there will be an offensive odor
 for he has been dead four days! [It is hopeless!]\u201d ","Jesus said to her
 \u201cDid I not say to you that if you believe [in Me]
 you will see the glory of God [the expression of His excellence]?\u201d ","So they took away the stone. And Jesus raised His eyes [toward heaven] and said
 \u201cFather
 I thank You that You have heard Me. ","I knew that You always hear Me and listen to Me; but I have said this because of the people standing around
 so that they may believe that You have sent Me [and that You have made Me Your representative].\u201d ","When He had said this
 He shouted with a loud voice
 \u201cLazarus
 come out!\u201d ","Out came the man who had been dead
 his hands and feet tightly wrapped in burial cloths (linen strips)
 and with a  cloth wrapped around his face. Jesus said to them
 \u201cUnwrap him and release him.\u201d","So Jesus said
 \u201cLet her alone
 so that she may keep [the rest of] it for the day of My burial. ","You always have the poor with you
 but you do not always have Me.\u201d","So the people
 who were with Him when He called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead
 continued to tell others about Him. ","Then the Pharisees [argued and] said to one another
 \u201cYou see that your efforts are futile. Look! The whole world has gone  after Him!\u201d","these came to Philip
 who was from Bethsaida in Galilee
 with a request
 saying
 \u201cSir
 we wish to see Jesus.\u201d ","And Jesus answered them
 \u201cThe hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified and exalted. ","I assure you and most solemnly say to you
 unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies
 it remains alone [just one grain
 never more]. But if it dies
 it produces much grain and yields a harvest. ","The one who loves his life  loses it [through death]
 but the one who hates his life in this world [and is concerned with pleasing God] will keep it for life eternal. ","If anyone serves Me
 he must [continue to faithfully] follow Me [without hesitation
 holding steadfastly to Me
 conforming to My example in living and
 if need be
 suffering or perhaps dying because of faith in Me]; and wherever I am [in heaven\u2019s glory]
 there will My servant be also. If anyone serves Me
 the Father will honor him.","\u201cNow My soul is troubled and deeply distressed; what shall I say? \u2018Father
 save Me from this hour [of trial and agony]\u2019? But it is for this  purpose that I have come to this hour [this time and place]. ","[Rather
 I will say
] \u2018Father
 glorify (honor
 extol) Your name!\u2019\u201d Then a voice came from heaven saying
 \u201cI have both glorified it
 and will glorify it again.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cThis voice has come for your sake
 not for mine. ","Now judgment is upon this world [the sentence is being passed]. Now the ruler of this world (Satan) will be cast out.","And I
 if and when I am lifted up from the earth [on the cross]
 will draw all people to Myself [Gentiles
 as well as Jews].\u201d ","So Jesus said to them
 \u201cThe Light is among you  a little while longer. Walk while you have the Light [keep on living by it]
 so that darkness will not overtake you. He who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going [he is drifting aimlessly]. ","While you have the Light
 believe and trust in the Light [have faith in it
 hold on to it
 rely on it]
 so that you may become sons of Light [being filled with Light as followers of God].\u201d Jesus said these things
 and then He left and hid Himself from them. ","But Jesus loudly declared
 \u201cThe one who believes and trusts in Me does not believe  in Me but [also believes] in Him who sent Me. ","And whoever sees Me sees the One who sent Me.","I have come as Light into the world
 so that everyone who believes and trusts in Me [as Savior\u2014all those who anchor their hope in Me and rely on the truth of My message] will not continue to live in darkness. ","If anyone hears My words and does not keep them
 I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge and condemn the world [that is
 to initiate the final judgment of the world]
 but to save the world. ","Whoever rejects Me and refuses to accept My teachings
 has one who judges him; the very word that I spoke will judge and condemn him on the last day. ","For I have never spoken on My own initiative or authority
 but the Father Himself who sent Me has given Me a commandment regarding what to say and what to speak. ","I know that His commandment is eternal life. So the things I speak
 I speak [in accordance with His exact instruction
] just as the Father has told Me.\u201d","Jesus replied to him
 \u201cYou do not realize now what I am doing
 but you will  understand it later.\u201d ","Peter said to Him
 \u201cYou will never wash my feet!\u201d Jesus answered
 \u201cUnless I wash you
 you have no part with Me [we can have nothing to do with each other].\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cAnyone who has bathed needs only to wash his feet
 and is completely clean. And you [My disciples] are clean
 but not all of you.\u201d ","For He knew who was going to betray Him; for that reason He said
 \u201cNot all of you are clean.\u201d","So when He had washed their feet and put on His  robe and reclined at the table again
 He said to them
 \u201cDo you understand what I have done for you? ","You call Me Teacher and Lord
 and you are right in doing so
 for that is who I am. ","So if I
 the Lord and the Teacher
 washed your feet
 you ought to wash one another\u2019s feet as well. ","For I gave you [this as] an example
 so that you should do [in turn] as I did to you. ","I assure you and most solemnly say to you
 a slave is not greater than his master
 nor is one who is sent greater than the one who sent him. ","If you know these things
 you are blessed [happy and favored by God] if you put them into practice [and faithfully do them]. ","I am not speaking of all of you. I know whom I have chosen; but [this has happened] in order that the Scripture may be fulfilled: \u2018He who eats My bread has raised up his heel against Me [as My enemy].\u2019","From now on I am telling you [what will happen] before it occurs
 so that when it does take place you may believe that I am He [who I say I am\u2014the Christ
 the Anointed
 the Messiah]. ","I assure you and most solemnly say to you
 the one who receives and welcomes whomever I send receives Me; and the one who receives Me receives Him who sent Me [in that same way].\u201d","After Jesus had said these things
 He was troubled in spirit
 and testified and said
 \u201cI assure you and most solemnly say to you
 one of you will betray Me and hand Me over.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cIt is the one to whom I am going to give this piece [of bread] after I have dipped it.\u201d So when He had dipped the piece of bread [into the dish]
 He gave it to Judas
 son of Simon Iscariot. ","After [Judas had taken] the piece of bread
 Satan entered him. Then Jesus said to him
 \u201cWhat you are going to do
 do quickly [without delay].\u201d ","So when Judas had left
 Jesus said
 \u201cNow is [the time for] the Son of Man [to be] glorified
 and God is glorified in Him; ","[if God is glorified in Him
] God will also glorify Him (the Son) in Himself
 and will glorify Him at once. ","Little children
 I am with you  a little longer. You will look for Me and
 as I told the Jews

 that you love one another. Just as I have loved you
 so you too are to love one another. ","By this everyone will know that you are My disciples

 \u201cWill you  lay down your life for Me? I assure you and most solemnly say to you

 because You loved Me before the foundation of the world.","\u201cO just and righteous Father
 although the world has not known You and has never acknowledged You [and the revelation of Your mercy]
 yet I have always known You; and these  know [without any doubt] that You sent Me; ","and I have made Your name known to them
 and will continue to make it known
 so that the love with which You have loved Me may be in them [overwhelming their heart]
 and I [may be] in them.\u201d","Then Jesus
 knowing all that was about to happen to Him
 went to them and asked
 \u201cWhom do you want?\u201d ","They answered Him
 \u201cJesus the Nazarene.\u201d Jesus said
 \u201cI am He.\u201d And Judas
 who was betraying Him
 was also standing with them. ","When Jesus said
 \u201cI am He
\u201d they drew back and fell to the ground. ","Again He asked them
 \u201cWhom do you want?\u201d And they said
 \u201cJesus the Nazarene.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cI told you that I am He; so if you want Me
 let these men go on their way.\u201d ","So Jesus said to Peter
 \u201cPut the sword  in its sheath! Shall I not drink the cup which My Father has given Me?\u201d","Then the servant girl who kept the door said to Peter
 \u201cYou are not one of this Man\u2019s disciples
 are you?\u201d He said
 \u201cI am not.\u201d ","Jesus answered him
 \u201cI have spoken openly to the world. I always taught in a synagogue and in the temple 
 where all the Jews habitually congregate; and I said nothing in secret. ","Why question Me? Question those who have heard what I said to them. They know what I said.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cIf I have said anything wrong
 make a formal statement about the wrong; but if [I spoke] properly
 why did you strike Me?\u201d ","Then Pilate said to them
 \u201cTake Him yourselves and judge Him according to your own law.\u201d The Jews said
 \u201cWe are not permitted to put anyone to death.\u201d ","Jesus replied
 \u201cAre you saying this on your own initiative
 or did others tell you about Me?\u201d ","Jesus replied
 \u201cMy kingdom is not of this world [nor does it have its origin in this world]. If My kingdom were of this world
 My servants would be fighting  to keep Me from being handed over to the Jews; but as it is
 My kingdom is not of this world.\u201d ","So Pilate said to Him
 \u201cThen You are a King?\u201d Jesus answered
 \u201cYou say  that I am a King. This is why I was born
 and for this I have come into the world
 to testify to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth [who is a friend of the truth and belongs to the truth] hears and listens carefully to My voice.\u201d ","Then Pilate came out again and said to them
 \u201cLook
 I am bringing Him out to you so that you may know that I find no guilt in Him [no crime
 no cause for an accusation].\u201d ","So Jesus came out
 wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe
 and Pilate said to them
 \u201cLook! The Man!\u201d ","When the chief priests and officers saw Him
 they shouted
 \u201cCrucify ! Crucify !\u201d Pilate said to them
 \u201cTake Him yourselves and crucify Him
 for I find no guilt in Him [no crime
 no cause for an accusation].\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cYou would have no authority over Me at all if it had not been given to you from above. For this reason the sin and guilt of the one who handed Me over to you is greater [than your own].\u201d ","Now it was the day of Preparation for the Passover 
 and it was about the sixth hour. He said to the Jews
 \u201cLook
 your King!\u201d ","So Jesus
 seeing His mother
 and the disciple whom He loved (esteemed) standing near
 said to His mother
 \u201c woman
 look
 [here is] your son!\u201d ","Then He said to the disciple (John)
 \u201cLook! [here is] your mother [protect and provide for her]!\u201d From that hour the disciple took her into his own home.","After this
 Jesus
 knowing that all was now finished
 said in fulfillment of the Scripture
 \u201cI am thirsty.\u201d ","When Jesus had received the sour wine
 He said
 \u201cIt is finished!\u201d And He bowed His head and  gave up His spirit.","So she ran and went to Simon Peter and to the other disciple (John)
 whom Jesus loved (esteemed)
 and said to them
 \u201cThey have taken away the Lord out of the tomb
 and we do not know where they have laid Him!\u201d ","And they said to her
 \u201cWoman
 why are you crying?\u201d She told them
 \u201cBecause they have taken away my Lord
 and I do not know where they have laid Him.\u201d ","Jesus said to her
 \u201cWoman
 why are you crying? For whom are you looking?\u201d Supposing that He was the gardener
 she replied
 \u201cSir
 if you are the one who has carried Him away from here
 tell me where you have put Him
 and I will take Him away.\u201d ","Jesus said to her
 \u201cMary!\u201d She turned and said to Him in Hebrew
 \u201cRabboni!\u201d (which means
 Teacher). ","Jesus said to her
 \u201cDo not hold Me
 for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to My brothers and tell them
 \u2018I am ascending to My Father and your Father
 and to My God and your God.\u2019\u201d ","So when it was evening on that same day
 the first day of the week
 though the disciples were  behind barred doors for fear of the Jews
 Jesus came and stood among them
 and said
 \u201cPeace to you.\u201d ","Then Jesus said to them again
 \u201cPeace to you; as the Father has sent Me
 I also send you [as My representatives].\u201d ","And when He said this
 He breathed on them and said to them
 \u201cReceive the Holy Spirit. ","If you forgive the sins of anyone they are forgiven [because of their faith]; if you retain the sins of anyone
 they are retained [and remain unforgiven because of their unbelief].\u201d","So the other disciples kept telling him
 \u201cWe have seen the Lord!\u201d But he said to them
 \u201cUnless I see in His hands the marks of the nails
 and put my finger into the nail prints
 and put my hand into His side
 I will never believe.\u201d","Eight days later His disciples were again inside the house
 and Thomas was with them. Jesus came
 though the doors had been barred
 and stood among them and said
 \u201cPeace to you.\u201d ","Then He said to Thomas
 \u201cReach here with your finger
 and see My hands; and put out your hand and place it in My side. Do not be unbelieving
 but [stop doubting and] believe.\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cBecause you have seen Me
 do you now believe? Blessed [happy
 spiritually secure
 and favored by God] are they who did not see  and yet believed [in Me].\u201d","So Jesus said to them
 \u201cChildren
 do you have any fish [to eat along with your bread]?\u201d They answered
 \u201cNo.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cBring some of the fish which you have just caught.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cCome and have breakfast.\u201d None of the disciples dared to ask Him
 \u201cWho are You?\u201d They knew [without any doubt] that it was the Lord. ","So when they had finished breakfast
 Jesus said to Simon Peter
 \u201cSimon
 son of John
 do you love Me more than these [others do\u2014with total commitment and devotion]?\u201d He said to Him
 \u201cYes
 Lord; You know that I love You [with a deep
 personal affection
 as for a close friend].\u201d Jesus said to him
 \u201cFeed My lambs.\u201d ","Again He said to him a second time
 \u201cSimon
 son of John
 do you love Me [with total commitment and devotion]?\u201d He said to Him
 \u201cYes
 Lord; You know that I love You [with a deep
 personal affection
 as for a close friend].\u201d Jesus said to him
 \u201cShepherd My sheep.\u201d ","He said to him the third time
 \u201cSimon
 son of John
 do you love Me [with a deep
 personal affection for Me
 as for a close friend]?\u201d Peter was grieved that He asked him the third time
 \u201cDo you  love Me [with a deep
 personal affection
 as for a close friend]?\u201d And he said to Him
 \u201cLord
 You know everything; You know that I love You [with a deep
 personal affection
 as for a close friend].\u201d Jesus said to him
 \u201cFeed My sheep.","I assure you and most solemnly say to you
 when you were younger you dressed yourself and walked wherever you wished; but when you grow old
 you will stretch out your hands and arms
 and someone else will dress you
 and carry you where you do not wish to go.\u201d ","Now He said this to indicate the kind of death by which Peter would glorify God. And after saying this
 He said to him
 \u201cFollow Me [walk the same path of life that I have walked]!\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cIf I want him to stay alive until I come 
 what is that to you? You follow Me!\u201d ","So this word went out among the brothers that this disciple (John) was not going to die; yet Jesus did not say to him that he was not going to die
 but only
 \u201cIf I want him to stay alive until I come 
 what is that to you?\u201d","They asked him
 What then? Are you Elijah? And he said
 I am not! Are you the Prophet? And he answered
 No!","Then they said to him
 Who are you? Tell us
 so that we may give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?","He said
 I am the voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness [the voice of one shouting in the desert]
 Prepare the way of the Lord [level
 straighten out
 the path of the Lord]
 as the prophet Isaiah said.","But Jesus turned
 and as He saw them following Him
 He said to them
 What are you looking for? [And what is it you wish?] And they answered Him
 Rabbi\u2014which translated is Teacher\u2014where are You staying?","He said to them
 Come and see. So they went and saw where He was staying
 and they remained with Him  that day. It was then about the tenth hour (about four o\u2019clock in the afternoon).","Andrew then led (brought) Simon to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said
 You are Simon son of John. You shall be called Cephas\u2014which translated is Peter [Stone].","The next day Jesus desired and decided to go into Galilee; and He found Philip and said to him
 Join Me as My attendant and follow Me.","Philip sought and found Nathanael and told him
 We have found (discovered) the One Moses in the Law and also the Prophets wrote about\u2014Jesus from Nazareth
 the [legal] son of Joseph!","Nathanael answered him
 [Nazareth!] Can anything good come out of Nazareth? Philip replied
 Come and see!","Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward Him and said concerning him
 See! Here is an Israelite indeed [a true descendant of Jacob]
 in whom there is no guile nor deceit nor falsehood nor duplicity!","Nathanael said to Jesus
 How do You know me? [How is it that You know these things about me?] Jesus answered him
 Before [ever] Philip called you
 when you were still under the fig tree
 I saw you.","Jesus replied
 Because I said to you
 I saw you beneath the fig tree
 do you believe in and rely on and trust in Me? You shall see greater things than this!","Then He said to him
 I assure you
 most solemnly I tell you all
 you shall see heaven opened
 and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man!","Jesus said to her
 [Dear] woman
 what is that to you and to Me? [What do we have in common? Leave it to Me.] My time (hour to act) has not yet come.","Jesus said to them
 Fill the waterpots with water. So they filled them up to the brim.","Then He said to them
 Draw some out now and take it to the manager of the feast [to the one presiding
 the superintendent of the banquet]. So they took him some.","Then to those who sold the doves He said
 Take these things away (out of here)! Make not My Father\u2019s house a house of merchandise (a marketplace
 a sales shop)!","Jesus answered them
 Destroy (undo) this temple
 and in three days I will raise it up again.","Jesus answered him
 I assure you
 most solemnly I tell you
 that unless a person is born again (anew
 from above)
 he cannot ever see (know
 be acquainted with
 and experience) the kingdom of God.","Jesus answered
 I assure you
 most solemnly I tell you
 unless a man is born of water and [even] the Spirit
 he cannot [ever] enter the kingdom of God.","What is born of [from] the flesh is flesh [of the physical is physical]; and what is born of the Spirit is spirit.","Marvel not [do not be surprised
 astonished] at My telling you
 You must all be born anew (from above).","The wind blows (breathes) where it wills; and though you hear its sound
 yet you neither know where it comes from nor where it is going. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.","Jesus replied
 Are you the teacher of Israel
 and yet do not know nor understand these things? [Are they strange to you?]","I assure you
 most solemnly I tell you
 We speak only of what we know [we know absolutely what we are talking about]; we have actually seen what we are testifying to [we were eyewitnesses of it]. And still you do not receive our testimony [you reject and refuse our evidence\u2014that of Myself and of all those who are born of the Spirit].","If I have told you of things that happen right here on the earth and yet none of you believes Me
 how can you believe (trust Me
 adhere to Me
 rely on Me) if I tell you of heavenly things?","And yet no one has ever gone up to heaven
 but there is One Who has come down from heaven\u2014the Son of Man [Himself]
 Who is (dwells
 has His home) in heaven.","And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert [on a pole]
 so must [so it is necessary that] the Son of Man be lifted up [on the cross]
","In order that everyone who believes in Him [who cleaves to Him
 trusts Him
 and relies on Him] may not perish
 but have eternal life and [actually] live forever!","For God so greatly loved and dearly prized the world that He [even] gave up His only begotten (unique) Son
 so that whoever believes in (trusts in
 clings to
 relies on) Him shall not perish (come to destruction
 be lost) but have eternal (everlasting) life.","For God did not send the Son into the world in order to judge (to reject
 to condemn
 to pass sentence on) the world
 but that the world might find salvation and be made safe and sound through Him.","He who believes in Him [who clings to
 trusts in
 relies on Him] is not judged [he who trusts in Him never comes up for judgment; for him there is no rejection
 no condemnation\u2014he incurs no damnation]; but he who does not believe (cleave to
 rely on
 trust in Him) is judged already [he has already been convicted and has already received his sentence] because he has not believed in and trusted in the name of the only begotten Son of God. [He is condemned for refusing to let his trust rest in Christ\u2019s name.]","The [basis of the] judgment (indictment
 the test by which men are judged
 the ground for the sentence) lies in this: the Light has come into the world
 and people have loved the darkness rather than and more than the Light
 for their works (deeds) were evil.","For every wrongdoer hates (loathes
 detests) the Light
 and will not come out into the Light but shrinks from it
 lest his works (his deeds
 his activities
 his conduct) be exposed and reproved.","But he who practices truth [who does what is right] comes out into the Light; so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are\u2014wrought with God [divinely prompted
 done with God\u2019s help
 in dependence upon Him].","So they came to John and reported to him
 Rabbi
 the Man Who was with you on the other side of the Jordan [at the Jordan crossing]\u2014and to Whom you yourself have borne testimony\u2014notice
 here He is baptizing too
 and everybody is flocking to Him!","Presently
 when a woman of Samaria came along to draw water
 Jesus said to her
 Give Me a drink\u2014","Jesus answered her
 If you had only known and had recognized God\u2019s gift and Who this is that is saying to you
 Give Me a drink
 you would have asked Him [instead] and He would have given you living water.","Jesus answered her
 All who drink of this water will be thirsty again.","But whoever takes a drink of the water that I will give him shall never
 no never
 be thirsty any more. But the water that I will give him shall become a spring of water welling up (flowing
 bubbling) [continually] within him unto (into
 for) eternal life.","The woman said to Him
 Sir
 give me this water
 so that I may never get thirsty nor have to come [continually all the way] here to draw.","At this
 Jesus said to her
 Go
 call your husband and come back here.","The woman answered
 I have no husband. Jesus said to her
 You have spoken truly in saying
 I have no husband.","For you have had five husbands
 and the man you are now living with is not your husband. In this you have spoken truly.","Jesus said to her
 Woman
 believe Me
 a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither [merely] in this mountain nor [merely] in Jerusalem.","You [Samaritans] do not know what you are worshiping [you worship what you do not comprehend]. We do know what we are worshiping [we worship what we have knowledge of and understand]
 for [after all] salvation comes from [among] the Jews.","A time will come
 however
 indeed it is already here
 when the true (genuine) worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth (reality); for the Father is seeking just such people as these as His worshipers.","God is a Spirit (a spiritual Being) and those who worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth (reality).","Jesus said to her
 I Who now speak with you am He.","But He assured them
 I have food (nourishment) to eat of which you know nothing and have no idea.","Jesus said to them
 My food (nourishment) is to do the will (pleasure) of Him Who sent Me and to accomplish and completely finish His work.","Do you not say
 It is still four months until harvest time comes? Look! I tell you
 raise your eyes and observe the fields and see how they are already white for harvesting.","Already the reaper is getting his wages [he who does the cutting now has his reward]
 for he is gathering fruit (crop) unto life eternal
 so that he who does the planting and he who does the reaping may rejoice together.","For in this the saying holds true
 One sows and another reaps.","I sent you to reap a crop for which you have not toiled. Other men have labored and you have stepped in to reap the results of their work.","And they told the woman
 Now we no longer believe (trust
 have faith) just because of what you said; for we have heard Him ourselves [personally]
 and we know that He truly is the Savior of the world
 the Christ.","Then Jesus said to him
 Unless you see signs and miracles happen
 you [people] never will believe (trust
 have faith) at all.","Jesus answered him
 Go in peace; your son will live! And the man put his trust in what Jesus said and started home.","So he asked them at what time he had begun to get better. They said
 Yesterday during the seventh hour (about one o\u2019clock in the afternoon) the fever left him.","Then the father knew that it was at that very hour when Jesus had said to him
 Your son will live. And he and his entire household believed (adhered to
 trusted in
 and relied on Jesus).","When Jesus noticed him lying there [helpless]
 knowing that he had already been a long time in that condition
 He said to him
 Do you want to become well? [Are you really in earnest about getting well?]","Jesus said to him
 Get up! Pick up your bed (sleeping pad) and walk!","He answered them
 The Man Who healed me and gave me back my strength
 He Himself said to me
 Pick up your bed and walk!","Afterward
 when Jesus found him in the temple
 He said to him
 See
 you are well! Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you.","But Jesus answered them
 My Father has worked [even] until now
 [He has never ceased working; He is still working] and I
 too
 must be at [divine] work.","So Jesus answered them by saying
 I assure you
 most solemnly I tell you
 the Son is able to do nothing of Himself (of His own accord); but He is able to do only what He sees the Father doing
 for whatever the Father does is what the Son does in the same way [in His turn].","The Father dearly loves the Son and discloses to (shows) Him everything that He Himself does. And He will disclose to Him (let Him see) greater things yet than these
 so that you may marvel and be full of wonder and astonishment.","Just as the Father raises up the dead and gives them life [makes them live on]
 even so the Son also gives life to whomever He wills and is pleased to give it.","Even the Father judges no one
 for He has given all judgment (the last judgment and the whole business of judging) entirely into the hands of the Son
","So that all men may give honor (reverence
 homage) to the Son just as they give honor to the Father. [In fact] whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father
 Who has sent Him.","I assure you
 most solemnly I tell you
 the person whose ears are open to My words [who listens to My message] and believes and trusts in and clings to and relies on Him Who sent Me has (possesses now) eternal life. And he does not come into judgment [does not incur sentence of judgment
 will not come under condemnation]
 but he has already passed over out of death into life.","Believe Me when I assure you
 most solemnly I tell you
 the time is coming and is here now when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God and those who hear it shall live.","For even as the Father has life in Himself and is self-existent
 so He has given to the Son to have life in Himself and be self-existent.","And He has given Him authority and granted Him power to execute (exercise
 practice) judgment because He is a Son of man [very man].","Do not be surprised and wonder at this
 for the time is coming when all those who are in the tombs shall hear His voice
","And they shall come out\u2014those who have practiced doing good [will come out] to the resurrection of [new] life
 and those who have done evil will be raised for judgment [raised to meet their sentence].","I am able to do nothing from Myself [independently
 of My own accord\u2014but only as I am taught by God and as I get His orders]. Even as I hear
 I judge [I decide as I am bidden to decide. As the voice comes to Me
 so I give a decision]
 and My judgment is right (just
 righteous)
 because I do not seek or consult My own will [I have no desire to do what is pleasing to Myself
 My own aim
 My own purpose] but only the will and pleasure of the Father Who sent Me.","If I alone testify in My behalf
 My testimony is not valid and cannot be worth anything.","There is Another Who testifies concerning Me
 and I know and am certain that His evidence on My behalf is true and valid.","You yourselves have sent [an inquiry] to John and he has been a witness to the truth.","But I do not receive [a mere] human witness [the evidence which I accept on My behalf is not from man]; but I simply mention all these things in order that you may be saved (made and kept safe and sound).","John was the lamp that kept on burning and shining [to show you the way]
 and you were willing for a while to delight (sun) yourselves in his light.","But I have as My witness something greater (weightier
 higher
 better) than that of John; for the works that the Father has appointed Me to accomplish and finish
 the very same works that I am now doing
 are a witness and proof that the Father has sent Me.","And the Father Who sent Me has Himself testified concerning Me. Not one of you has ever given ear to His voice or seen His form (His face\u2014what He is like). [You have always been deaf to His voice and blind to the vision of Him.]","And you have not His word (His thought) living in your hearts
 because you do not believe and adhere to and trust in and rely on Him Whom He has sent. [That is why you do not keep His message living in you
 because you do not believe in the Messenger Whom He has sent.]","You search and investigate and pore over the Scriptures diligently
 because you suppose and trust that you have eternal life through them. And these [very Scriptures] testify about Me!","And still you are not willing [but refuse] to come to Me
 so that you might have life.","I receive not glory from men [I crave no human honor
 I look for no mortal fame]
","But I know you and recognize and understand that you have not the love of God in you.","I have come in My Father\u2019s name and with His power
 and you do not receive Me [your hearts are not open to Me
 you give Me no welcome]; but if another comes in his own name and his own power and with no other authority but himself
 you will receive him and give him your approval.","How is it possible for you to believe [how can you learn to believe]
 you who [are content to seek and] receive praise and honor and glory from one another
 and yet do not seek the praise and honor and glory which come from Him Who alone is God?","Put out of your minds the thought and do not suppose [as some of you are supposing] that I will accuse you before the Father. There is one who accuses you\u2014it is Moses
 the very one on whom you have built your hopes [in whom you trust].","For if you believed and relied on Moses
 you would believe and rely on Me
 for he wrote about Me [personally].","But if you do not believe and trust his writings
 how then will you believe and trust My teachings? [How shall you cleave to and rely on My words?]","Jesus looked up then
 and seeing that a vast multitude was coming toward Him
 He said to Philip
 Where are we to buy bread
 so that all these people may eat?","Jesus said
 Make all the people recline (sit down). Now the ground (a pasture) was covered with thick grass at the spot
 so the men threw themselves down
 about 5
000 in number.","When they had all had enough
 He said to His disciples
 Gather up now the fragments (the broken pieces that are left over)
 so that nothing may be lost and wasted.","But Jesus said to them
 It is I; be not afraid! [I Am; stop being frightened!]","Jesus answered them
 I assure you
 most solemnly I tell you
 you have been searching for Me
 not because you saw the miracles and signs but because you were fed with the loaves and were filled and satisfied.","Stop toiling and doing and producing for the food that perishes and decomposes [in the using]
 but strive and work and produce rather for the [lasting] food which endures [continually] unto life eternal; the Son of Man will give (furnish) you that
 for God the Father has authorized and certified Him and put His seal of endorsement upon Him.","Jesus replied
 This is the work (service) that God asks of you: that you believe in the One Whom He has sent [that you cleave to
 trust
 rely on
 and have faith in His Messenger].","Jesus then said to them
 I assure you
 most solemnly I tell you
 Moses did not give you the Bread from heaven [what Moses gave you was not the Bread from heaven]
 but it is My Father Who gives you the true heavenly Bread.","For the Bread of God is He Who comes down out of heaven and gives life to the world.","Jesus replied
 I am the Bread of Life. He who comes to Me will never be hungry
 and he who believes in and cleaves to and trusts in and relies on Me will never thirst any more (at any time).","But [as] I told you
 although you have seen Me
 still you do not believe and trust and have faith.","All whom My Father gives (entrusts) to Me will come to Me; and the one who comes to Me I will most certainly not cast out [I will never
 no never
 reject one of them who comes to Me].","For I have come down from heaven not to do My own will and purpose but to do the will and purpose of Him Who sent Me.","And this is the will of Him Who sent Me
 that I should not lose any of all that He has given Me
 but that I should give new life and raise [them all] up at the last day.","For this is My Father\u2019s will and His purpose
 that everyone who sees the Son and believes in and cleaves to and trusts in and relies on Him should have eternal life
 and I will raise him up [from the dead] at the last day.","So Jesus answered them
 Stop grumbling and saying things against Me to one another.","No one is able to come to Me unless the Father Who sent Me attracts and draws him and gives him the desire to come to Me
 and [then] I will raise him up [from the dead] at the last day.","It is written in [the book of] the Prophets
 And they shall all be taught of God [have Him in person for their Teacher]. Everyone who has listened to and learned from the Father comes to Me\u2014","Which does not imply that anyone has seen the Father [not that anyone has ever seen Him] except He [Who was with the Father] Who comes from God; He [alone] has seen the Father.","I assure you
 most solemnly I tell you
 he who believes in Me [who adheres to
 trusts in
 relies on
 and has faith in Me] has (now possesses) eternal life.","I am the Bread of Life [that gives life\u2014the Living Bread].","Your forefathers ate the manna in the wilderness
 and [yet] they died.","[But] this is the Bread that comes down from heaven
 so that [any]one may eat of it and never die.","I [Myself] am this Living Bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this Bread
 he will live forever; and also the Bread that I shall give for the life of the world is My flesh (body).","And Jesus said to them
 I assure you
 most solemnly I tell you
 you cannot have any life in you unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood [unless you appropriate His life and the saving merit of His blood].","He who feeds on My flesh and drinks My blood has (possesses now) eternal life
 and I will raise him up [from the dead] on the last day.","For My flesh is true and genuine food
 and My blood is true and genuine drink.","He who feeds on My flesh and drinks My blood dwells continually in Me
 and I [in like manner dwell continually] in him.","Just as the living Father sent Me and I live by (through
 because of) the Father
 even so whoever continues to feed on Me [whoever takes Me for his food and is nourished by Me] shall [in his turn] live through and because of Me.","This is the Bread that came down from heaven. It is not like the manna which our forefathers ate
 and yet died; he who takes this Bread for his food shall live forever.","But Jesus
 knowing within Himself that His disciples were complaining and protesting and grumbling about it
 said to them: Is this a stumbling block and an offense to you? [Does this upset and displease and shock and scandalize you?]","What then [will be your reaction] if you should see the Son of Man ascending to [the place] where He was before?","It is the Spirit Who gives life [He is the Life-giver]; the flesh conveys no benefit whatever [there is no profit in it]. The words (truths) that I have been speaking to you are spirit and life.","But [still] some of you fail to believe and trust and have faith. For Jesus knew from the first who did not believe and had no faith and who would betray Him and be false to Him.","And He said
 This is why I told you that no one can come to Me unless it is granted him [unless he is enabled to do so] by the Father.","Jesus said to the Twelve
 Will you also go away? [And do you too desire to leave Me?]","Jesus answered them
 Did I not choose you
 the Twelve? And [yet] one of you is a devil (of the evil one and a false accuser).","So His brothers said to Him
 Leave here and go into Judea
 so that Your disciples [there] may also see the works that You do. [This is no place for You.]","Whereupon Jesus said to them
 My time (opportunity) has not come yet; but any time is suitable for you and your opportunity is ready any time [is always here].","The world cannot [be expected to] hate you
 but it does hate Me because I denounce it for its wicked works and reveal that its doings are evil.","Go to the Feast yourselves. I am not [yet] going up to the Festival
 because My time is not ripe. [My term is not yet completed; it is not time for Me to go.]","Jesus answered them by saying
 My teaching is not My own
 but His Who sent Me.","If any man desires to do His will (God\u2019s pleasure)
 he will know (have the needed illumination to recognize
 and can tell for himself) whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking from Myself and of My own accord and on My own authority.","He who speaks on his own authority seeks to win honor for himself. [He whose teaching originates with himself seeks his own glory.] But He Who seeks the glory and is eager for the honor of Him Who sent Him
 He is true; and there is no unrighteousness or falsehood or deception in Him.","Did not Moses give you the Law? And yet not one of you keeps the Law. [If that is the truth] why do you seek to kill Me [for not keeping it]?","Jesus answered them
 I did one work
 and you all are astounded.","Now Moses established circumcision among you\u2014though it did not originate with Moses but with the previous patriarchs\u2014and you circumcise a person [even] on the Sabbath day.","If
 to avoid breaking the Law of Moses
 a person undergoes circumcision on the Sabbath day
 have you any cause to be angry with (indignant with
 bitter against) Me for making a man\u2019s whole body well on the Sabbath?","Be honest in your judgment and do not decide at a glance (superficially and by appearances); but judge fairly and righteously.","Then some of the Jerusalem people said
 Is not this the Man they seek to kill?","Whereupon Jesus called out as He taught in the temple [porches]
 Do you know Me
 and do you know where I am from? I have not come on My own authority and of My own accord and as self-appointed
 but the One Who sent Me is true (real
 genuine
 steadfast); and Him you do not know!","I know Him [Myself] because I come from His [very] presence
 and it was He [personally] Who sent Me.","Therefore Jesus said
 For a little while I am [still] with you
 and then I go back to Him Who sent Me.","You will look for Me
 but you will not [be able to] find Me; where I am
 you cannot come.","Then the Jews said among themselves
 Where does this Man intend to go that we shall not find Him? Will He go to the Jews who are scattered in the Dispersion among the Greeks
 and teach the Greeks?","Now on the final and most important day of the Feast
 Jesus stood
 and He cried in a loud voice
 If any man is thirsty
 let him come to Me and drink!","He who believes in Me [who cleaves to and trusts in and relies on Me] as the Scripture has said
 From his innermost being shall flow [continuously] springs and rivers of living water.","But He was speaking here of the Spirit
 Whom those who believed (trusted
 had faith) in Him were afterward to receive. For the [Holy] Spirit had not yet been given
 because Jesus was not yet glorified (raised to honor).","Teacher
 they said
 This woman has been caught in the very act of adultery.","However
 when they persisted with their question
 He raised Himself up and said
 Let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her.","When Jesus raised Himself up
 He said to her
 Woman
 where are your accusers? Has no man condemned you?","She answered
 No one
 Lord! And Jesus said
 I do not condemn you either. Go on your way and from now on sin no more.","Once more Jesus addressed the crowd. He said
 I am the Light of the world. He who follows Me will not be walking in the dark
 but will have the Light which is Life.","Jesus answered
 Even if I do testify on My own behalf
 My testimony is true and reliable and valid
 for I know where I came from and where I am going; but you do not know where I come from or where I am going.","You [set yourselves up to] judge according to the flesh (by what you see). [You condemn by external
 human standards.] I do not [set Myself up to] judge or condemn or sentence anyone.","Yet even if I do judge
 My judgment is true [My decision is right]; for I am not alone [in making it]
 but [there are two of Us] I and the Father
 Who sent Me.","In your [own] Law it is written that the testimony (evidence) of two persons is reliable and valid.","I am One [of the Two] bearing testimony concerning Myself; and My Father
 Who sent Me
 He also testifies about Me.","Then they said to Him
 Where is this Father of Yours? Jesus answered
 You know My Father as little as you know Me. If you knew Me
 you would know My Father also.","Therefore He said again to them
 I am going away
 and you will be looking for Me
 and you will die in (under the curse of) your sin. Where I am going
 it is not possible for you to come.","He said to them
 You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world (of this earthly order); I am not of this world.","That is why I told you that you will die in (under the curse of) your sins; for if you do not believe that I am He [Whom I claim to be\u2014if you do not adhere to
 trust in
 and rely on Me]
 you will die in your sins.","Then they said to Him
 Who are You anyway? Jesus replied
 [Why do I even speak to you!] I am exactly what I have been telling you from the first.","I have much to say about you and to judge and condemn. But He Who sent Me is true (reliable)
 and I tell the world [only] the things that I have heard from Him.","So Jesus added
 When you have lifted up the Son of Man [on the cross]
 you will realize (know
 understand) that I am He [for Whom you look] and that I do nothing of Myself (of My own accord or on My own authority)
 but I say [exactly] what My Father has taught Me.","And He Who sent Me is ever with Me; My Father has not left Me alone
 for I always do what pleases Him.","So Jesus said to those Jews who had believed in Him
 If you abide in My word [hold fast to My teachings and live in accordance with them]
 you are truly My disciples.","And you will know the Truth
 and the Truth will set you free.","Jesus answered them
 I assure you
 most solemnly I tell you
 Whoever commits and practices sin is the slave of sin.","Now a slave does not remain in a household permanently (forever); the son [of the house] does remain forever.","So if the Son liberates you [makes you free men]
 then you are really and unquestionably free.","[Yes] I know that you are Abraham\u2019s offspring; yet you plan to kill Me
 because My word has no entrance (makes no progress
 does not find any place) in you.","I tell the things which I have seen and learned at My Father\u2019s side
 and your actions also reflect what you have heard and learned from your father.","They retorted
 Abraham is our father. Jesus said
 If you were [truly] Abraham\u2019s children
 then you would do the works of Abraham [follow his example
 do as Abraham did].","But now [instead] you are wanting and seeking to kill Me
 a Man Who has told you the truth which I have heard from God. This is not the way Abraham acted.","You are doing the works of your [own] father. They said to Him
 We are not illegitimate children and born out of fornication; we have one Father
 even God.","Jesus said to them
 If God were your Father
 you would love Me and respect Me and welcome Me gladly
 for I proceeded (came forth) from God [out of His very presence]. I did not even come on My own authority or of My own accord (as self-appointed); but He sent Me.","Why do you misunderstand what I say? It is because you are unable to hear what I am saying. [You cannot bear to listen to My message; your ears are shut to My teaching.]","You are of your father
 the devil
 and it is your will to practice the lusts and gratify the desires [which are characteristic] of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth
 because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a falsehood
 he speaks what is natural to him
 for he is a liar [himself] and the father of lies and of all that is false.","But because I speak the truth
 you do not believe Me [do not trust Me
 do not rely on Me
 or adhere to Me].","Who of you convicts Me of wrongdoing or finds Me guilty of sin? Then if I speak truth
 why do you not believe Me [trust Me
 rely on
 and adhere to Me]?","Whoever is of God listens to God. [Those who belong to God hear the words of God.] This is the reason that you do not listen [to those words
 to Me]: because you do not belong to God and are not of God or in harmony with Him.","Jesus answered
 I am not possessed by a demon. On the contrary
 I honor and reverence My Father and you dishonor (despise
 vilify
 and scorn) Me.","However
 I am not in search of honor for Myself. [I do not seek and am not aiming for My own glory.] There is One Who [looks after that; He] seeks [My glory]
 and He is the Judge.","I assure you
 most solemnly I tell you
 if anyone observes My teaching [lives in accordance with My message
 keeps My word]
 he will by no means ever see and experience death.","The Jews said to Him
 Now we know that You are under the power of a demon (insane). Abraham died
 and also the prophets
 yet You say
 If a man keeps My word
 he will never taste of death into all eternity.","Jesus answered
 If I were to glorify Myself (magnify
 praise
 and honor Myself)
 I would have no real glory
 for My glory would be nothing and worthless. [My honor must come to Me from My Father.] It is My Father Who glorifies Me [Who extols Me
 magnifies
 and praises Me]
 of Whom you say that He is your God.","Yet you do not know Him or recognize Him and are not acquainted with Him
 but I know Him. If I should say that I do not know Him
 I would be a liar like you. But I know Him and keep His word [obey His teachings
 am faithful to His message].","Your forefather Abraham was extremely happy at the hope and prospect of seeing My day (My incarnation); and he did see it and was delighted.","Jesus replied
 I assure you
 most solemnly I tell you
 before Abraham was born
 I Am.","Jesus answered
 It was not that this man or his parents sinned
 but he was born blind in order that the workings of God should be manifested (displayed and illustrated) in him.","We must work the works of Him Who sent Me and be busy with His business while it is daylight; night is coming on
 when no man can work.","As long as I am in the world
 I am the world\u2019s Light.","And He said to him
 Go
 wash in the Pool of Siloam\u2014which means Sent. So he went and washed
 and came back seeing.","He replied
 The Man called Jesus made mud and smeared it on my eyes and said to me
 Go to Siloam and wash. So I went and washed
 and I obtained my sight!","They asked him
 Where is He? He said
 I do not know.","So the second time they summoned the man who had been born blind
 and said to him
 Now give God the glory (praise). This Fellow we know is only a sinner (a wicked person).","Then he answered
 I do not know whether He is a sinner and wicked or not. But one thing I do know
 that whereas I was blind before
 now I see.","So they said to him
 What did He [actually] do to you? How did He open your eyes?","He answered
 I already told you and you would not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Can it be that you wish to become His disciples also?","Jesus heard that they had put him out
 and meeting him He said
 Do you believe in and adhere to the Son of Man or the Son of God?","Jesus said to him
 You have seen Him; [in fact] He is talking to you right now.","Then Jesus said
 I came into this world for judgment [as a Separator
 in order that there may be  separation between those who believe on Me and those who reject Me]
 to make the sightless see and to make those who see become blind.","Jesus said to them
 If you were blind
 you would have no sin; but because you now claim to have sight
 your sin remains. [If you were blind
 you would not be guilty of sin; but because you insist
 We do see clearly
 you are unable to escape your guilt.]","I assure you
 most solemnly I tell you
 he who does not enter by the door into the sheepfold
 but climbs up some other way (elsewhere
 from some other quarter) is a thief and a robber.","But he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.","The watchman opens the door for this man
 and the sheep listen to his voice and heed it; and he calls his own sheep by name and brings (leads) them out.","When he has brought his own sheep outside
 he walks on before them
 and the sheep follow him because they know his voice.","They will never [on any account] follow a stranger
 but will run away from him because they do not know the voice of strangers or recognize their call.","So Jesus said again
 I assure you
 most solemnly I tell you
 that I Myself am the Door for the sheep.","All others who came [as such] before Me are thieves and robbers
 but the [true] sheep did not listen to and obey them.","I am the Door; anyone who enters in through Me will be saved (will live). He will come in and he will go out [freely]
 and will find pasture.","The thief comes only in order to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have and enjoy life
 and have it in abundance (to the full
 till it overflows).","I am the Good Shepherd. The Good Shepherd risks and lays down His [own] life for the sheep.","But the hired servant (he who merely serves for wages) who is neither the shepherd nor the owner of the sheep
 when he sees the wolf coming
 deserts the flock and runs away. And the wolf chases and snatches them and scatters [the flock].","Now the hireling flees because he merely serves for wages and is not himself concerned about the sheep [cares nothing for them].","I am the Good Shepherd; and I know and recognize My own
 and My own know and recognize Me\u2014","Even as [truly as] the Father knows Me and I also know the Father\u2014and I am giving My [very own] life and laying it down on behalf of the sheep.","And I have other sheep [beside these] that are not of this fold. I must bring and impel those also; and they will listen to My voice and heed My call
 and so there will be [they will become] one flock under one Shepherd.","For this [reason] the Father loves Me
 because I lay down My [own] life\u2014to take it back again.","No one takes it away from Me. On the contrary
 I lay it down voluntarily. [I put it from Myself.] I am authorized and have power to lay it down (to resign it) and I am authorized and have power to take it back again. These are the instructions (orders) which I have received [as My charge] from My Father.","Jesus answered them
 I have told you so
 yet you do not believe Me [you do not trust Me and rely on Me]. The very works that I do by the power of My Father and in My Father\u2019s name bear witness concerning Me [they are My credentials and evidence in support of Me].","But you do not believe and trust and rely on Me because you do not belong to My fold [you are no sheep of Mine].","The sheep that are My own hear and are listening to My voice; and I know them
 and they follow Me.","And I give them eternal life
 and they shall never lose it or perish throughout the ages. [To all eternity they shall never by any means be destroyed.] And no one is able to snatch them out of My hand.","My Father
 Who has given them to Me
 is greater and mightier than all [else]; and no one is able to snatch [them] out of the Father\u2019s hand.","I and the Father are One.","Jesus said to them
 My Father has enabled Me to do many good deeds. [I have shown many acts of mercy in your presence.] For which of these do you mean to stone Me?","Jesus answered
 Is it not written in your Law
 I said
 You are gods?","So men are called gods [by the Law]
 men to whom God\u2019s message came\u2014and the Scripture cannot be set aside or cancelled or broken or annulled\u2014","[If that is true] do you say of the One Whom the Father consecrated and dedicated and set apart for Himself and sent into the world
 You are blaspheming
 because I said
 I am the Son of God?","If I am not doing the works [performing the deeds] of My Father
 then do not believe Me [do not adhere to Me and trust Me and rely on Me].","But if I do them
 even though you do not believe Me or have faith in Me
 [at least] believe the works and have faith in what I do
 in order that you may know and understand [clearly] that the Father is in Me
 and I am in the Father [One with Him].","When Jesus received the message
 He said
 This sickness is not to end in death; but [on the contrary] it is to honor God and to promote His glory
 that the Son of God may be glorified through (by) it.","Then after that interval He said to His disciples
 Let us go back again to Judea.","Jesus answered
 Are there not twelve hours in the day? Anyone who walks about in the daytime does not stumble
 because he sees [by] the light of this world.","But if anyone walks about in the night
 he does stumble
 because there is no light in him [the light is lacking to him].","He said these things
 and then added
 Our friend Lazarus is at rest and sleeping; but I am going there that I may awaken him out of his sleep.","So then Jesus told them plainly
 Lazarus is dead
","And for your sake I am glad that I was not there; it will help you to believe (to trust and rely on Me). However
 let us go to him.","Then Thomas
 who was called the Twin
 said to his fellow disciples
 Let us go too
 that we may die [be killed] along with Him.","Jesus said to her
 Your brother shall rise again.","Jesus said to her
 I am [Myself] the Resurrection and the Life. Whoever believes in (adheres to
 trusts in
 and relies on) Me
 although he may die
 yet he shall live;","And whoever continues to live and believes in (has faith in
 cleaves to
 and relies on) Me shall never [actually] die at all. Do you believe this?","She said to Him
 Yes
 Lord
 I have believed [I do believe] that You are the Christ (the Messiah
 the Anointed One)
 the Son of God
 [even He] Who was to come into the world. [It is for Your coming that the world has waited.]","When Mary came to the place where Jesus was and saw Him
 she dropped down at His feet
 saying to Him
 Lord
 if You had been here
 my brother would not have died.","And He said
 Where have you laid him? They said to Him
 Lord
 come and see.","Jesus said
 Take away the stone. Martha
 the sister of the dead man
 exclaimed
 But Lord
 by this time he [is decaying and] throws off an offensive odor
 for he has been dead four days!","Jesus said to her
 Did I not tell you and promise you that if you would believe and rely on Me
 you would see the glory of God?","So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up His eyes and said
 Father
 I thank You that You have heard Me.","Yes
 I know You always hear and listen to Me
 but I have said this on account of and for the benefit of the people standing around
 so that they may believe that You did send Me [that You have made Me Your Messenger].","When He had said this
 He shouted with a loud voice
 Lazarus
 come out!","And out walked the man who had been dead
 his hands and feet wrapped in burial cloths (linen strips)
 and with a [burial] napkin bound around his face. Jesus said to them
 Free him of the burial wrappings and let him go.","But Jesus said
 Let her alone. It was [intended] that she should keep it for the time of My preparation for burial. [She has kept it that she might have it for the time of My embalming.]","You always have the poor with you
 but you do not always have Me.","The group that had been with Jesus when He called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from among the dead kept telling it [bearing witness] to others.","Then the Pharisees said among themselves
 You see how futile your efforts are and how you accomplish nothing. See! The whole world is running after Him!","These came to Philip
 who was from Bethsaida in Galilee
 and they made this request
 Sir
 we desire to see Jesus.","And Jesus answered them
 The time has come for the Son of Man to be glorified and exalted.","I assure you
 most solemnly I tell you
 Unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies
 it remains [just one grain; it never becomes more but lives] by itself alone. But if it dies
 it produces many others and yields a rich harvest.","Anyone who loves his life loses it
 but anyone who hates his life in this world will keep it to life eternal. [Whoever has no love for
 no concern for
 no regard for his life here on earth
 but despises it
 preserves his life forever and ever.]","If anyone serves Me
 he must continue to follow Me [to cleave steadfastly to Me
 conform wholly to My example in living and
 if need be
 in dying] and wherever I am
 there will My servant be also. If anyone serves Me
 the Father will honor him.","Now My soul is troubled and distressed
 and what shall I say? Father
 save Me from this hour [of trial and agony]? But it was for this very purpose that I have come to this hour [that I might undergo it].","[Rather
 I will say
] Father
 glorify (honor and extol) Your [own] name! Then there came a voice out of heaven saying
 I have already glorified it
 and I will glorify it again.","Jesus answered
 This voice has not come for My sake
 but for your sake.","Now the judgment (crisis) of this world is coming on [sentence is now being passed on this world]. Now the ruler (evil genius
 prince) of this world shall be cast out (expelled).","And I
 if and when I am lifted up from the earth [on the cross]
 will draw and attract all men [Gentiles as well as Jews] to Myself.","So Jesus said to them
 You will have the Light only a little while longer. Walk while you have the Light [keep on living by it]
 so that darkness may not overtake and overcome you. He who walks about in the dark does not know where he goes [he is drifting].","While you have the Light
 believe in the Light [have faith in it
 hold to it
 rely on it]
 that you may become sons of the Light and be filled with Light. Jesus said these things
 and then He went away and hid Himself from them [was lost to their view].","But Jesus loudly declared
 The one who believes in Me does not [only] believe in and trust in and rely on Me
 but [in believing in Me he believes] in Him Who sent Me.","And whoever sees Me sees Him Who sent Me.","I have come as a Light into the world
 so that whoever believes in Me [whoever cleaves to and trusts in and relies on Me] may not continue to live in darkness.","If anyone hears My teachings and fails to observe them [does not keep them
 but disregards them]
 it is not I who judges him. For I have not come to judge and to condemn and to pass sentence and to inflict penalty on the world
 but to save the world.","Anyone who rejects Me and persistently sets Me at naught
 refusing to accept My teachings
 has his judge [however]; for the [very] message that I have spoken will itself judge and convict him at the last day.","This is because I have never spoken on My own authority or of My own accord or as self-appointed
 but the Father Who sent Me has Himself given Me orders [concerning] what to say and what to tell.","And I know that His commandment is (means) eternal life. So whatever I speak
 I am saying [exactly] what My Father has told Me to say and in accordance with His instructions.","Jesus said to him
 You do not understand now what I am doing
 but you will understand later on.","Peter said to Him
 You shall never wash my feet! Jesus answered him
 Unless I wash you
 you have no part with (in) Me [you have no share in companionship with Me].","Jesus said to him
 Anyone who has bathed needs only to wash his feet
 but is clean all over. And you [My disciples] are clean
 but not all of you.","For He knew who was going to betray Him; that was the reason He said
 Not all of you are clean.","So when He had finished washing their feet and had put on His garments and had sat down again
 He said to them
 Do you understand what I have done to you?","You call Me the Teacher (Master) and the Lord
 and you are right in doing so
 for that is what I am.","If I then
 your Lord and Teacher (Master)
 have washed your feet
 you ought [it is your duty
 you are under obligation
 you owe it] to wash one another\u2019s feet.","For I have given you this as an example
 so that you should do [in your turn] what I have done to you.","I assure you
 most solemnly I tell you
 A servant is not greater than his master
 and no one who is sent is superior to the one who sent him.","If you know these things
 blessed and happy and to be envied are you if you practice them [if you act accordingly and really do them].","I am not speaking of and I do not mean all of you. I know whom I have chosen; but it is that the Scripture may be fulfilled
 He who eats My bread with Me has raised up his heel against Me.","I tell you this now before it occurs
 so that when it does take place you may be persuaded and believe that I am He [Who I say I am\u2014the Christ
 the Anointed One
 the Messiah].","I assure you
 most solemnly I tell you
 he who receives and welcomes and takes into his heart any messenger of Mine receives Me [in just that way]; and he who receives and welcomes and takes Me into his heart receives Him Who sent Me [in that same way].","After Jesus had said these things
 He was troubled (disturbed
 agitated) in spirit and said
 I assure you
 most solemnly I tell you
 one of you will deliver Me up [one of you will be false to Me and betray Me]!","Jesus answered
 It is the one to whom I am going to give this morsel (bit) of food after I have dipped it. So when He had dipped the morsel of bread [into the dish]
 He gave it to Judas
 Simon Iscariot\u2019s son.","Then after [he had taken] the bit of food
 Satan entered into and took possession of [Judas]. Jesus said to him
 What you are going to do
 do more swiftly than you seem to intend and make quick work of it.","When he had left
 Jesus said
 Now is the Son of Man glorified! [Now He has achieved His glory
 His honor
 His exaltation!] And God has been glorified through and in Him.","And if God is glorified through and in Him
 God will also glorify Him in Himself
 and He will glorify Him at once and not delay.","[Dear] little children
 I am to be with you only a little longer. You will look for Me and
 as I told the Jews
 so I tell you now: you are not able to come where I am going.","I give you a new commandment: that you should love one another. Just as I have loved you
 so you too should love one another.","By this shall all [men] know that you are My disciples
 if you love one another [if you keep on showing love among yourselves].","Simon Peter said to Him
 Lord
 where are You going? Jesus answered
 You are not able to follow Me now where I am going
 but you shall follow Me afterwards.","Jesus answered
 Will you [really] lay down your life for Me? I assure you
 most solemnly I tell you
 before a rooster crows
 you will deny Me [completely disown Me] three times.","Do not let your hearts be troubled (distressed
 agitated). You believe in and adhere to and trust in and rely on God; believe in and adhere to and trust in and rely also on Me.","In My Father\u2019s house there are many dwelling places (homes). If it were not so
 I would have told you; for I am going away to prepare a place for you.","And when (if) I go and make ready a place for you
 I will come back again and will take you to Myself
 that where I am you may be also.","And [to the place] where I am going
 you know the way.","Jesus said to him
 I am the Way and the Truth and the Life; no one comes to the Father except by (through) Me.","If you had known Me [had learned to recognize Me]
 you would also have known My Father. From now on
 you know Him and have seen Him.","Jesus replied
 Have I been with all of you for so long a time
 and do you not recognize and know Me yet
 Philip? Anyone who has seen Me has seen the Father. How can you say then
 Show us the Father?","Do you not believe that I am in the Father
 and that the Father is in Me? What I am telling you I do not say on My own authority and of My own accord; but the Father Who lives continually in Me does the (His) works (His own miracles
 deeds of power).","Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father in Me; or else believe Me for the sake of the [very] works themselves. [If you cannot trust Me
 at least let these works that I do in My Father\u2019s name convince you.]","I assure you
 most solemnly I tell you
 if anyone steadfastly believes in Me
 he will himself be able to do the things that I do; and he will do even greater things than these
 because I go to the Father.","And I will do [I Myself will grant] whatever you ask in My Name [as presenting all that I Am]
 so that the Father may be glorified and extolled in (through) the Son.","[Yes] I will grant [I Myself will do for you] whatever you shall ask in My Name [as presenting all that I Am].","If you [really] love Me
 you will keep (obey) My commands.","And I will ask the Father
 and He will give you another Comforter (Counselor

 knowing all that was about to befall Him
 went out to them and said
 Whom are you seeking? [Whom do you want?]","They answered Him
 Jesus the Nazarene. Jesus said to them
 I am He. Judas
 who was betraying Him
 was also standing with them.","When Jesus said to them
 I am He
 they went backwards (drew back
 lurched backward) and fell to the ground.","Then again He asked them
 Whom are you seeking? And they said
 Jesus the Nazarene.","Jesus answered
 I told you that I am He. So
 if you want Me [if it is only I for Whom you are looking]
 let these men go their way.","Therefore
 Jesus said to Peter
 Put the sword [back] into the sheath! The cup which My Father has given Me
 shall I not drink it?","Then the maid who was in charge at the door said to Peter
 You are not also one of the disciples of this Man
 are you? He said
 I am not!","Jesus answered him
 I have spoken openly to the world. I have always taught in a synagogue and in the temple [area]
 where the Jews [habitually] congregate (assemble); and I have spoken nothing secretly.","Why do you ask Me? Ask those who have heard [Me] what I said to them. See! They know what I said.","Jesus replied
 If I have said anything wrong [if I have spoken abusively
 if there was evil in what I said] tell what was wrong with it. But if I spoke rightly and properly
 why do you strike Me?","Pilate said to them
 Take Him yourselves and judge and sentence and punish Him according to your [own] law. The Jews answered
 It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death.","Jesus replied
 Are you saying this of yourself [on your own initiative]
 or have others told you about Me?","Jesus answered
 My kingdom (kingship
 royal power) belongs not to this world. If My kingdom were of this world
 My followers would have been fighting to keep Me from being handed over to the Jews. But as it is
 My kingdom is not from here (this world); [it has no such origin or source].","Pilate said to Him
 Then You are a King? Jesus answered
 You say it! [You speak correctly!] For I am a King. [Certainly I am a King!] This is why I was born
 and for this I have come into the world
 to bear witness to the Truth. Everyone who is of the Truth [who is a friend of the Truth
 who belongs to the Truth] hears and listens to My voice.","Then Pilate went out again and said to them
 See
 I bring Him out to you
 so that you may know that I find no fault (crime
 cause for accusation) in Him.","So Jesus came out wearing the thorny crown and purple cloak
 and Pilate said to them
 See
 [here is] the Man!","When the chief priests and attendants (guards) saw Him
 they cried out
 Crucify Him! Crucify Him! Pilate said to them
 Take Him yourselves and crucify Him
 for I find no fault (crime) in Him.","Jesus answered
 You would not have any power or authority whatsoever against (over) Me if it were not given you from above. For this reason the sin and guilt of the one who delivered Me over to you is greater.","Now it was the day of Preparation for the Passover
 and it was about the sixth hour (about twelve o\u2019clock noon). He said to the Jews
 See
 [here is] your King!","So Jesus
 seeing His mother there
 and the disciple whom He loved standing near
 said to His mother
 [Dear] woman
 See
 [here is] your son!","Then He said to the disciple
 See
 [here is] your mother! And from that hour
 the disciple took her into his own [keeping
 own home].","After this
 Jesus
 knowing that all was now finished (ended)
 said in fulfillment of the Scripture
 I thirst.","When Jesus had received the sour wine
 He said
 It is finished! And He bowed His head and gave up His spirit.","So she ran and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple
 whom Jesus [tenderly] loved
 and said to them
 They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb
 and we do not know where they have laid Him!","And they said to her
 Woman
 why are you sobbing? She told them
 Because they have taken away my Lord
 and I do not know where they have laid Him.","Jesus said to her
 Woman
 why are you crying [so]? For Whom are you looking? Supposing that it was the gardener
 she replied
 Sir
 if you carried Him away from here
 tell me where you have put Him and I will take Him away.","Jesus said to her
 Mary! Turning around she said to Him in Hebrew
 Rabboni!\u2014which means Teacher or Master.","Jesus said to her
 Do not cling to Me [do not hold Me]
 for I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to My brethren and tell them
 I am ascending to My Father and your Father
 and to My God and your God.","Then on that same first day of the week
 when it was evening
 though the disciples were behind closed doors for fear of the Jews
 Jesus came and stood among them and said
 Peace to you!","Then Jesus said to them again
 Peace to you! [Just] as the Father has sent Me forth
 so I am sending you.","And having said this
 He breathed on them and said to them
 Receive the Holy Spirit!","[Now having received the Holy Spirit
 and being led and directed by Him] if you forgive the sins of anyone
 they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of anyone
 they are retained.","So the other disciples kept telling him
 We have seen the Lord! But he said to them
 Unless I see in His hands the marks made by the nails and put my finger into the nail prints
 and put my hand into His side
 I will never believe [it].","Eight days later His disciples were again in the house
 and Thomas was with them. Jesus came
 though they were behind closed doors
 and stood among them and said
 Peace to you!","Then He said to Thomas
 Reach out your finger here
 and see My hands; and put out your hand and place [it] in My side. Do not be faithless and incredulous
 but [stop your unbelief and] believe!","Jesus said to him
 Because you have seen Me
 Thomas
 do you now believe (trust
 have faith)? Blessed and happy and to be envied are those who have never seen Me and yet have believed and adhered to and trusted and relied on Me.","So Jesus said to them
 Boys (children)
 you do not have any meat (fish)
 do you? [Have you caught anything to eat along with your bread?] They answered Him
 No!","Jesus said to them
 Bring some of the fish which you have just caught.","Jesus said to them
 Come [and] have breakfast. But none of the disciples ventured or dared to ask Him
 Who are You? because they [well] knew that it was the Lord.","When they had eaten
 Jesus said to Simon Peter
 Simon
 son of John
 do you love Me more than these [others do\u2014with reasoning
 intentional
 spiritual devotion
 as one loves the Father]? He said to Him
 Yes
 Lord
 You know that I love You [that I have deep
 instinctive
 personal affection for You
 as for a close friend]. He said to him
 Feed My lambs.","Again He said to him the second time
 Simon
 son of John
 do you love Me [with reasoning
 intentional
 spiritual devotion
 as one loves the Father]? He said to Him
 Yes
 Lord
 You know that I love You [that I have a deep
 instinctive
 personal affection for You
 as for a close friend]. He said to him
 Shepherd (tend) My sheep.","He said to him the third time
 Simon
 son of John
 do you love Me [with a deep
 instinctive
 personal affection for Me
 as for a close friend]? Peter was grieved (was saddened and hurt) that He should ask him the third time
 Do you love Me? And he said to Him
 Lord
 You know everything; You know that I love You [that I have a deep
 instinctive
 personal affection for You
 as for a close friend]. Jesus said to him
 Feed My sheep.","I assure you
 most solemnly I tell you
 when you were young you girded yourself [put on your own belt or girdle] and you walked about wherever you pleased to go. But when you grow old you will stretch out your hands
 and someone else will put a girdle around you and carry you where you do not wish to go.","He said this to indicate by what kind of death Peter would glorify God. And after this
 He said to him
 Follow Me!","Jesus said to him
 If I want him to stay (survive
 live) until I come
 what is that to you? [What concern is it of yours?] You follow Me!","So word went out among the brethren that this disciple was not going to die; yet Jesus did not say to him that he was not going to die
 but
 If I want him to stay (survive
 live) till I come
 what is that to you?","They asked him
 \u201cThen who are you? Are you Elijah?\u201d John said
 \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d \u201cAre you the prophet?\u201d John answered
 \u201cNo.\u201d","They asked
 \u201cWho are you? We need to give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?\u201d","John replied
 \u201cI am a voice crying out in the wilderness
 Make the Lord\u2019s path straight
 just as the prophet Isaiah said.\u201d","When Jesus turned and saw them following
 he asked
 \u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d They said
 \u201cRabbi (which is translated Teacher)
 where are you staying?\u201d","He replied
 \u201cCome and see.\u201d So they went and saw where he was staying
 and they remained with him that day. It was about four o\u2019clock in the afternoon.","He led him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said
 \u201cYou are Simon
 son of John. You will be called Cephas\u201d (which is translated Peter).","The next day Jesus wanted to go into Galilee
 and he found Philip. Jesus said to him
 \u201cFollow me.\u201d","Philip found Nathanael and said to him
 \u201cWe have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law and the Prophets: Jesus
 Joseph\u2019s son
 from Nazareth.\u201d","Nathanael responded
 \u201cCan anything from Nazareth be good?\u201d Philip said
 \u201cCome and see.\u201d","Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and said about him
 \u201cHere is a genuine Israelite in whom there is no deceit.\u201d","Nathanael asked him
 \u201cHow do you know me?\u201d Jesus answered
 \u201cBefore Philip called you
 I saw you under the fig tree.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cDo you believe because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree? You will see greater things than these!","I assure you that you will see heaven open and God\u2019s angels going up to heaven and down to earth on the Human One.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cWoman
 what does that have to do with me? My time hasn\u2019t come yet.\u201d","Jesus said to the servants
 \u201cFill the jars with water
\u201d and they filled them to the brim.","Then he told them
 \u201cNow draw some from them and take it to the headwaiter
\u201d and they did.","He said to the dove sellers
 \u201cGet these things out of here! Don\u2019t make my Father\u2019s house a place of business.\u201d","Jesus answered

 is baptizing and everyone is flocking to him.\u201d","A Samaritan woman came to the well to draw water. Jesus said to her
 \u201cGive me some water to drink.\u201d","Jesus responded
 \u201cIf you recognized God\u2019s gift and who is saying to you
 \u2018Give me some water to drink
\u2019 you would be asking him and he would give you living water.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cEveryone who drinks this water will be thirsty again
","but whoever drinks from the water that I will give will never be thirsty again. The water that I give will become in those who drink it a spring of water that bubbles up into eternal life.\u201d","The woman said to him
 \u201cSir
 give me this water
 so that I will never be thirsty and will never need to come here to draw water!\u201d","Jesus said to her
 \u201cGo
 get your husband
 and come back here.\u201d","The woman replied
 \u201cI don\u2019t have a husband.\u201d \u201cYou are right to say
 \u2018I don\u2019t have a husband
\u2019\u201d Jesus answered.","\u201cYou\u2019ve had five husbands
 and the man you are with now isn\u2019t your husband. You\u2019ve spoken the truth.\u201d","Jesus said to her
 \u201cBelieve me
 woman
 the time is coming when you and your people will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.","You and your people worship what you don\u2019t know; we worship what we know because salvation is from the Jews.","But the time is coming\u2014and is here!\u2014when true worshippers will worship in spirit and truth. The Father looks for those who worship him this way.","God is spirit
 and it is necessary to worship God in spirit and truth.\u201d","Jesus said to her
 \u201cI Am\u2014the one who speaks with you.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cI have food to eat that you don\u2019t know about.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cI am fed by doing the will of the one who sent me and by completing his work.","Don\u2019t you have a saying
 \u2018Four more months and then it\u2019s time for harvest\u2019? Look
 I tell you: open your eyes and notice that the fields are already ripe for the harvest.","Those who harvest are receiving their pay and gathering fruit for eternal life so that those who sow and those who harvest can celebrate together.","This is a true saying
 that one sows and another harvests.","I have sent you to harvest what you didn\u2019t work hard for; others worked hard
 and you will share in their hard work.\u201d","and they said to the woman
 \u201cWe no longer believe because of what you said
 for we have heard for ourselves and know that this one is truly the savior of the world.\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cUnless you see miraculous signs and wonders
 you won\u2019t believe.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cGo home. Your son lives.\u201d The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and set out for his home.","So he asked them at what time his son had started to get better. And they said
 \u201cThe fever left him yesterday at about one o\u2019clock in the afternoon.\u201d","Then the father realized that this was the hour when Jesus had said to him
 \u201cYour son lives.\u201d And he and his entire household believed in Jesus.","When Jesus saw him lying there
 knowing that he had already been there a long time
 he asked him
 \u201cDo you want to get well?\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cGet up! Pick up your mat and walk.\u201d","He answered
 \u201cThe man who made me well said to me
 \u2018Pick up your mat and walk.\u2019\u201d","Later Jesus found him in the temple and said
 \u201cSee! You have been made well. Don\u2019t sin anymore in case something worse happens to you.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cMy Father is still working
 and I am working too.\u201d","Jesus responded to the Jewish leaders
 \u201cI assure you that the Son can\u2019t do anything by himself except what he sees the Father doing. Whatever the Father does
 the Son does likewise.","The Father loves the Son and shows him everything that he does. He will show him greater works than these so that you will marvel.","As the Father raises the dead and gives life
 so too does the Son give life to whomever he wishes.","The Father doesn\u2019t judge anyone
 but he has given all judgment to the Son","so that everyone will honor the Son just as they honor the Father. Whoever doesn\u2019t honor the Son doesn\u2019t honor the Father who sent him.","\u201cI assure you that whoever hears my word and believes in the one who sent me has eternal life and won\u2019t come under judgment but has passed from death into life.","\u201cI assure you that the time is coming\u2014and is here!\u2014when the dead will hear the voice of God\u2019s Son
 and those who hear it will live.","Just as the Father has life in himself
 so he has granted the Son to have life in himself.","He gives the Son authority to judge
 because he is the Human One.","Don\u2019t be surprised by this
 because the time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice.","Those who did good things will come out into the resurrection of life
 and those who did wicked things into the resurrection of judgment.","I can\u2019t do anything by myself. Whatever I hear
 I judge
 and my judgment is just. I don\u2019t seek my own will but the will of the one who sent me.","\u201cIf I testify about myself
 my testimony isn\u2019t true.","There is someone else who testifies about me
 and I know his testimony about me is true.","You sent a delegation to John
 and he testified to the truth.","Although I don\u2019t accept human testimony
 I say these things so that you can be saved.","John was a burning and shining lamp
 and
 at least for a while
 you were willing to celebrate in his light.","\u201cI have a witness greater than John\u2019s testimony. The Father has given me works to do so that I might complete them. These works I do testify about me that the Father sent me.","And the Father who sent me testifies about me. You have never even heard his voice or seen his form
","and you don\u2019t have his word dwelling with you because you don\u2019t believe the one whom he has sent.","Examine the scriptures
 since you think that in them you have eternal life. They also testify about me
","yet you don\u2019t want to come to me so that you can have life.","\u201cI don\u2019t accept praise from people
","but I know you
 that you don\u2019t have God\u2019s love in you.","I have come in my Father\u2019s name
 and you don\u2019t receive me. If others come in their own name
 you receive them.","How can you believe when you receive praise from each other but don\u2019t seek the praise that comes from the only God?","\u201cDon\u2019t think that I will accuse you before the Father. Your accuser is Moses
 the one in whom your hope rests.","If you believed Moses
 you would believe me
 because Moses wrote about me.","If you don\u2019t believe the writings of Moses
 how will you believe my words?\u201d","Jesus looked up and saw the large crowd coming toward him. He asked Philip
 \u201cWhere will we buy food to feed these people?\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cHave the people sit down.\u201d There was plenty of grass there. They sat down
 about five thousand of them.","When they had plenty to eat
 he said to his disciples
 \u201cGather up the leftover pieces
 so that nothing will be wasted.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cI Am. Don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cI assure you that you are looking for me not because you saw miraculous signs but because you ate all the food you wanted.","Don\u2019t work for the food that doesn\u2019t last but for the food that endures for eternal life
 which the Human One will give you. God the Father has confirmed him as his agent to give life.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cThis is what God requires
 that you believe in him whom God sent.\u201d","Jesus told them
 \u201cI assure you
 it wasn\u2019t Moses who gave the bread from heaven to you
 but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.","The bread of God is the one who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cI am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never go hungry
 and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty.","But I told you that you have seen me and still don\u2019t believe.","Everyone whom the Father gives to me will come to me
 and I won\u2019t send away anyone who comes to me.","I have come down from heaven not to do my will
 but the will of him who sent me.","This is the will of the one who sent me
 that I won\u2019t lose anything he has given me
 but I will raise it up at the last day.","This is my Father\u2019s will: that all who see the Son and believe in him will have eternal life
 and I will raise them up at the last day.\u201d","Jesus responded
 \u201cDon\u2019t grumble among yourselves.","No one can come to me unless they are drawn to me by the Father who sent me
 and I will raise them up at the last day.","It is written in the Prophets
 And they will all be taught by God. Everyone who has listened to the Father and learned from him comes to me.","No one has seen the Father except the one who is from God. He has seen the Father.","I assure you
 whoever believes has eternal life.","I am the bread of life.","Your ancestors ate manna in the wilderness and they died.","This is the bread that comes down from heaven so that whoever eats from it will never die.","I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Whoever eats this bread will live forever
 and the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cI assure you
 unless you eat the flesh of the Human One and drink his blood
 you have no life in you.","Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life
 and I will raise them up at the last day.","My flesh is true food and my blood is true drink.","Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me and I in them.","As the living Father sent me
 and I live because of the Father
 so whoever eats me lives because of me.","This is the bread that came down from heaven. It isn\u2019t like the bread your ancestors ate
 and then they died. Whoever eats this bread will live forever.\u201d","Jesus knew that the disciples were grumbling about this and he said to them
 \u201cDoes this offend you?","What if you were to see the Human One going up where he was before?","The Spirit is the one who gives life and the flesh doesn\u2019t help at all. The words I have spoken to you are spirit and life.","Yet some of you don\u2019t believe.\u201dJesus knew from the beginning who wouldn\u2019t believe and the one who would betray him.","He said
 \u201cFor this reason I said to you that none can come to me unless the Father enables them to do so.\u201d","Jesus asked the Twelve
 \u201cDo you also want to leave?\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cDidn\u2019t I choose you twelve? Yet one of you is a devil.\u201d","Jesus\u2019 brothers said to him
 \u201cLeave Galilee. Go to Judea so that your disciples can see the amazing works that you do.","Jesus replied
 \u201cFor you
 anytime is fine. But my time hasn\u2019t come yet.","The world can\u2019t hate you. It hates me
 though
 because I testify that its works are evil.","You go up to the festival. I\u2019m not going to this one because my time hasn\u2019t yet come.\u201d","Jesus responded
 \u201cMy teaching isn\u2019t mine but comes from the one who sent me.","Whoever wants to do God\u2019s will can tell whether my teaching is from God or whether I speak on my own.","Those who speak on their own seek glory for themselves. Those who seek the glory of him who sent me are people of truth; there\u2019s no falsehood in them.","Didn\u2019t Moses give you the Law? Yet none of you keep the Law. Why do you want to kill me?\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cI did one work
 and you were all astonished.","Because Moses gave you the commandment about circumcision (although it wasn\u2019t Moses but the patriarchs)
 you circumcise a man on the Sabbath.","If a man can be circumcised on the Sabbath without breaking Moses\u2019 Law
 why are you angry with me because I made an entire man well on the Sabbath?","Don\u2019t judge according to appearances. Judge with right judgment.\u201d","Some people from Jerusalem said
 \u201cIsn\u2019t he the one they want to kill?","While Jesus was teaching in the temple
 he exclaimed
 \u201cYou know me and where I am from. I haven\u2019t come on my own. The one who sent me is true
 and you don\u2019t know him.","I know him because I am from him and he sent me.\u201d","Therefore
 Jesus said
 \u201cI\u2019m still with you for a little while before I go to the one who sent me.","You will look for me
 but you won\u2019t find me
 and where I am you can\u2019t come.\u201d","The Jewish opposition asked each other
 \u201cWhere does he intend to go that we can\u2019t find him? Surely he doesn\u2019t intend to go where our people have been scattered and are living among the Greeks! He isn\u2019t going to teach the Greeks
 is he?","On the last and most important day of the festival
 Jesus stood up and shouted
 \u201cAll who are thirsty should come to me!","All who believe in me should drink! As the scriptures said concerning me
  Rivers of living water will flow out from within him.\u201d","Jesus said this concerning the Spirit. Those who believed in him would soon receive the Spirit
 but they hadn\u2019t experienced the Spirit yet since Jesus hadn\u2019t yet been glorified.","they said to Jesus
 \u201cTeacher
 this woman was caught in the act of committing adultery.","They continued to question him
 so he stood up and replied
 \u201cWhoever hasn\u2019t sinned should throw the first stone.\u201d","Jesus stood up and said to her
 \u201cWoman
 where are they? Is there no one to condemn you?\u201d","She said
 \u201cNo one
 sir.\u201d Jesus said
 \u201cNeither do I condemn you. Go
 and from now on
 don\u2019t sin anymore.\u201d","Jesus spoke to the people again
 saying
 \u201cI am the light of the world. Whoever follows me won\u2019t walk in darkness but will have the light of life.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cEven if I testify about myself
 my testimony is true
 since I know where I came from and where I\u2019m going. You don\u2019t know where I come from or where I\u2019m going.","You judge according to human standards
 but I judge no one.","Even if I do judge
 my judgment is truthful
 because I\u2019m not alone. My judgments come from me and from the Father who sent me.","In your Law it is written that the witness of two people is true.","I am one witness concerning myself
 and the Father who sent me is the other.\u201d","They asked him
 \u201cWhere is your Father?\u201d Jesus answered
 \u201cYou don\u2019t know me and you don\u2019t know my Father. If you knew me
 you would also know my Father.\u201d","Jesus continued
 \u201cI\u2019m going away. You will look for me
 and you will die in your sin. Where I\u2019m going
 you can\u2019t come.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cYou are from below; I\u2019m from above. You are from this world; I\u2019m not from this world.","This is why I told you that you would die in your sins. If you don\u2019t believe that I Am
 you will die in your sins.\u201d","\u201cWho are you?\u201d they asked. Jesus replied
 \u201cI\u2019m exactly who I have claimed to be from the beginning.","I have many things to say in judgment concerning you. The one who sent me is true
 and what I have heard from him I tell the world.\u201d","So Jesus said to them
 \u201cWhen the Human One is lifted up
 then you will know that I Am. Then you will know that I do nothing on my own
 but I say just what the Father has taught me.","He who sent me is with me. He doesn\u2019t leave me by myself
 because I always do what makes him happy.\u201d","Jesus said to the Jews who believed in him
 \u201cYou are truly my disciples if you remain faithful to my teaching.","Then you will know the truth
 and the truth will set you free.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cI assure you that everyone who sins is a slave to sin.","A slave isn\u2019t a permanent member of the household
 but a son is.","Therefore
 if the Son makes you free
 you really will be free.","I know that you are Abraham\u2019s children
 yet you want to kill me because you don\u2019t welcome my teaching.","I\u2019m telling you what I\u2019ve seen when I am with the Father
 but you are doing what you\u2019ve heard from your father.\u201d","They replied
 \u201cOur father is Abraham.\u201d Jesus responded
 \u201cIf you were Abraham\u2019s children
 you would do Abraham\u2019s works.","Instead
 you want to kill me
 though I am the one who has spoken the truth I heard from God. Abraham didn\u2019t do this.","You are doing your father\u2019s works.\u201d They said
 \u201cOur ancestry isn\u2019t in question! The only Father we have is God!\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cIf God were your Father
 you would love me
 for I came from God. Here I am. I haven\u2019t come on my own. God sent me.","Why don\u2019t you understand what I\u2019m saying? It\u2019s because you can\u2019t really hear my words.","Your father is the devil. You are his children
 and you want to do what your father wants. He was a murderer from the beginning. He has never stood for the truth
 because there\u2019s no truth in him. Whenever that liar speaks
 he speaks according to his own nature
 because he\u2019s a liar and the father of liars.","Because I speak the truth
 you don\u2019t believe me.","Who among you can show I\u2019m guilty of sin? Since I speak the truth
 why don\u2019t you believe me?","God\u2019s children listen to God\u2019s words. You don\u2019t listen to me because you aren\u2019t God\u2019s children.\u201d","\u201cI don\u2019t have a demon
\u201d Jesus replied. \u201cBut I honor my Father and you dishonor me.","I\u2019m not trying to bring glory to myself. There\u2019s one who is seeking to glorify me
 and he\u2019s the judge.","I assure you that whoever keeps my word will never die.\u201d","The Jewish opposition said to Jesus
 \u201cNow we know that you have a demon. Abraham and the prophets died
 yet you say
 \u2018Whoever keeps my word will never die.\u2019","Jesus answered
 \u201cIf I glorify myself
 my glory is meaningless. My Father
 who you say is your God
 is the one who glorifies me.","You don\u2019t know him
 but I do. If I said I didn\u2019t know him
 I would be like you
 a liar. But I do know him
 and I keep his word.","Your father Abraham was overjoyed that he would see my day. He saw it and was happy.\u201d","\u201cI assure you
\u201d Jesus replied
 \u201cbefore Abraham was
 I Am.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cNeither he nor his parents. This happened so that God\u2019s mighty works might be displayed in him.","While it\u2019s daytime
 we must do the works of him who sent me. Night is coming when no one can work.","While I am in the world
 I am the light of the world.\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cGo
 wash in the pool of Siloam\u201d (this word means sent). So the man went away and washed. When he returned
 he could see.","He answered
 \u201cThe man they call Jesus made mud
 smeared it on my eyes
 and said
 \u2018Go to the pool of Siloam and wash.\u2019 So I went and washed
 and then I could see.\u201d","They asked
 \u201cWhere is this man?\u201d He replied
 \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d","Therefore
 they called a second time for the man who had been born blind and said to him
 \u201cGive glory to God. We know this man is a sinner.\u201d","The man answered
 \u201cI don\u2019t know whether he\u2019s a sinner. Here\u2019s what I do know: I was blind and now I see.\u201d","They questioned him: \u201cWhat did he do to you? How did he heal your eyes?\u201d","He replied
 \u201cI already told you
 and you didn\u2019t listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his disciples too?\u201d","Jesus heard they had expelled the man born blind. Finding him
 Jesus said
 \u201cDo you believe in the Human One?\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cYou have seen him. In fact
 he is the one speaking with you.\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cI have come into the world to exercise judgment so that those who don\u2019t see can see and those who see will become blind.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cIf you were blind
 you wouldn\u2019t have any sin
 but now that you say
 \u2018We see
\u2019 your sin remains.","I assure you that whoever doesn\u2019t enter into the sheep pen through the gate but climbs over the wall is a thief and an outlaw.","The one who enters through the gate is the shepherd of the sheep.","The guard at the gate opens the gate for him
 and the sheep listen to his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.","Whenever he has gathered all of his sheep
 he goes before them and they follow him
 because they know his voice.","They won\u2019t follow a stranger but will run away because they don\u2019t know the stranger\u2019s voice.\u201d","So Jesus spoke again
 \u201cI assure you that I am the gate of the sheep.","All who came before me were thieves and outlaws
 but the sheep didn\u2019t listen to them.","I am the gate. Whoever enters through me will be saved. They will come in and go out and find pasture.","The thief enters only to steal
 kill
 and destroy. I came so that they could have life\u2014indeed
 so that they could live life to the fullest.","\u201cI am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.","When the hired hand sees the wolf coming
 he leaves the sheep and runs away. That\u2019s because he isn\u2019t the shepherd; the sheep aren\u2019t really his. So the wolf attacks the sheep and scatters them.","He\u2019s only a hired hand and the sheep don\u2019t matter to him.","\u201cI am the good shepherd. I know my own sheep and they know me
","just as the Father knows me and I know the Father. I give up my life for the sheep.","I have other sheep that don\u2019t belong to this sheep pen. I must lead them too. They will listen to my voice and there will be one flock
 with one shepherd.","\u201cThis is why the Father loves me: I give up my life so that I can take it up again.","No one takes it from me
 but I give it up because I want to. I have the right to give it up
 and I have the right to take it up again. I received this commandment from my Father.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cI have told you
 but you don\u2019t believe. The works I do in my Father\u2019s name testify about me
","but you don\u2019t believe because you don\u2019t belong to my sheep.","My sheep listen to my voice. I know them and they follow me.","I give them eternal life. They will never die
 and no one will snatch them from my hand.","My Father
 who has given them to me
 is greater than all
 and no one is able to snatch them from my Father\u2019s hand.","I and the Father are one.\u201d","Jesus responded
 \u201cI have shown you many good works from the Father. For which of those works do you stone me?\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cIsn\u2019t it written in your Law
 I have said
 you are gods?","Scripture calls those to whom God\u2019s word came gods
 and scripture can\u2019t be abolished.","So how can you say that the one whom the Father has made holy and sent into the world insults God because he said
 \u2018I am God\u2019s Son\u2019?","If I don\u2019t do the works of my Father
 don\u2019t believe me.","But if I do them
 and you don\u2019t believe me
 believe the works so that you can know and recognize that the Father is in me and I am in the Father.\u201d","When he heard this
 Jesus said
 \u201cThis illness isn\u2019t fatal. It\u2019s for the glory of God so that God\u2019s Son can be glorified through it.\u201d","he said to his disciples
 \u201cLet\u2019s return to Judea again.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cAren\u2019t there twelve hours in the day? Whoever walks in the day doesn\u2019t stumble because they see the light of the world.","But whoever walks in the night does stumble because the light isn\u2019t in them.\u201d","He continued
 \u201cOur friend Lazarus is sleeping
 but I am going in order to wake him up.\u201d","Jesus told them plainly
 \u201cLazarus has died.","For your sakes
 I\u2019m glad I wasn\u2019t there so that you can believe. Let\u2019s go to him.\u201d","Then Thomas (the one called Didymus) said to the other disciples
 \u201cLet us go too so that we may die with Jesus.\u201d","Jesus told her
 \u201cYour brother will rise again.\u201d","Jesus said to her
 \u201cI am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me will live

 \u201cYes

 she fell at his feet and said
 \u201cLord

 \u201cWhere have you laid him?\u201d They replied
 \u201cLord
 come and see.\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cRemove the stone.\u201d Martha
 the sister of the dead man
 said
 \u201cLord
 the smell will be awful! He\u2019s been dead four days.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you that if you believe
 you will see God\u2019s glory?\u201d","So they removed the stone. Jesus looked up and said
 \u201cFather
 thank you for hearing me.","I know you always hear me. I say this for the benefit of the crowd standing here so that they will believe that you sent me.\u201d","Having said this
 Jesus shouted with a loud voice
 \u201cLazarus
 come out!\u201d","The dead man came out
 his feet bound and his hands tied
 and his face covered with a cloth. Jesus said to them
 \u201cUntie him and let him go.\u201d","Then Jesus said
 \u201cLeave her alone. This perfume was to be used in preparation for my burial
 and this is how she has used it.","You will always have the poor among you
 but you won\u2019t always have me.\u201d","The crowd who had been with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead were testifying about him.","Therefore
 the Pharisees said to each other
 \u201cSee! You\u2019ve accomplished nothing! Look! The whole world is following him!\u201d","They came to Philip
 who was from Bethsaida in Galilee
 and made a request: \u201cSir
 we want to see Jesus.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cThe time has come for the Human One to be glorified.","I assure you that unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies
 it can only be a single seed. But if it dies
 it bears much fruit.","Those who love their lives will lose them
 and those who hate their lives in this world will keep them forever.","Whoever serves me must follow me. Wherever I am
 there my servant will also be. My Father will honor whoever serves me.","\u201cNow I am deeply troubled. What should I say? \u2018Father
 save me from this time\u2019? No
 for this is the reason I have come to this time.","Father
 glorify your name!\u201d Then a voice came from heaven
 \u201cI have glorified it
 and I will glorify it again.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cThis voice wasn\u2019t for my benefit but for yours.","Now is the time for judgment of this world. Now this world\u2019s ruler will be thrown out.","When I am lifted up from the earth
 I will draw everyone to me.\u201d (","Jesus replied
 \u201cThe light is with you for only a little while. Walk while you have the light so that darkness doesn\u2019t overtake you. Those who walk in the darkness don\u2019t know where they are going.","As long as you have the light
 believe in the light so that you might become people whose lives are determined by the light.\u201d After Jesus said these things
 he went away and hid from them.","Jesus shouted
 \u201cWhoever believes in me doesn\u2019t believe in me but in the one who sent me.","Whoever sees me sees the one who sent me.","I have come as a light into the world so that everyone who believes in me won\u2019t live in darkness.","If people hear my words and don\u2019t keep them
 I don\u2019t judge them. I didn\u2019t come to judge the world but to save it.","Whoever rejects me and doesn\u2019t receive my words will be judged at the last day by the word I have spoken.","I don\u2019t speak on my own
 but the Father who sent me commanded me regarding what I should speak and say.","I know that his commandment is eternal life. Therefore
 whatever I say is just as the Father has said to me.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cYou don\u2019t understand what I\u2019m doing now
 but you will understand later.\u201d","\u201cNo!\u201d Peter said. \u201cYou will never wash my feet!\u201d Jesus replied
 \u201cUnless I wash you
 you won\u2019t have a place with me.\u201d","Jesus responded
 \u201cThose who have bathed need only to have their feet washed
 because they are completely clean. You disciples are clean
 but not every one of you.\u201d","He knew who would betray him. That\u2019s why he said
 \u201cNot every one of you is clean.\u201d","After he washed the disciples\u2019 feet
 he put on his robes and returned to his place at the table. He said to them

 because I am.","If I
 your Lord and teacher
 have washed your feet
 you too must wash each other\u2019s feet.","I have given you an example: Just as I have done
 you also must do.","I assure you
 servants aren\u2019t greater than their master
 nor are those who are sent greater than the one who sent them.","Since you know these things
 you will be happy if you do them.","I\u2019m not speaking about all of you. I know those whom I\u2019ve chosen. But this is to fulfill the scripture
 The one who eats my bread has turned against me.","\u201cI\u2019m telling you this now
 before it happens
 so that when it does happen you will believe that I Am.","I assure you that whoever receives someone I send receives me
 and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me.\u201d","After he said these things
 Jesus was deeply disturbed and testified
 \u201cI assure you
 one of you will betray me.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cIt\u2019s the one to whom I will give this piece of bread once I have dipped into the bowl.\u201dThen he dipped the piece of bread and gave it to Judas
 Simon Iscariot\u2019s son.","After Judas took the bread
 Satan entered into him. Jesus told him
 \u201cWhat you are about to do
 do quickly.\u201d","When Judas was gone
 Jesus said
 \u201cNow the Human One has been glorified
 and God has been glorified in him.","If God has been glorified in him
 God will also glorify the Human One in himself and will glorify him immediately.","Little children
 I\u2019m with you for a little while longer. You will look for me\u2014but

 I also tell you now\u2014\u2018Where I\u2019m going
 you can\u2019t come.\u2019","\u201cI give you a new commandment: Love each other. Just as I have loved you
 so you also must love each other.","This is how everyone will know that you are my disciples

 \u201cLord
 where are you going?\u201d Jesus answered
 \u201cWhere I am going
 you can\u2019t follow me now

 \u201cWill you give up your life for me? I assure you that you will deny me three times before the rooster crows.","\u201cDon\u2019t be troubled. Trust in God. Trust also in me.","My Father\u2019s house has room to spare. If that weren\u2019t the case
 would I have told you that I\u2019m going to prepare a place for you?","When I go to prepare a place for you
 I will return and take you to be with me so that where I am you will be too.","You know the way to the place I\u2019m going.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cI am the way
 the truth
 and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.","If you have really known me
 you will also know the Father. From now on you know him and have seen him.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cDon\u2019t you know me

 \u2018Show us the Father\u2019?","Don\u2019t you believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words I have spoken to you I don\u2019t speak on my own. The Father who dwells in me does his works.","Trust me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in me
 or at least believe on account of the works themselves.","I assure you that whoever believes in me will do the works that I do. They will do even greater works than these because I am going to the Father.","I will do whatever you ask for in my name
 so that the Father can be glorified in the Son.","When you ask me for anything in my name
 I will do it.","\u201cIf you love me
 you will keep my commandments.","I will ask the Father
 and he will send another Companion
 who will be with you forever.","This Companion is the Spirit of Truth
 whom the world can\u2019t receive because it neither sees him nor recognizes him. You know him
 because he lives with you and will be with you.","\u201cI won\u2019t leave you as orphans. I will come to you.","Soon the world will no longer see me
 but you will see me. Because I live
 you will live too.","On that day you will know that I am in my Father
 you are in me
 and I am in you.","Whoever has my commandments and keeps them loves me. Whoever loves me will be loved by my Father
 and I will love them and reveal myself to them.\u201d","Judas (not Judas Iscariot) asked
 \u201cLord
 why are you about to reveal yourself to us and not to the world?\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cWhoever loves me will keep my word. My Father will love them
 and we will come to them and make our home with them.","Whoever doesn\u2019t love me doesn\u2019t keep my words. The word that you hear isn\u2019t mine. It is the word of the Father who sent me.","\u201cI have spoken these things to you while I am with you.","The Companion
 the Holy Spirit

 \u2018I\u2019m going away and returning to you.\u2019 If you loved me
 you would be happy that I am going to the Father
 because the Father is greater than me.","I have told you before it happens so that when it happens you will believe.","I won\u2019t say much more to you because this world\u2019s ruler is coming. He has nothing on me.","Rather
 he comes so that the world will know that I love the Father and do just as the Father has commanded me. Get up. We\u2019re leaving this place.","\u201cI am the true vine
 and my Father is the vineyard keeper.","He removes any of my branches that don\u2019t produce fruit
 and he trims any branch that produces fruit so that it will produce even more fruit.","You are already trimmed because of the word I have spoken to you.","Remain in me
 and I will remain in you. A branch can\u2019t produce fruit by itself
 but must remain in the vine. Likewise
 you can\u2019t produce fruit unless you remain in me.","I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you
 then you will produce much fruit. Without me
 you can\u2019t do anything.","If you don\u2019t remain in me
 you will be like a branch that is thrown out and dries up. Those branches are gathered up
 thrown into a fire
 and burned.","If you remain in me and my words remain in you
 ask for whatever you want and it will be done for you.","My Father is glorified when you produce much fruit and in this way prove that you are my disciples.","\u201cAs the Father loved me
 I too have loved you. Remain in my love.","If you keep my commandments
 you will remain in my love
 just as I kept my Father\u2019s commandments and remain in his love.","I have said these things to you so that my joy will be in you and your joy will be complete.","This is my commandment: love each other just as I have loved you.","No one has greater love than to give up one\u2019s life for one\u2019s friends.","You are my friends if you do what I command you.","I don\u2019t call you servants any longer
 because servants don\u2019t know what their master is doing. Instead
 I call you friends
 because everything I heard from my Father I have made known to you.","You didn\u2019t choose me
 but I chose you and appointed you so that you could go and produce fruit and so that your fruit could last. As a result
 whatever you ask the Father in my name
 he will give you.","I give you these commandments so that you can love each other.","\u201cIf the world hates you
 know that it hated me first.","If you belonged to the world
 the world would love you as its own. However
 I have chosen you out of the world
 and you don\u2019t belong to the world. This is why the world hates you.","Remember what I told you
 \u2018Servants aren\u2019t greater than their master.\u2019 If the world harassed me
 it will harass you too. If it kept my word
 it will also keep yours.","The world will do all these things to you on account of my name
 because it doesn\u2019t know the one who sent me.","\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t come and spoken to the people of this world
 they wouldn\u2019t be sinners. But now they have no excuse for their sin.","Whoever hates me also hates the Father.","If I hadn\u2019t done works among them that no one else had done
 they wouldn\u2019t be sinners. But now they have seen and hated both me and my Father.","This fulfills the word written in their Law
 They hated me without a reason.","\u201cWhen the Companion comes
 whom I will send from the Father\u2014the Spirit of Truth who proceeds from the Father\u2014he will testify about me.","You will testify too
 because you have been with me from the beginning.","I have said these things to you so that you won\u2019t fall away.","They will expel you from the synagogue. The time is coming when those who kill you will think that they are doing a service to God.","They will do these things because they don\u2019t know the Father or me.","But I have said these things to you so that when their time comes
 you will remember that I told you about them. \u201cI didn\u2019t say these things to you from the beginning
 because I was with you.","But now I go away to the one who sent me. None of you ask me
 \u2018Where are you going?\u2019","Yet because I have said these things to you
 you are filled with sorrow.","I assure you that it is better for you that I go away. If I don\u2019t go away
 the Companion won\u2019t come to you. But if I go
 I will send him to you.","When he comes
 he will show the world it was wrong about sin
 righteousness
 and judgment.","He will show the world it was wrong about sin because they don\u2019t believe in me.","He will show the world it was wrong about righteousness because I\u2019m going to the Father and you won\u2019t see me anymore.","He will show the world it was wrong about judgment because this world\u2019s ruler stands condemned.","\u201cI have much more to say to you
 but you can\u2019t handle it now.","However
 when the Spirit of Truth comes
 he will guide you in all truth. He won\u2019t speak on his own
 but will say whatever he hears and will proclaim to you what is to come.","He will glorify me
 because he will take what is mine and proclaim it to you.","Everything that the Father has is mine. That\u2019s why I said that the Spirit takes what is mine and will proclaim it to you.","Soon you won\u2019t be able to see me; soon after that
 you will see me.\u201d","Some of Jesus\u2019 disciples said to each other
 \u201cWhat does he mean: \u2018Soon you won\u2019t see me
 and soon after that you will see me\u2019 and \u2018Because I\u2019m going to the Father\u2019?","What does he mean by \u2018soon\u2019? We don\u2019t understand what he\u2019s talking about.\u201d","Jesus knew they wanted to ask him
 so he said
 \u201cAre you trying to find out from each other what I meant when I said
 \u2018Soon you won\u2019t see me
 and soon after that you will see me\u2019?","I assure you that you will cry and lament
 and the world will be happy. You will be sorrowful
 but your sorrow will turn into joy.","When a woman gives birth
 she has pain because her time has come. But when the child is born
 she no longer remembers her distress because of her joy that a child has been born into the world.","In the same way
 you have sorrow now; but I will see you again
 and you will be overjoyed. No one takes away your joy.","In that day
 you won\u2019t ask me anything. I assure you that the Father will give you whatever you ask in my name.","Up to now
 you have asked nothing in my name. Ask and you will receive so that your joy will be complete.","\u201cI\u2019ve been using figures of speech with you. The time is coming when I will no longer speak to you in such analogies. Instead
 I will tell you plainly about the Father.","In that day you will ask in my name. I\u2019m not saying that I will ask the Father on your behalf.","The Father himself loves you
 because you have loved me and believed that I came from God.","I left the Father and came into the world. I tell you again: I am leaving the world and returning to the Father.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cNow you believe?","Look! A time is coming\u2014and is here!\u2014when each of you will be scattered to your own homes and you will leave me alone. I\u2019m not really alone
 for the Father is with me.","I\u2019ve said these things to you so that you will have peace in me. In the world you have distress. But be encouraged! I have conquered the world.\u201d","When Jesus finished saying these things
 he looked up to heaven and said
 \u201cFather
 the time has come. Glorify your Son
 so that the Son can glorify you.","You gave him authority over everyone so that he could give eternal life to everyone you gave him.","This is eternal life: to know you
 the only true God
 and Jesus Christ whom you sent.","I have glorified you on earth by finishing the work you gave me to do.","Now
 Father
 glorify me in your presence with the glory I shared with you before the world was created.","\u201cI have revealed your name to the people you gave me from this world. They were yours and you gave them to me
 and they have kept your word.","Now they know that everything you have given me comes from you.","This is because I gave them the words that you gave me
 and they received them. They truly understood that I came from you
 and they believed that you sent me.","\u201cI\u2019m praying for them. I\u2019m not praying for the world but for those you gave me
 because they are yours.","Everything that is mine is yours and everything that is yours is mine; I have been glorified in them.","I\u2019m no longer in the world
 but they are in the world

 watch over them in your name
 the name you gave me

 I watched over them in your name
 the name you gave to me

 except the one who was destined for destruction
 so that scripture would be fulfilled.","Now I\u2019m coming to you and I say these things while I\u2019m in the world so that they can share completely in my joy.","I gave your word to them and the world hated them
 because they don\u2019t belong to this world
 just as I don\u2019t belong to this world.","I\u2019m not asking that you take them out of this world but that you keep them safe from the evil one.","They don\u2019t belong to this world
 just as I don\u2019t belong to this world.","Make them holy in the truth; your word is truth.","As you sent me into the world
 so I have sent them into the world.","I made myself holy on their behalf so that they also would be made holy in the truth.","\u201cI\u2019m not praying only for them but also for those who believe in me because of their word.","I pray they will be one
 Father
 just as you are in me and I am in you. I pray that they also will be in us

 you know everything; you know I love you.\u201d Jesus said to him
 \u201cFeed my sheep.","I assure you that when you were younger you tied your own belt and walked around wherever you wanted. When you grow old
 you will stretch out your hands and another will tie your belt and lead you where you don\u2019t want to go.\u201d","He said this to show the kind of death by which Peter would glorify God. After saying this
 Jesus said to Peter
 \u201cFollow me.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cIf I want him to remain until I come
 what difference does that make to you? You must follow me.\u201d","Therefore
 the word spread among the brothers and sisters that this disciple wouldn\u2019t die. However
 Jesus didn\u2019t say he wouldn\u2019t die
 but only
 \u201cIf I want him to remain until I come
 what difference does that make to you?\u201d","Then when they asked him if he were Elijah
 he said
 \u201cNo
 I am not!\u201d And when they asked if he were the Prophet
 he also said \u201cNo!\u201d","Finally
 they said
 \u201cWho are you then? We have to give an answer to the ones who sent us. Tell us who you are!\u201d","John answered in the words of the prophet Isaiah

 he asked
 \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d They answered

 \u201cCome and see!\u201d It was already about four o\u2019clock in the afternoon when they went with him and saw where he lived. So they stayed on for the rest of the day.","Andrew brought his brother to Jesus. And when Jesus saw him
 he said
 \u201cSimon son of John
 you will be called Cephas.\u201d This name can be translated as \u201cPeter.\u201d","The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee. There he met Philip
 who was from Bethsaida
 the hometown of Andrew and Peter. Jesus said to Philip
 \u201cCome with me.\u201d","Philip then found Nathanael and said
 \u201cWe have found the one that Moses and the Prophets wrote about. He is Jesus

 \u201cBefore Philip called you

 God will save the world. ","But a time is coming

 \u201cThe man who healed me told me to pick up my mat and walk.\u201d","Later
 Jesus met the man in the temple and told him
 \u201cYou are now well. But don\u2019t sin anymore or something worse might happen to you.\u201d ","But Jesus said
 \u201cMy Father has never stopped working
 and that is why I keep on working.\u201d ","Jesus told the people: I tell you for certain that the Son cannot do anything on his own. He can do only what he sees the Father doing
 and he does exactly what he sees the Father do. ","The Father loves the Son and has shown him everything he does. The Father will show him even greater things
 and you will be amazed. ","Just as the Father raises the dead and gives life
 so the Son gives life to anyone he wants to.","The Father doesn\u2019t judge anyone
 but he has made his Son the judge of everyone. ","The Father wants all people to honor the Son as much as they honor him. When anyone refuses to honor the Son
 that is the same as refusing to honor the Father who sent him. ","I tell you for certain that everyone who hears my message and has faith in the one who sent me has eternal life and will never be condemned. They have already gone from death to life.","I tell you for certain that the time will come
 and it is already here
 when all of the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God. And those who listen to it will live! ","The Father has the power to give life

 because he is the Son of Man.","Don\u2019t be surprised! The time will come when all of the dead will hear the voice of the Son of Man
 ","and they will come out of their graves. Everyone who has done good things will rise to life

 and he is the one who told me how to judge. I judge with fairness
 because I obey him
 and I don\u2019t just try to please myself.","If I speak for myself
 there is no way to prove I am telling the truth. ","But there is someone else who speaks for me
 and I know what he says is true. ","You sent messengers to John
 and he told them the truth. ","I don\u2019t depend on what people say about me
 but I tell you these things so that you may be saved. ","John was a lamp that gave a lot of light
 and you were glad to enjoy his light for a while.","But something more important than John speaks for me. I mean the things that the Father has given me to do! All of these speak for me and prove that the Father sent me.","The Father who sent me also speaks for me
 but you have never heard his voice or seen him face to face. ","You have not believed his message
 because you refused to have faith in the one he sent.","You search the Scriptures
 because you think you will find eternal life in them. The Scriptures tell about me
 ","but you refuse to come to me for eternal life.","I don\u2019t care about human praise
 ","but I do know that none of you love God.","I have come with my Father\u2019s authority
 and you have not welcomed me. But you will welcome people who come on their own. ","How could you possibly believe? You like to have your friends praise you
 and you don\u2019t care about praise that the only God can give!","Don\u2019t think that I will be the one to accuse you to the Father. You have put your hope in Moses
 yet he is the very one who will accuse you. ","Moses wrote about me
 and if you had believed Moses
 you would have believed me. ","But if you don\u2019t believe what Moses wrote
 how can you believe what I say?","When Jesus saw the large crowd coming toward him
 he asked Philip
 \u201cWhere will we get enough food to feed all these people?\u201d ","The ground was covered with grass
 and Jesus told his disciples to have everyone sit down. About five thousand men were in the crowd. ","The people ate all they wanted

 \u201cGod wants you to have faith in the one he sent.\u201d","Jesus then told them
 \u201cI tell you for certain that Moses wasn\u2019t the one who gave you bread from heaven. My Father is the one who gives you the true bread from heaven. ","And the bread that God gives is the one who came down from heaven to give life to the world.\u201d","Jesus replied: I am the bread that gives life! No one who comes to me will ever be hungry. No one who has faith in me will ever be thirsty.","I have told you already that you have seen me and still do not have faith in me.","Everything and everyone that the Father has given me will come to me
 and I won\u2019t turn any of them away.","I didn\u2019t come from heaven to do what I want! I came to do what the Father wants me to do. He sent me
 ","and he wants to make certain that none of the ones he has given me will be lost. Instead
 he wants me to raise them to life on the last day. ","My Father wants everyone who sees the Son to have faith in him and to have eternal life. Then I will raise them to life on the last day.","Jesus told them: Stop grumbling!","No one can come to me
 unless the Father who sent me makes them want to come. But if they do come
 I will raise them to life on the last day. ","One of the prophets wrote
 \u201cGod will teach all of them.\u201d And so everyone who listens to the Father and learns from him will come to me.","The only one who has seen the Father is the one who has come from him. No one else has ever seen the Father.","I tell you for certain that everyone who has faith in me has eternal life.","I am the bread that gives life!","Your ancestors ate manna in the desert
 and later they died. ","But the bread from heaven has come down
 so that no one who eats it will ever die. ","I am that bread from heaven! Everyone who eats it will live forever. My flesh is the life-giving bread that I give to the people of this world.","Jesus answered: I tell you for certain that you won\u2019t live unless you eat the flesh and drink the blood of the Son of Man.","But if you do eat my flesh and drink my blood
 you will have eternal life
 and I will raise you to life on the last day. ","My flesh is the true food
 and my blood is the true drink. ","If you eat my flesh and drink my blood
 you are one with me
 and I am one with you.","The living Father sent me
 and I have life because of him. Now everyone who eats my flesh will live because of me. ","The bread that comes down from heaven isn\u2019t like what your ancestors ate. They died
 but whoever eats this bread will live forever.","Jesus knew that his disciples were grumbling. So he asked
 \u201cDoes this bother you? ","What if you should see the Son of Man go up to heaven where he came from?","The Spirit is the one who gives life! Human strength can do nothing. The words that I have spoken to you are from that life-giving Spirit.","But some of you refuse to have faith in me.\u201d Jesus said this
 because from the beginning he knew who would have faith in him. He also knew which one would betray him.","Then Jesus said
 \u201cYou cannot come to me
 unless the Father makes you want to come. That is why I have told these things to all of you.\u201d","Jesus then asked his twelve disciples if they were going to leave him.","Jesus told his disciples
 \u201cI chose all twelve of you
 but one of you is a demon!\u201d ","and Jesus' brothers said to him
 \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go to Judea? Then your disciples can see what you are doing. ","Jesus answered
 \u201cMy time hasn\u2019t yet come
 but your time is always here. ","The people of this world cannot hate you. They hate me
 because I tell them that they do evil things. ","Go on to the festival. My time hasn\u2019t yet come
 and I am not going.\u201d ","Jesus replied: I am not teaching something that I thought up. What I teach comes from the one who sent me.","If you really want to obey God
 you will know if what I teach comes from God or from me. ","If I wanted to bring honor to myself
 I would speak for myself. But I want to honor the one who sent me. That is why I tell the truth and not a lie. ","Didn\u2019t Moses give you the Law? Yet none of you obey it! So why do you want to kill me?","Jesus answered: I worked one miracle
 and it amazed you. ","Moses commanded you to circumcise your sons. But it wasn\u2019t really Moses who gave you this command. It was your ancestors
 and even on the Sabbath you circumcise your sons ","in order to obey the Law of Moses. Why are you angry with me for making someone completely well on the Sabbath?","Don\u2019t judge by appearances. Judge by what is right.","Some of the people from Jerusalem were saying
 \u201cIsn\u2019t this the man they want to kill? ","As Jesus was teaching in the temple
 he shouted
 \u201cDo you really think you know me and where I came from? I didn\u2019t come on my own! The one who sent me is truthful
 and you don\u2019t know him. ","But I know the one who sent me
 because I came from him.\u201d","But Jesus told them
 \u201cI will be with you a little while longer
 and then I will return to the one who sent me. ","You will look for me
 but you won\u2019t find me. You cannot go where I am going.\u201d","The Jewish leaders asked each other
 \u201cWhere can he go to keep us from finding him? Is he going to some foreign country where our people live? Is he going there to teach the Greeks? ","On the last and most important day of the festival
 Jesus stood up and shouted
 \u201cIf you are thirsty
 come to me and drink! ","Have faith in me
 and you will have life-giving water flowing from deep inside you

 who would be given to everyone that had faith in him. The Spirit had not yet been given to anyone
 since Jesus had not yet been given his full glory.","Then they said
 \u201cTeacher
 this woman was caught sleeping with a man who isn\u2019t her husband. ","They kept on asking Jesus about the woman. Finally
 he stood up and said
 \u201cIf any of you have never sinned
 then go ahead and throw the first stone at her!\u201d ","Jesus stood up and asked her
 \u201cWhere is everyone? Isn\u2019t there anyone left to accuse you?\u201d","\u201cNo sir
\u201d the woman answered. Then Jesus told her
 \u201cI am not going to accuse you either. You may go now
 but don\u2019t sin anymore.\u201d","Once again Jesus spoke to the people. This time he said
 \u201cI am the light for the world! Follow me

 what I say is true! I know where I came from and where I am going. But you don\u2019t know where I am from or where I am going. ","You judge in the same way that everyone else does
 but I don\u2019t judge anyone. ","If I did judge
 I would judge fairly
 because I would not be doing it alone. The Father who sent me is here with me. ","Your Law requires two witnesses to prove that something is true.","I am one of my witnesses
 and the Father who sent me is the other one.","\u201cWhere is your Father?\u201d they asked. \u201cYou don\u2019t know me or my Father!\u201d Jesus answered. \u201cIf you knew me
 you would know my Father.\u201d","Jesus also told them
 \u201cI am going away
 and you will look for me. But you cannot go where I am going
 and you will die with your sins unforgiven.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cYou are from below
 but I am from above. You belong to this world
 but I don\u2019t. ","That is why I said you will die with your sins unforgiven. If you don\u2019t have faith in me for who I am
 you will die
 and your sins will not be forgiven.\u201d","\u201cWho are you?\u201d they asked Jesus. Jesus answered
 \u201cI am exactly who I told you at the beginning. ","There is a lot more I could say to condemn you. But the one who sent me is truthful
 and I tell the people of this world only what I have heard from him.\u201d","Jesus went on to say
 \u201cWhen you have lifted up the Son of Man
 you will know who I am. You will also know that I don\u2019t do anything on my own. I say only what my Father taught me. ","The one who sent me is with me. I always do what pleases him

 just as you are doing what your father has taught you.","The people said to Jesus
 \u201cAbraham is our father!\u201d Jesus replied
 \u201cIf you were Abraham\u2019s children
 you would do what Abraham did. ","Instead
 you want to kill me for telling you the truth that God gave me. Abraham never did anything like that. ","But you are doing exactly what your father does.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t accuse us of having someone else as our father!\u201d they said. \u201cWe just have one father

 they run off and leave the sheep. Then the wolf attacks and scatters the flock. ","Hired workers run away because they don\u2019t care about the sheep.","I am the good shepherd. I know my sheep
 and they know me. ","Just as the Father knows me
 I know the Father
 and I give up my life for my sheep. ","I have other sheep that are not in this sheep pen. I must bring them together too
 when they hear my voice. Then there will be one flock of sheep and one shepherd.","The Father loves me
 because I give up my life
 so that I may receive it back again. ","No one takes my life from me. I give it up willingly! I have the power to give it up and the power to receive it back again
 just as my Father commanded me to do.","Jesus answered: I have told you
 and you refused to believe me. The things I do by my Father\u2019s authority show who I am. ","But since you are not my sheep
 you don\u2019t believe me. ","My sheep know my voice
 and I know them. They follow me
 ","and I give them eternal life
 so that they will never be lost. No one can snatch them out of my hand. ","My Father gave them to me
 and he is greater than all others. No one can snatch them from his hands

 \u201cI have shown you many good things that my Father sent me to do. Which one are you going to stone me for?\u201d","Jesus replied: In your Scriptures doesn\u2019t God say
 \u201cYou are gods\u201d? ","You can\u2019t argue with the Scriptures
 and God spoke to those people and called them gods. ","So why do you accuse me of a terrible sin for saying that I am the Son of God? After all
 it is the Father who prepared me for this work. He is also the one who sent me into the world. ","If I don\u2019t do as my Father does
 you should not believe me. ","But if I do what my Father does
 you should believe because of that
 even if you don\u2019t have faith in me. Then you will know for certain that the Father is one with me
 and I am one with the Father.","When Jesus heard this
 he said
 \u201cHis sickness won\u2019t end in death. It will bring glory to God and his Son.\u201d","Then he said to his disciples
 \u201cNow we will go back to Judea.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cAren\u2019t there twelve hours in each day? If you walk during the day
 you will have light from the sun
 and you won\u2019t stumble. ","But if you walk during the night
 you will stumble
 because you don\u2019t have any light.\u201d ","Then he told them
 \u201cOur friend Lazarus is asleep
 and I am going there to wake him up.\u201d","Then Jesus told them plainly
 \u201cLazarus is dead! ","I am glad that I wasn\u2019t there
 because now you will have a chance to put your faith in me. Let\u2019s go to him.\u201d","Thomas
 whose nickname was \u201cTwin
\u201d said to the other disciples
 \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s go
 so we can die with him.\u201d","Jesus told her
 \u201cYour brother will live again!\u201d","Jesus then said
 \u201cI am the one who raises the dead to life! Everyone who has faith in me will live
 even if they die. ","And everyone who lives because of faith in me will never really die. Do you believe this?\u201d","\u201cYes
 Lord!\u201d she replied. \u201cI believe that you are Christ
 the Son of God. You are the one we hoped would come into the world.\u201d","Mary went to where Jesus was. Then as soon as she saw him
 she knelt at his feet and said
 \u201cLord
 if you had been here
 my brother would not have died.\u201d","and asked
 \u201cWhere have you put his body?\u201d They replied
 \u201cLord
 come and you will see.\u201d","Then he told the people to roll the stone away. But Martha said
 \u201cLord
 you know that Lazarus has been dead four days
 and there will be a bad smell.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you that if you had faith
 you would see the glory of God?\u201d","After the stone had been rolled aside
 Jesus looked up toward heaven and prayed
 \u201cFather
 I thank you for answering my prayer. ","I know that you always answer my prayers. But I said this
 so that the people here would believe that you sent me.\u201d","When Jesus had finished praying
 he shouted
 \u201cLazarus
 come out!\u201d ","The man who had been dead came out. His hands and feet were wrapped with strips of burial cloth
 and a cloth covered his face. Jesus then told the people
 \u201cUntie him and let him go.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cLeave her alone! She has kept this perfume for the day of my burial. ","You will always have the poor with you
 but you won\u2019t always have me.\u201d","A crowd had come to meet Jesus because they had seen him call Lazarus out of the tomb. They kept talking about him and this miracle.","But the Pharisees said to each other
 \u201cThere is nothing that can be done! Everyone in the world is following Jesus.\u201d","Philip from Bethsaida in Galilee was there too. So they went to him and said
 \u201cSir
 we would like to meet Jesus.\u201d ","Jesus said: The time has come for the Son of Man to be given his glory.","I tell you for certain that a grain of wheat that falls on the ground will never be more than one grain unless it dies. But if it dies
 it will produce lots of wheat. ","If you love your life
 you will lose it. If you give it up in this world
 you will be given eternal life. ","If you serve me
 you must go with me. My servants will be with me wherever I am. If you serve me
 my Father will honor you.","Now I am deeply troubled
 and I don\u2019t know what to say. But I must not ask my Father to keep me from this time of suffering. In fact
 I came into the world to suffer. ","So Father
 bring glory to yourself. A voice from heaven then said
 \u201cI have already brought glory to myself
 and I will do it again!\u201d ","Then Jesus told the crowd
 \u201cThat voice spoke to help you
 not me. ","This world\u2019s people are now being judged
 and the ruler of this world is already being thrown out! ","If I am lifted up above the earth
 I will make everyone want to come to me.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cThe light will be with you for only a little longer. Walk in the light while you can. Then you won\u2019t be caught walking blindly in the dark. ","Have faith in the light while it is with you
 and you will be children of the light.\u201d After Jesus had said these things
 he left and went into hiding. ","In a loud voice Jesus said: Everyone who has faith in me also has faith in the one who sent me.","And everyone who has seen me has seen the one who sent me.","I am the light that has come into the world. No one who has faith in me will stay in the dark.","I am not the one who will judge those who refuse to obey my teachings. I came to save the people of this world
 not to be their judge. ","But everyone who rejects me and my teachings will be judged on the last day by what I have said.","I don\u2019t speak on my own. I say only what the Father who sent me has told me to say.","I know that his commands will bring eternal life. That is why I tell you exactly what the Father has told me.","Jesus answered
 \u201cYou don\u2019t really know what I am doing

\u201d Jesus told him
 \u201cyou don\u2019t really belong to me.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cPeople who have bathed and are clean all over need to wash just their feet. And you

 are clean

 \u201cexcept for one of you.\u201d","After Jesus had washed his disciples' feet and had put his outer garment back on
 he sat down again. Then he said: Do you understand what I have done? ","You call me your teacher and Lord

 you should do the same for each other. ","I have set the example
 and you should do for each other exactly what I have done for you. ","I tell you for certain that servants are not greater than their master
 and messengers are not greater than the one who sent them. ","You know these things
 and God will bless you
 if you do them.","I am not talking about all of you. I know the ones I have chosen. But what the Scriptures say must come true. And they say
 \u201cThe man who ate with me has turned against me!\u201d ","I am telling you this before it all happens. Then when it does happen
 you will believe who I am. ","I tell you for certain that anyone who welcomes my messengers also welcomes me
 and anyone who welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me.","After Jesus had said these things
 he was deeply troubled and told his disciples
 \u201cI tell you for certain that one of you will betray me.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cI will dip this piece of bread in the sauce and give it to the one I was talking about.\u201d Then Jesus dipped the bread and gave it to Judas
 the son of Simon Iscariot. ","Right then Satan took control of Judas. Jesus said
 \u201cJudas
 go quickly and do what you have to do.\u201d ","After Judas had gone
 Jesus said: Now the Son of Man will be given glory

 after God is given glory because of him
 God will bring glory to him
 and God will do it very soon.","My children
 I will be with you for a little while longer. Then you will look for me

 just as I have loved you. ","If you love each other

 you will say three times that you don\u2019t even know me.\u201d","Jesus said to his disciples
 \u201cDon\u2019t be worried! Have faith in God and have faith in me. ","There are many rooms in my Father\u2019s house. I wouldn\u2019t tell you this
 unless it was true. I am going there to prepare a place for each of you. ","After I have done this
 I will come back and take you with me. Then we will be together. ","You know the way to where I am going.\u201d","\u201cI am the way

 no one can go to the Father. ","If you had known me
 you would have known the Father. But from now on
 you do know him
 and you have seen him.\u201d","Jesus replied: Philip

 you have seen the Father. How can you ask me to show you the Father? ","Don\u2019t you believe that I am one with the Father and that the Father is one with me? What I say isn\u2019t said on my own. The Father who lives in me does these things.","Have faith in me when I say that the Father is one with me and that I am one with the Father. Or else have faith in me simply because of the things I do.","I tell you for certain that if you have faith in me
 you will do the same things that I am doing. You will do even greater things
 now that I am going back to the Father. ","Ask me
 and I will do whatever you ask. This way the Son will bring honor to the Father. ","I will do whatever you ask me to do.","Jesus said to his disciples: If you love me
 you will do as I command. ","Then I will ask the Father to send you the Holy Spirit who will help you and always be with you.","The Spirit will show you what is true. The people of this world cannot accept the Spirit
 because they don\u2019t see or know him. But you know the Spirit
 who is with you and will keep on living in you.","I won\u2019t leave you like orphans. I will come back to you.","In a little while the people of this world won\u2019t be able to see me
 but you will see me. And because I live
 you will live. ","Then you will know that I am one with the Father. You will know that you are one with me
 and I am one with you. ","If you love me
 you will do what I have said
 and my Father will love you. I will also love you and show you what I am like.","The other Judas
 not Judas Iscariot
 then spoke up and asked
 \u201cLord
 what do you mean by saying that you will show us what you are like
 but you will not show the people of this world?\u201d","Jesus replied: If anyone loves me
 they will obey me. Then my Father will love them

 won\u2019t obey me. What they have heard me say doesn\u2019t really come from me

 because the Father will send the Spirit to take my place. The Spirit will teach you everything and will remind you of what I said while I was with you.","I give you peace
 the kind of peace that only I can give. It isn\u2019t like the peace that this world can give. So don\u2019t be worried or afraid.","You have already heard me say that I am going and that I will also come back to you. If you really love me
 you should be glad that I am going back to the Father
 because he is greater than I am.","I am telling you this before I leave
 so that when it does happen
 you will have faith in me. ","I cannot speak with you much longer
 because the ruler of this world is coming. But he has no power over me. ","I obey my Father
 so that everyone in the world might know that I love him. It is time for us to go now.","Jesus said to his disciples: I am the true vine
 and my Father is the gardener. ","He cuts away every branch of mine that doesn\u2019t produce fruit. But he trims clean every branch that does produce fruit
 so that it will produce even more fruit. ","You are already clean because of what I have said to you.","Stay joined to me

 you cannot produce fruit unless you stay joined to me. ","I am the vine
 and you are the branches. If you stay joined to me
 and I stay joined to you
 then you will produce lots of fruit. But you cannot do anything without me. ","If you don\u2019t stay joined to me
 you will be thrown away. You will be like dry branches that are gathered up and burned in a fire.","Stay joined to me and let my teachings become part of you. Then you can pray for whatever you want

 my Father will be honored. ","I have loved you
 just as my Father has loved me. So remain faithful to my love for you. ","If you obey me
 I will keep loving you
 just as my Father keeps loving me
 because I have obeyed him.","I have told you this to make you as completely happy as I am.","Now I tell you to love each other
 as I have loved you. ","The greatest way to show love for friends is to die for them.","And you are my friends
 if you obey me. ","Servants don\u2019t know what their master is doing
 and so I don\u2019t speak to you as my servants. I speak to you as my friends
 and I have told you everything that my Father has told me.","You did not choose me. I chose you and sent you out to produce fruit
 the kind of fruit that will last. Then my Father will give you whatever you ask for in my name. ","So I command you to love each other.","If the people of this world hate you
 just remember that they hated me first. ","If you belonged to the world
 its people would love you. But you don\u2019t belong to the world. I have chosen you to leave the world behind
 and that is why its people hate you. ","Remember how I told you that servants are not greater than their master. So if people mistreat me
 they will mistreat you. If they do what I say
 they will do what you say.","People will do to you exactly what they did to me. They will do it because you belong to me
 and they don\u2019t know the one who sent me. ","If I had not come and spoken to them
 they would not be guilty of sin. But now they have no excuse for their sin.","Everyone who hates me also hates my Father.","I have done things that no one else has ever done. If they had not seen me do these things
 they would not be guilty. But they did see me do these things
 and they still hate me and my Father too. ","That is why the Scriptures are true when they say
 \u201cPeople hated me for no reason.\u201d","I will send you the Spirit who comes from the Father and shows what is true. The Spirit will help you and will tell you about me.","Then you will also tell others about me
 because you have been with me from the beginning.","I am telling you this to keep you from being afraid.","You will be chased out of the Jewish meeting places. And the time will come when people will kill you and think they are doing God a favor.","They will do these things because they don\u2019t know either the Father or me.","I am saying this to you now
 so that when the time comes
 you will remember what I have said. I was with you at the first
 and so I didn\u2019t tell you these things. ","But now I am going back to the Father who sent me
 and none of you asks me where I am going. ","You are very sad from hearing all of this.","But I tell you that I am going to do what is best for you. That is why I am going away. The Holy Spirit cannot come to help  you until I leave. But after I am gone
 I will send the Spirit to you.","The Spirit will come and show the people of this world the truth about sin and God\u2019s justice and the judgment.","The Spirit will show them that they are wrong about sin
 because they didn\u2019t have faith in me. ","They are wrong about God\u2019s justice
 because I am going to the Father
 and you won\u2019t see me again. ","And they are wrong about the judgment
 because God has already judged the ruler of this world.","I have much more to say to you
 but right now it would be more than you could understand. ","The Spirit shows what is true and will come and guide you into the full truth. The Spirit doesn\u2019t speak on his own. He will tell you only what he has heard from me
 and he will let you know what is going to happen. ","The Spirit will bring glory to me by taking my message and telling it to you.","Everything that the Father has is mine. That is why I have said that the Spirit takes my message and tells it to you.","Jesus told his disciples
 \u201cFor a little while you won\u2019t see me
 but after a while you will see me. \u201c","They said to each other
 \u201cWhat does Jesus mean by saying that for a little while we won\u2019t see him
 but after a while we will see him? What does he mean by saying that he is going to the Father? ","What is this \u2018little while\u2019 that he is talking about? We don\u2019t know what he means.\u201d","Jesus knew that they had some questions
 so he said: You are wondering what I meant when I said that for a little while you won\u2019t see me
 but after a while you will see me. ","I tell you for certain that you will cry and be sad
 but the world will be happy. You will be sad
 but later you will be happy.","When a woman is about to give birth
 she is in great pain. But after it is all over
 she forgets the pain and is happy
 because she has brought a child into the world. ","You are now very sad. But later I will see you
 and you will be so happy that no one will be able to change the way you feel. ","When that time comes
 you won\u2019t have to ask me about anything. I tell you for certain that the Father will give you whatever you ask for in my name. ","You have not asked for anything in this way before
 but now you must ask in my name. Then it will be given to you
 so that you will be completely happy.","I have used examples to explain to you what I have been talking about. But the time will come when I will speak to you plainly about the Father and will no longer use examples like these.","You will ask the Father in my name
 and I won\u2019t have to ask him for you. ","God the Father loves you because you love me
 and you believe that I have come from him. ","I came from the Father into the world
 but I am leaving the world and returning to the Father.","Jesus replied: Do you really believe me?","The time will come and is already here when all of you will be scattered. Each of you will go back home and leave me by myself. But the Father will be with me
 and I won\u2019t be alone. ","I have told you this
 so that you might have peace in your hearts because of me. While you are in the world
 you will have to suffer. But cheer up! I have defeated the world.","After Jesus had finished speaking to his disciples
 he looked up toward heaven and prayed: Father
 the time has come for you to bring glory to your Son
 in order that he may bring glory to you. ","And you gave him power over all people
 so that he would give eternal life to everyone you give him. ","Eternal life is to know you
 the only true God
 and to know Jesus Christ
 the one you sent. ","I have brought glory to you here on earth by doing everything you gave me to do.","Now
 Father
 give me back the glory that I had with you before the world was created.","You have given me some followers from this world
 and I have shown them what you are like. They were yours
 but you gave them to me
 and they have obeyed you. ","They know that you gave me everything I have.","I told my followers what you told me
 and they accepted it. They know that I came from you
 and they believe that you are the one who sent me. ","I am praying for them
 but not for those who belong to this world. My followers belong to you
 and I am praying for them. ","All that I have is yours
 and all that you have is mine

 I am no longer in the world. I am coming to you
 but my followers are still in the world. So keep them safe by the power of the name that you have given me. Then they will be one with each other
 just as you and I are one. ","While I was with them
 I kept them safe by the power you have given me. I guarded them
 and not one of them was lost

 so that my followers will have the same complete joy that I do. ","I have told them your message. But the people of this world hate them
 because they don\u2019t belong to this world
 just as I don\u2019t.","Father
 I don\u2019t ask you to take my followers out of the world

 and neither do I. ","Your word is the truth. So let this truth make them completely yours.","I am sending them into the world
 just as you sent me. ","I have given myself completely for their sake
 so that they may belong completely to the truth.","I am not praying just for these followers. I am also praying for everyone else who will have faith because of what my followers will say about me.","I want all of them to be one with each other
 just as I am one with you and you are one with me. I also want them to be one with us. Then the people of this world will believe that you sent me.","I have honored my followers in the same way that you honored me
 in order that they may be one with each other
 just as we are one. ","I am one with them
 and you are one with me
 so that they may become completely one. Then this world\u2019s people will know that you sent me. They will know that you love my followers as much as you love me.","Father
 I want everyone you have given me to be with me
 wherever I am. Then they will see the glory that you have given me

 the people of this world don\u2019t know you. But I know you

 \u201cWho are you looking for?\u201d \u201cWe are looking for Jesus from Nazareth

 \u201cThe fever left him yesterday at one o\u2019clock in the afternoon.\u201d","Then the father realized that this was the very hour when Jesus had told him
 \u201cYour son will live.\u201d So he himself believed
 along with his whole family.","When Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had already been there a long time
 he asked him
 \u201cDo you want to get well?\u201d","Jesus told him
 \u201cStand up
 pick up your mat
 and walk!\u201d ","But he answered them
 \u201cThe man who made me well told me
 \u2018Pick up your mat and walk.\u2019\u201d","Later on
 Jesus found him in the Temple and told him
 \u201cLook! You have become well. Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you.\u201d ","But Jesus answered them
 \u201cMy Father has been working until now
 and I
 too
 am working.\u201d ","Jesus told them
 \u201cTruly
 I tell all of you emphatically
 the Son can do nothing on his own accord
 but only what he sees the Father doing
 What the Father does
 the Son does likewise. ","The Father loves the Son and shows him everything he is doing
 and he will show him even greater actions than these
 so that you may be amazed. ","Just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life
 so also the Son gives life to those he chooses. ","The Father judges no one
 but has given all authority to judge to the Son
 ","so that everyone may honor the Son as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.","\u201cTruly
 I tell all of you emphatically
 whoever hears what I say and believes in the one who sent me has eternal life and will not be judged
 but has passed from death to life. ","Truly
 I tell all of you emphatically
 the time approaches
 and is now here
 when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God
 and those who hear it will live. ","Just as the Father has life in himself
 so also he has granted the Son to have life in himself
 ","and he has given him authority to judge
 because he is the Son of Man. ","Don\u2019t be amazed at this
 because the time is approaching when everyone in their graves will hear the Son of Man\u2019s voice ","and will come out\u2014those who have done what is good to the resurrection that leads to life
 and those who have practiced what is evil to the resurrection that ends in condemnation. ","I can do nothing on my own accord. I judge according to what I hear
 and my judgment is just
 because I do not seek my own will but the will of the one who sent me.\u201d","\u201cIf I testify on my own behalf
 my testimony is not trustworthy. ","There is another who testifies about me
 and I know that the testimony he gives about me is true. ","You have sent messengers to John
 and he has testified to the truth. ","I myself do not accept human testimony
 but I am saying these things so that you may be saved. ","That man John was a lamp that burns and brightly shines
 and for a while you were willing to rejoice in his light.","\u201cBut I have a greater testimony than John\u2019s
 because the actions that the Father has given me to complete\u2014the very actions that I am doing\u2014testify on my behalf that the Father has sent me. ","Moreover
 the Father who sent me has himself testified on my behalf. You have never heard his voice or seen what he looks like
 ","nor do you have his word at work in you
 because you do not believe in the one whom he sent. ","You examine the Scriptures carefully because you suppose that in them you have eternal life. Yet they testify about me.","But you are not willing to come to me to have life.","\u201cI do not accept human praise.","I know that you do not have the love of God in you.","I have come in my Father\u2019s name
 and you do not accept me. Yet if another man comes in his own name
 you will accept him. ","How can you believe when you accept each other\u2019s praise and do not look for the praise that comes from the only God?","Do not suppose that I will be the one to accuse you before the Father. Your accuser is Moses
 on whom you have set your hope
 ","because if you believed Moses
 you would believe me
 since he wrote about me. ","But if you do not believe what he wrote
 how will you believe my words?\u201d","When Jesus looked up and saw that a large crowd was coming toward him
 he asked Philip
 \u201cWhere can we buy bread for these people to eat?\u201d ","Jesus said
 \u201cHave the people sit down.\u201d Now there was plenty of grass in that area
 so they sat down
 numbering about 5
000 men.","When they were completely satisfied
 Jesus told his disciples
 \u201cCollect the pieces that are left over so that nothing is wasted.\u201d ","But he told them
 \u201cIt is I. Stop being afraid!\u201d ","Jesus replied to them
 \u201cTruly
 I tell all of you emphatically
 you are looking for me
 not because you saw signs
 but because you ate the loaves and were completely satisfied. ","Do not work for food that perishes but for food that lasts for eternal life
 which the Son of Man will give you
 because God the Father has set his seal on him.\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cThis is God\u2019s work: to believe in the one whom he has sent.\u201d","Jesus told them
 \u201cTruly
 I tell all of you emphatically
 it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven
 but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven. ","The bread of God is the one who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.\u201d","Jesus told them
 \u201cI am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never become hungry
 and whoever believes in me will never become thirsty. ","I told you that you have seen me
 yet you don\u2019t believe. ","Everything the Father gives me will come to me
 and I\u2019ll never turn away the one who comes to me. ","I have come down from heaven
 not to do my own will
 but the will of the one who sent me. ","And this is the will of the one who sent me
 that I should not lose anything that he has given me
 but should raise it to life on the last day. ","This is my Father\u2019s will: That everyone who sees the Son and believes in him should have eternal life
 and I will raise him to life on the last day.\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cStop grumbling among yourselves. ","No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him
 and I will raise him to life on the last day. ","It is written in the Prophets
 \u2018And all of them will be taught by God.\u2019 Everyone who has listened to the Father and has learned anything comes to me. ","Not that anyone has seen the Father except the one who comes from God. This one has seen the Father.","Truly
 I tell all of you emphatically
 the one who believes in me has eternal life. ","I\u2019m the bread of life.","Your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness and died.","This is the bread that comes down from heaven
 so that a person may eat it and not die. ","I\u2019m the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats this bread
 he\u2019ll live forever. And the bread I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.\u201d","So Jesus told them
 \u201cTruly
 I tell all of you emphatically
 unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood
 you don\u2019t have life in yourselves. ","Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life
 and I\u2019ll raise him to life on the last day
 ","because my flesh is real food
 and my blood is real drink. ","The person who eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me
 and I in him. ","Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father
 so the one who feeds on me will also live because of me. ","This is the bread that came down from heaven
 not the kind that your ancestors ate. They died
 but the one who eats this bread will live forever.\u201d ","But Jesus
 knowing within himself that his disciples were grumbling about this
 asked them
 \u201cDoes this offend you? ","What if you saw the Son of Man going up to the place where he was before?","It\u2019s the Spirit who gives life; the flesh accomplishes nothing. The words that I\u2019ve spoken to you are spirit and life.","But there are some among you who don\u2019t believe...\u201d\u2014because Jesus knew from the beginning those who weren\u2019t believing
 as well as the one who would betray him. ","So he said
 \u201cThat\u2019s why I told you that no one can come to me unless it be granted him by the Father.\u201d ","So Jesus asked the Twelve
 \u201cYou don\u2019t want to leave
 too
 do you?\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cI chose you
 the Twelve
 didn\u2019t I? Yet one of you is a devil.\u201d ","So his brothers told him
 \u201cYou should leave this place and go to Judea
 so that your disciples can see the actions that you\u2019re doing
 ","Jesus told them
 \u201cMy time has not yet come
 but your time is always here. ","The world cannot hate you
 but it hates me because I testify against it that its actions are evil. ","Go up to the festival yourselves. I am not going to this festival yet
 because my time hasn\u2019t fully come.\u201d ","Jesus replied to them
 \u201cMy teaching is not mine but comes from the one who sent me. ","If anyone wants to do his will
 he\u2019ll know whether this teaching is from God or whether I\u2019m speaking on my own. ","The one who speaks on his own seeks his own praise. But the one who seeks the praise of him who sent him is genuine
 and there\u2019s nothing false in him. ","Moses gave you the Law
 didn\u2019t he? Yet none of you is keeping the Law. Why are you trying to kill me?\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cI performed one action
 and all of you are astonished. ","Moses gave you circumcision\u2014not that it is from Moses
 but from the Patriarchs\u2014and so you circumcise a man on the Sabbath. ","If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath so that the Law of Moses may not be broken
 are you angry with me because I made a man perfectly well on the Sabbath? ","Stop judging by appearances
 but judge with righteous judgment!\u201d","Then some of the people of Jerusalem began saying
 \u201cThis is the man they are trying to kill
 isn\u2019t it? ","At this point Jesus
 still teaching in the Temple
 shouted
 \u201cSo you know me and know where I\u2019ve come from? I haven\u2019t come on my own accord. But the one who sent me is true
 and he\u2019s the one you don\u2019t know. ","I know him because I\u2019ve come from him
 and he sent me.\u201d","Then Jesus said
 \u201cI\u2019ll be with you only a little while longer
 and then I\u2019m going back to the one who sent me. ","You\u2019ll look for me but won\u2019t find me. And where I am
 you cannot come.\u201d","Then the Jewish leaders asked one another
 \u201cWhere does this man intend to go that we won\u2019t be able to find him? Surely he\u2019s not going to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks
 is he? ","On the last and most important day of the festival
 Jesus stood up and shouted
 \u201cIf anyone is thirsty
 let him come to me and drink! ","The one who believes in me
 as the Scripture has said
 will have rivers of living water flowing from his heart.\u201d ","Now he said this about the Spirit
 whom those who were believing in him were to receive
 because the Spirit was not yet present and Jesus had not yet been glorified.","they told him
 \u201cTeacher
 this woman has been caught in the very act of adultery. ","When they persisted in questioning him
 he straightened up and told them
 \u201cLet the person among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.\u201d ","Then Jesus stood up and asked her
 \u201cDear lady
 where are your accusers? Hasn\u2019t anyone condemned you?\u201d","\u201cNo one
 sir
\u201d she replied. Then Jesus said
 \u201cI don\u2019t condemn you
 either. Go home
 and from now on don\u2019t sin anymore.\u201d","Later on
 Jesus spoke to them again
 saying
 \u201cI am the light of the world. The one who follows me will never walk in darkness
 but will have the light of life.\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cEven though I\u2019m testifying about myself
 my testimony is valid because I know where I\u2019ve come from and where I\u2019m going. But you don\u2019t know where I come from or where I\u2019m going. ","You\u2019re judging by human standards
 but I\u2019m not judging anyone. ","Yet even if I should judge
 my judgment would be valid
 because it is not I alone who judges
 but I and the one who sent me. ","In your own Law it is written that the testimony of two people is valid.","I\u2019m testifying about myself
 and the Father who sent me is testifying about me.\u201d","Then they asked him
 \u201cWhere is this Father of yours?\u201d Jesus replied
 \u201cYou don\u2019t know me or my Father. If you had known me
 you would\u2019ve known my Father
 too.\u201d ","Later on
 he told them again
 \u201cI\u2019m going away
 and you\u2019ll look for me
 but you will die in your sin. You cannot come where I\u2019m going.\u201d","He told them
 \u201cYou are from below
 I\u2019m from above. You are of this world
 but I\u2019m not of this world. ","That is why I told you that you will die in your sins
 for unless you believe that I AM
 you\u2019ll die in your sins.\u201d","Then they asked him
 \u201cWho are you?\u201d Jesus told them
 \u201cWhat have I been telling you all along? ","I have much to say about you and to condemn you for. But the one who sent me is truthful
 and what I\u2019ve heard from him I declare to the world.\u201d","So Jesus told them
 \u201cWhen you have lifted up the Son of Man
 then you will know that I AM
 and that I do nothing on my own authority. Instead
 I speak only what the Father has taught me. ","Moreover
 the one who sent me is with me. He has never left me alone
 because I always do what pleases him.\u201d ","So Jesus told those Jews who had believed in him
 \u201cIf you continue in my word
 you are really my disciples. ","And you will know the truth
 and the truth will set you free.\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cTruly
 I tell all of you emphatically
 that everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin. ","The slave does not remain in the household forever
 but the son does remain forever. ","So if the Son sets you free
 you will be free indeed!\u201d","\u201cI know that you are Abraham\u2019s descendants. Yet you are trying to kill me because you\u2019ve not received what I\u2019ve told you.","I declare what I\u2019ve seen in my Father\u2019s presence
 and you\u2019re doing what you\u2019ve heard from your father.\u201d","They replied to him
 \u201cOur father is Abraham!\u201d Jesus told them
 \u201cIf you were Abraham\u2019s children
 you would be doing what Abraham did. ","But now you\u2019re trying to kill me
 a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham wouldn\u2019t have done that. ","You are doing your father\u2019s actions.\u201d They told him
 \u201cWe\u2019re not illegitimate children. We have one Father
 God himself.\u201d","Jesus told them
 \u201cIf God were your Father
 you would\u2019ve loved me
 because I came from God and am here. I haven\u2019t come on my own accord
 but he sent me. ","Why don\u2019t you understand what I\u2019ve said? It\u2019s because you can\u2019t listen to my words.","You belong to your father the Devil
 and you want to carry out the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning and has never stood for truth
 since there is no truth in him. Whenever he tells a lie
 he speaks in character
 because he is a liar and the father of lies. ","But it is because I speak the truth that you don\u2019t believe me.","Can any of you prove me guilty of sin? If I\u2019m telling the truth
 why don\u2019t you believe me? ","The one who belongs to God listens to the words of God. The reason you don\u2019t listen is because you don\u2019t belong to God.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cI don\u2019t have a demon. On the contrary
 I honor my Father
 and you dishonor me. ","I don\u2019t seek my own glory. There is one who seeks it
 and he is the Judge. ","Truly
 I tell all of you emphatically
 if anyone keeps my word
 he will never see death.\u201d","Then the Jewish leaders told him
 \u201cNow we really know that you have a demon. Abraham died
 and so did the prophets
 but you say
 \u2018If anyone keeps my word
 he will never taste death.\u2019 ","Jesus answered
 \u201cIf I were trying to glorify myself
 my glory would mean nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me
 of whom you say
 \u2018He is our God.\u2019 ","You don\u2019t know him
 but I know him. If I were to say that I don\u2019t know him
 I would be a liar like you. But I do know him and keep his word. ","Your father Abraham rejoiced that he would see my day
 and he saw it and was glad.\u201d","Jesus told them
 \u201cTruly
 I tell all of you emphatically
 before there was an Abraham
 I AM!\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cNeither this man nor his parents sinned. This happened so that God\u2019s work might be revealed in him. ","I must do the work of the one who sent me while it is day. Night is approaching
 when no one can work. ","As long as I\u2019m in the world
 I\u2019m the light of the world.\u201d ","and told him
 \u201cGo and wash in the pool of Siloam\u201d (which is translated \u201cSent One\u201d). So he went off
 washed
 and came back seeing.","He said
 \u201cThe man named Jesus made some mud
 spread it on my eyes
 and told me
 \u2018Go to Siloam and wash.\u2019 So off I went and washed
 and I received my sight.\u201d","They asked him
 \u201cWhere is that man?\u201d He said
 \u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d","The Jewish leaders summoned the man who had been blind a second time and told him
 \u201cGive glory to God! We know that this man is a sinner.\u201d","But he responded
 \u201cI don\u2019t know whether he is a sinner or not. The one thing I do know is that I used to be blind and now I can see!\u201d","Then they asked him
 \u201cWhat did he do to you? How did he heal your eyes?\u201d","He answered them
 \u201cI\u2019ve already told you
 but you didn\u2019t listen. Why do you want to hear it again? You don\u2019t want to become his disciples
 too
 do you?\u201d","Jesus heard that they had thrown him out. So when he found him
 he asked him
 \u201cDo you believe in the Son of Man?\u201d","Jesus told him
 \u201cYou have seen him. He is the person who is talking with you.\u201d","Then Jesus said
 \u201cI have come into this world to judge it
 so that those who are blind may see and so that those who see may become blind.\u201d","Jesus told them
 \u201cIf you were blind
 you would not have any sin. But now that you insist
 \u2018We see
\u2019 your sin still exists.\u201d","\u201cTruly
 I tell all of you emphatically
 the person who doesn\u2019t enter the sheepfold through the gate
 but climbs in by some other way
 is a thief and a bandit. ","The one who enters through the gate is the shepherd of the sheep.","It\u2019s to him the gatekeeper opens the gate
 and it\u2019s his voice the sheep hear. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. ","When he has driven out all his own
 he goes ahead of them
 and the sheep follow him because they recognize his voice. ","They\u2019ll never follow a stranger
 but will run away from him because they don\u2019t recognize the voice of strangers.\u201d ","So again Jesus said
 \u201cTruly
 I tell all of you emphatically
 I\u2019m the gate for the sheep. ","All who came before me are thieves and bandits
 but the sheep didn\u2019t listen to them. ","I\u2019m the gate. If anyone enters through me
 he will be saved. He\u2019ll come in and go out and find pasture. ","The thief comes only to steal
 slaughter
 and destroy. I\u2019ve come that they may have life
 and have it abundantly.","\u201cI\u2019m the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.","The hired worker
 who isn\u2019t the shepherd and doesn\u2019t own the sheep
 sees the wolf coming
 deserts the sheep
 and runs away. So the wolf snatches them and scatters them
 ","because he\u2019s a hired worker
 and the sheep don\u2019t matter to him.","I\u2019m the good shepherd. I know my own and my own know me
 ","just as the Father knows me and I know the Father. And I lay down my life for the sheep.","I have other sheep that don\u2019t belong to this fold. I must lead these also
 and they\u2019ll listen to my voice. So there will be one flock and one shepherd. ","This is why the Father loves me
 because I lay down my life in order to take it back again. ","No one is taking it from me; I lay it down of my own free will. I have the authority to lay it down
 and I have the authority to take it back again. This is what my Father has commanded me.\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cI have told you
 but you don\u2019t believe it. The actions that I do in my Father\u2019s name testify on my behalf
 ","but you don\u2019t believe
 because you don\u2019t belong to my sheep. ","My sheep hear my voice. I know them
 and they follow me. ","I give them eternal life
 they\u2019ll never be lost
 and no one will snatch them out of my hand. ","What my Father has given me is more important than anything
 and no one can snatch it from the Father\u2019s hand. ","I and the Father are one.\u201d","Jesus replied to them
 \u201cI\u2019ve shown you many good actions from my Father. For which of them are you going to stone me?\u201d","Jesus replied to them
 \u201cIs it not written in your Law
 \u2018I said
 \u201cYou are gods\u201d\u2019? ","If he called those to whom a message from God came \u2018gods\u2019 (and the Scripture cannot be disregarded)
 ","how can you say to the one whom the Father has consecrated and sent into the world
 \u2018You\u2019re blaspheming
\u2019 because I said
 \u2018I\u2019m the Son of God\u2019? ","If I\u2019m not doing my Father\u2019s actions
 don\u2019t believe me. ","But if I\u2019m doing them

 believe the actions
 so that you may know and understand that the Father is in me and I am in the Father.\u201d","But when Jesus heard it
 he said
 \u201cThis illness isn\u2019t meant to end in death. It\u2019s for God\u2019s glory
 so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.\u201d ","After this
 he told the disciples
 \u201cLet\u2019s go back to Judea.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cThere are twelve hours in the day

 because he sees the light of this world. ","But if anyone walks at night he stumbles
 because the light is not in him.\u201d ","These were the things he said. Then after this
 he told them
 \u201cOur friend Lazarus has fallen asleep

 \u201cLazarus has died. ","For your sake I\u2019m glad that I wasn\u2019t there
 so that you may believe. But let\u2019s go to him.\u201d","Then Thomas
 who was called the Twin
 told his fellow disciples
 \u201cLet\u2019s go
 too

 \u201cYour brother will rise again.\u201d","Jesus told her
 \u201cI am the resurrection and the life. The person who believes in me

 will live. ","Indeed
 everyone who lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe that?\u201d","\u201cYes

\u201d she told him. \u201cI believe that you are the Messiah
 the Son of God
 the one who was to come into the world.\u201d","As soon as Mary came to where Jesus was and saw him
 she fell down at his feet and told him
 \u201cLord

 my brother wouldn\u2019t have died.\u201d","He asked
 \u201cWhere have you put him?\u201d They told him
 \u201cLord

 \u201cRemove the stone.\u201d Martha
 the dead man\u2019s sister
 told him
 \u201cLord
 there must be a stench by now

 \u201cI told you that if you believed you would see God\u2019s glory

 \u201cFather
 I thank you for hearing me. ","I know that you always hear me

 he shouted with a loud voice
 \u201cLazarus

 his hands and feet tied with strips of cloth
 and his face wrapped in a handkerchief. Jesus told them
 \u201cUntie him

 \u201cLeave her alone so she can observe the day of my burial
 ","because you will always have the destitute with you

 save me from this hour\u2019? No! It was for this very reason that I came to this hour. ","Father
 glorify your name.\u201d Then a voice came from heaven
 \u201cI have glorified it
 and I will glorify it again!\u201d ","Jesus replied
 \u201cThis voice is for your benefit
 not for mine. ","Now is the time for the judgment of this world to begin. Now the ruler of this world will be thrown out.","As for me
 if I am lifted up from the earth
 I will draw all people to myself.\u201d ","Jesus replied to the crowd
 \u201cThe light is among you only for a short time. Walk while you have the light
 so that the darkness may not overtake you. The person who walks in the darkness is in the darkness and does not know where he is going. ","As long as you have the light
 believe in the light
 so that you may become children of light.\u201d After Jesus had said this
 he went away and hid from them.","Then Jesus said loudly
 \u201cThe one who believes in me does not believe in me only
 but also in the one who sent me. ","The one who sees me sees the one who sent me.","I\u2019ve come into the world as light
 so that everyone who believes in me won\u2019t remain in the darkness. ","If anyone hears my words and doesn\u2019t keep them
 I don\u2019t condemn him
 because I didn\u2019t come to condemn the world
 but to save it. ","The one who rejects me and doesn\u2019t receive my words has something to judge him: The word that I\u2019ve spoken will judge him on the last day
 ","because I haven\u2019t spoken on my own authority. Instead
 the Father who sent me has himself commanded me what to say and how to speak. ","And I know that what he commands brings eternal life. What I speak
 therefore
 I speak just as the Father has told me.\u201d","Jesus answered him
 \u201cYou don\u2019t realize now what I\u2019m doing
 but later on you\u2019ll understand.\u201d","Peter told him
 \u201cYou must never wash my feet!\u201d Jesus answered him
 \u201cUnless I wash you
 you cannot be involved with me.\u201d","Jesus told him
 \u201cWhoever has bathed is entirely clean. He doesn\u2019t need to wash himself further
 except for his feet. And you men are clean
 though not all of you.\u201d ","For he knew who was going to betray him. That\u2019s why he said
 \u201cNot all of you are clean.\u201d","When Jesus had washed their feet and put on his outer robe
 he sat down again and told them
 \u201cDo you realize what I\u2019ve done to you? ","You call me Teacher and Lord
 and you are right because that is what I am. ","So if I
 your Lord and Teacher
 have washed your feet
 you must also wash one another\u2019s feet. ","I\u2019ve set an example for you
 so that you may do as I have done to you. ","Truly
 I tell all of you emphatically
 a servant isn\u2019t greater than his master
 and a messenger isn\u2019t greater than the one who sent him. ","If you understand these things
 how blessed you are if you put them into practice! ","I\u2019m not talking about all of you. I know the ones I have chosen. But the Scripture must be fulfilled: \u2018The one who ate bread with me has turned against me.\u2019","I\u2019m telling you this now
 before it happens
 so that when it does happen
 you may believe that I AM. ","Truly
 I tell all of you emphatically
 the one who receives whomever I send receives me
 and the one who receives me receives the one who sent me.\u201d","After saying this
 Jesus was deeply troubled in spirit and declared solemnly
 \u201cTruly
 I tell all of you emphatically
 one of you is going to betray me!\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cHe is the one to whom I will give this piece of bread after I have dipped it in the dish.\u201d Then he took a piece of bread
 dipped it
 and gave it to Judas
 the son of Simon Iscariot. ","After he had taken the piece of bread
 Satan entered him. Then Jesus told him
 \u201cDo quickly what you are going to do!\u201d ","After Judas had gone out
 Jesus said
 \u201cThe Son of Man is now glorified
 and God has been glorified by him. ","If God has been glorified by him
 God himself also will glorify the Son of Man
 and he will do so quickly. ","Little children
 I\u2019m with you only a little longer. You will look for me
 but what I told the Jewish leaders I now tell you
 \u2018Where I\u2019m going
 you cannot come.\u2019 ","I\u2019m giving you a new commandment\u2026to love one another. Just as I have loved you
 you also should love one another. ","This is how everyone will know that you are my disciples
 if you have love for one another.\u201d","Simon Peter asked him
 \u201cLord
 where are you going?\u201d Jesus answered him
 \u201cI\u2019m going where you cannot follow me now
 though you will follow me later on.\u201d","Jesus answered him
 \u201cWould you lay down your life for me? I tell you emphatically
 a rooster will not crow until you have denied me three times.\u201d","\u201cDon\u2019t let your hearts be troubled. Believe in God
 believe also in me. ","There are many rooms in my Father\u2019s house. If there weren\u2019t
 I wouldn\u2019t have told you that I am going away to prepare a place for you
 would I? ","And since I\u2019m going away to prepare a place for you
 I\u2019ll come back again and welcome you into my presence
 so that you may be where I am. ","You know where I am going
 and you know the way.\u201d","Jesus told him
 \u201cI am the way
 the truth
 and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. ","If you have known me
 you will also know my Father. From now on you know him and have seen him.\u201d","\u201cHave I been with you all this time
 Philip
 and you still do not know me?\u201d Jesus asked him. \u201cThe person who has seen me has seen the Father. So how can you say
 \u2018Show us the Father\u2019? ","You believe
 don\u2019t you
 that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I say to you I don\u2019t speak on my own. It is the Father who dwells in me and who carries out his work. ","Believe me
 I am in the Father and the Father is in me. Otherwise
 believe me because of what I\u2019ve been doing. ","Truly
 I tell all of you emphatically
 the one who believes in me will also do what I\u2019m doing. He will do even greater things than these
 because I\u2019m going to the Father. ","I\u2019ll do whatever you ask in my name
 so that the Father may be glorified in the Son. ","If you ask me for anything in my name
 I will do it.\u201d","\u201cIf you love me
 keep my commandments. ","I will ask the Father to give you another Helper
 to be with you always. ","He is the Spirit of truth
 whom the world cannot receive
 because it neither sees him nor recognizes him. But you recognize him
 because he lives with you and will be in you. ","I\u2019m not going to forsake you like orphans. I will come back to you.","\u201cIn a little while the world will no longer see me
 but you will see me. Because I live
 you will live also. ","At that time
 you\u2019ll know that I am in my Father
 that you are in me
 and that I am in you. ","The person who has my commandments and keeps them is the one who loves me. The one who loves me will be loved by my Father
 and I
 too
 will love him and reveal myself to him.\u201d","Judas (not Iscariot) asked him
 \u201cLord
 how is it that you are going to reveal yourself to us and not to the world?\u201d","Jesus answered him
 \u201cIf anyone loves me
 he will keep my word. Then my Father will love him
 and we will go to him and make our home within him. ","The one who doesn\u2019t love me doesn\u2019t keep my words. The words that you\u2019re hearing me say are not mine
 but come from the Father who sent me.","\u201cI have told you this while I am still with you.","But the Helper
 the Holy Spirit
 whom the Father will send in my name
 will teach you all things and remind you of everything that I have told you. ","I\u2019m leaving you at peace. I\u2019m giving you my own peace. I\u2019m not giving it to you as the world gives. So don\u2019t let your hearts be troubled
 and don\u2019t be afraid. ","You have heard me tell you
 \u2018I\u2019m going away
 but I\u2019m coming back to you.\u2019 If you loved me
 you would rejoice that I\u2019m going to the Father
 because the Father is greater than I am. ","I\u2019ve told you this now
 before I leave
 so that when I do leave
 you will believe. ","I won\u2019t talk with you much longer
 because the ruler of this world is coming. He has no power over me. ","But I\u2019m doing what the Father has commanded me
 to let the world know that I love the Father. Get up! Let us leave this place.\u201d","\u201cI am the true vine
 and my Father is the vintner. ","He cuts off every branch that does not produce fruit in me
 and he cuts back every branch that does produce fruit
 so that it might produce more fruit. ","You are already clean because of what I\u2019ve spoken to you.","\u201cAbide in me
 and I will abide in you. Just as the branch cannot produce fruit by itself unless it abides in the vine
 neither can you unless you abide in me. ","I am the vine
 you are the branches. The one who abides in me while I abide in him produces much fruit
 because apart from me you can do nothing. ","Unless a person abides in me
 he is thrown away like a pruned branch and dries up. People gather such branches
 throw them into a fire
 and they are burned up.","\u201cIf you abide in me and my words abide in you
 you can ask for anything you want
 and you\u2019ll receive it. ","This is how my Father is glorified
 when you produce a lot of fruit and so prove to be my disciples. ","Just as the Father has loved me
 so I have loved you. So abide in my love. ","If you keep my commandments
 you\u2019ll abide in my love
 just as I have kept my Father\u2019s commandments and abide in his love. ","I\u2019ve told you this
 so that my joy may be in you
 and that your joy may be complete.","\u201cThis is my commandment: that you love one another as I have loved you.","No one shows greater love than when he lays down his life for his friends.","You are my friends
 if you do what I command you. ","I don\u2019t call you servants anymore
 because a servant doesn\u2019t know what his master is doing. But I\u2019ve called you friends
 because I\u2019ve made known to you everything that I\u2019ve heard from my Father.","\u201cYou have not chosen me
 but I have chosen you. I have appointed you to go and produce fruit that will last
 so that whatever you ask the Father in my name
 he will give it to you. ","I am giving you these commandments so that you may love one another.\u201d","\u201cIf the world hates you
 you should realize that it hated me before you. ","If you belonged to the world
 the world would love you as one of its own. But because you do not belong to the world and I have chosen you out of it
 the world hates you. ","Remember what I told you: \u2018A servant is not greater than his master.\u2019 If they persecuted me
 they will also persecute you. If they kept my word
 they will also keep yours. ","They will do all these things to you on account of my name
 because they do not know the one who sent me.","\u201cIf I had not come and spoken to them
 they would not have any sin. But now they have no excuse for their sin. ","The person who hates me also hates my Father.","If I hadn\u2019t done among them the actions that no one else did
 they wouldn\u2019t have any sin. But now they have seen and hated both me and my Father. ","But this happened so that what has been written in their Law might be fulfilled: \u2018They hated me for no reason.\u2019","\u201cWhen the Helper comes

 because you have been with me from the beginning.","\u201cI have told you this to keep you from falling away.","You\u2019ll be thrown out of the synagogues. Yes
 a time is coming when the one who kills you will think he\u2019s serving God. ","They\u2019ll do this because they haven\u2019t known the Father or me.","But I\u2019ve told you this
 so that when the time comes you\u2019ll remember that I told you about them. I didn\u2019t tell you this in the beginning

 \u2018Where are you going?\u2019 ","But because I have told you this
 sorrow has filled your hearts. ","However
 I\u2019m telling you the truth. It\u2019s for your advantage that I\u2019m going away

 the Helper won\u2019t come to you. But if I go
 I will send him to you. ","When he comes
 he will convict the world of sin
 righteousness
 and judgment\u2014 ","of sin

 he\u2019ll guide you into all truth. He won\u2019t speak on his own accord

 because he will take what is mine and declare it to you. ","All that the Father has is mine. That is why I said
 \u2018He will take what is mine and declare it to you.\u2019 ","In a little while you will no longer see me
 then in a little while you will see me again.\u201d","At this point
 some of his disciples asked each other
 \u201cWhat does he mean by telling us
 \u2018In a little while you will no longer see me
 then in a little while you will see me again
\u2019 and
 \u2018because I am going to the Father\u2019?\u201d ","They kept saying
 \u201cWhat is this \u2018in a little while\u2019 that he keeps talking about? We don\u2019t know what he means.\u201d","Jesus knew that they wanted to ask him a question
 so he asked them
 \u201cAre you discussing among yourselves what I meant when I said
 \u2018In a little while you will no longer see me

 I tell all of you emphatically
 you\u2019ll cry and mourn

 but your pain will turn into joy. ","When a woman is in labor she has pain
 because her time has come. Yet when she has given birth to her child
 she doesn\u2019t remember the agony anymore because of the joy of having brought a human being into the world. ","Now you are having pain. But I\u2019ll see you again
 and your hearts will rejoice
 and no one will take your joy away from you. ","On that day
 you won\u2019t ask me for anything. Truly
 I tell all of you emphatically
 whatever you ask the Father for in my name
 he will give it to you. ","So far you haven\u2019t asked for anything in my name. Keep asking and you will receive
 so that your joy may be complete.\u201d","\u201cI have said these things to you in figurative language. The time is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figurative language
 but will tell you plainly about the Father. ","At that time
 you will make your requests in my name
 so that I will have no need to ask the Father on your behalf
 ","because the Father himself loves you
 and because you have loved me and believed that I came from God. ","I left the Father and came into the world. Now I\u2019m leaving the world and going back to the Father.\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cDo you now believe? ","Listen
 the time is coming
 indeed it has already come
 when you will be scattered
 each of you to his own home
 and you will leave me all by myself. Yet I\u2019m not alone
 because the Father is with me. ","I have told you this so that through me you may have peace. In the world you\u2019ll have trouble
 but be courageous\u2014I\u2019ve overcome the world!\u201d","After Jesus had said this
 he looked up to heaven and said
 \u201cFather
 the hour has come. Glorify your Son

 the only true God
 and the one whom you sent\u2014Jesus the Messiah. ","I glorified you on earth by completing the task you gave me to do.","\u201cSo now
 Father
 glorify me in your presence with the glory I had with you before the world existed. ","I have made your name known to these men whom you gave me from the world. They were yours
 and you gave them to me
 and they have kept your word. ","Now they realize that everything you gave me comes from you
 ","because the words that you gave me I passed on to them. They have received them and know for sure that I came from you. They have believed that you sent me.","\u201cI am asking on their behalf. I am not asking on behalf of the world
 but on behalf of those you gave me
 because they are yours. ","All that is mine is yours
 and what is yours is mine
 and I have been glorified through them. ","I am no longer in the world
 but they are in the world
 and I am coming to you. Holy Father
 protect them by your Name
 the Name that you gave me
 so that they may be one
 as we are one. ","While I was with them
 I protected them by the authority that you gave me. I guarded them
 and not one of them became lost except the one who was destined for destruction
 so that the Scripture might be fulfilled.","\u201cAnd now I am coming to you
 and I say these things in the world so that they may have my joy made complete in themselves. ","I have given them your word
 and the world has hated them
 because they do not belong to the world
 just as I don\u2019t belong to the world. ","I\u2019m not asking you to take them out of the world but to protect them from the evil one.","They don\u2019t belong to the world
 just as I don\u2019t belong to the world.","\u201cSanctify them by the truth. Your word is truth.","Just as you sent me into the world
 so I have sent them into the world. ","It is for their sakes that I sanctify myself
 so that they
 too
 may be sanctified by the truth. ","I ask not only on behalf of these men
 but also on behalf of those who will believe in me through their message
 ","so that they may all be one. Just as you
 Father
 are in me and I am in you
 may they also be one in us
 so that the world may believe that you sent me.","\u201cI have given them the glory that you gave me
 so that they may be one

 I want those you have given me to be with me where I am and to see my glory

 the world has never known you. Yet I have known you
 and these men have known that you sent me. ","I made your name known to them
 and will continue to make it known

 knowing everything that was going to happen
 went forward and asked them
 \u201cWho are you looking for?\u201d","They answered him
 \u201cJesus from Nazareth.\u201d Jesus told them
 \u201cI AM.\u201d Judas

\u201d they backed away and fell to the ground.","So he asked them again
 \u201cWho are you looking for?\u201d They said
 \u201cJesus from Nazareth.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cI told you that I am the one

 \u201cI have spoken publicly to the world. I have always taught in the synagogue or in the Temple

 and I have said nothing in secret. ","Why do you question me? Question those who heard what I said. These are the people who know what I said.\u201d","Jesus answered him
 \u201cIf I have said anything wrong
 tell me what it was. But if I have told the truth
 why do you hit me?\u201d ","Pilate told them
 \u201cYou take him and try him according to your Law.\u201d The Jewish leaders told him
 \u201cIt is not legal for us to put anyone to death.\u201d ","Jesus replied
 \u201cAre you asking this on your own initiative
 or did others tell you about me?\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cMy kingdom does not belong to this world. If my kingdom belonged to this world
 my servants would fight to keep me from being handed over to the Jewish leaders. But for now my kingdom is not from here.\u201d","Pilate asked him
 \u201cSo you are a king?\u201d Jesus answered
 \u201cYou say that I am a king. I was born for this
 and I came into the world for this: to testify to the truth. Everyone who is committed to the truth listens to my voice.\u201d","Pilate went outside again and told the Jews
 \u201cLook
 I am bringing him out to you to let you know that I find no basis for a charge against him.\u201d ","Then Jesus came outside
 wearing the victor\u2019s crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate told them

 \u201cYou have no authority over me at all
 except what was given to you from above. That\u2019s why the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin.\u201d","Now it was the Preparation Day for the Passover
 about noon. He told the Jewish leaders
 \u201cHere is your king!\u201d","When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he kept loving standing there
 he told his mother

 \u201cPeace be with you. Just as the Father has sent me

 you will stretch out your hands
 and someone else will fasten your belt and take you where you don\u2019t want to go.\u201d ","Now he said this to show by what kind of death he would glorify God. After saying this
 Jesus told him
 \u201cKeep following me.\u201d","Jesus told him
 \u201cIf it\u2019s my will for him to remain until I come back
 how does that concern you? You must keep following me!\u201d ","So the rumor spread among the brothers that this disciple wasn\u2019t going to die. Yet Jesus didn\u2019t say to Peter that he wasn\u2019t going to die
 but
 \u201cIf it\u2019s my will for him to remain until I come back
 how does that concern you?\u201d","And they asked him
 What then? Art thou Elijah? And he said
 I am not. Art thou the prophet? And he answered
 No.","Then said they unto him
 Who art thou? that we may give an answer to those that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?","He said
 I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness
 Make straight the way of the Lord
 as said the prophet Isaiah.","Then Jesus turned and saw them following and said unto them
 What seek ye? They said unto him
 Rabbi (which is to say
 being interpreted
 Master)
 where dwellest thou?","He said unto them
 Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt and abode with him that day
 for it was about the tenth hour.","And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him
 he said
 Thou art Simon the son of Jonah: thou shalt be called Cephas
 which is by interpretation
 A stone.","The day following Jesus desired to go forth into Galilee and found Philip and said unto him
 Follow me.","Philip found Nathanael and said unto him
 We have found him of whom Moses in the law and the prophets wrote: Jesus of Nazareth
 the son of Joseph.","And Nathanael said unto him
 Can any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip said unto him
 Come and see.","Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him and said of him
 Behold a true Israelite
 in whom is no guile!","Nathanael said unto him
 From where dost thou know me? Jesus answered and said unto him
 Before Philip called thee
 when thou wast under the fig tree
 I saw thee.","Jesus answered and said unto him
 Because I said unto thee
 I saw thee under the fig tree
 believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.","And he said unto him
 Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 Hereafter ye shall see the heaven open and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.","Jesus said unto her
 Woman
 what have I to do with thee? My hour is not yet come.","Jesus said unto them
 Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.","And he said unto them
 Draw out now and bear unto the butler. And they bore it.","and said unto those that sold the doves
 Take these things away from here; do not make my Father\u2019s house a house of merchandise.","Jesus answered and said unto them
 Dissolve this temple
 and in three days I will raise it up.","Jesus answered and said unto him
 Verily
 verily
 I say unto thee
 Except a person be born again from above
 he cannot see the kingdom of God.","Jesus answered
 Verily
 verily
 I say unto thee
 Unless a man is born of water and of the Spirit
 he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.","That which is born of the flesh is flesh
 and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.","Marvel not that I said unto thee
 Ye must be born again from above.","The wind blows where it desires
 and thou hearest the sound of it
 but canst not tell from where it comes or where it goes; so is every one that is born of the Spirit.","Jesus answered and said unto him
 Art thou a teacher of Israel and knowest not this?","Verily
 verily
 I say unto thee that we speak what we know and testify that which we have seen
 and ye do not receive our witness.","If I have told you earthly things and ye do not believe
 how shall ye believe if I tell you of heavenly things?","And no one has ascended up to the heaven but he that came down from the heaven
 even the Son of man
 who is in the heaven.","And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness
 even so must the Son of man be lifted up
","that whosoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.","For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son
 that whosoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.","For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world
 but that the world through him might be saved.","He that believes on him is not condemned
 but he that does not believe is condemned already because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.","And this is the condemnation
 that the light is come into the world
 and men loved darkness more than the light because their deeds were evil.","For every one that does evil hates the light
 and does not come to the light
 lest his deeds should be reproved.","But he that does truth comes to the light
 that his deeds may be made manifest
 that they are wrought in God.","And they came unto John and said unto him
 Rabbi
 he that was with thee beyond Jordan of whom thou gave witness
 behold
 the same baptizes
 and all men come to him.","There came a woman of Samaria to draw water; Jesus said unto her
 Give me to drink.","Jesus answered and said unto her
 If thou knewest the gift of God and who it is that saith to thee
 Give me to drink
 thou wouldest have asked of him
 and he would have given thee living water.","Jesus answered and said unto her
 Whosoever drinks of this water shall thirst again
","but whosoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst
 but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life.","The woman said unto him
 Lord
 give me this water
 that I not thirst
 neither come here to draw.","Jesus said unto her
 Go
 call thy husband and come here.","The woman answered and said
 I have no husband. Jesus said unto her
 Thou hast well said
 I have no husband;","for thou hast had five husbands
 and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband; this hast thou said with truth.","Jesus said unto her
 Woman
 believe me
 the hour comes when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem shall ye worship the Father.","Ye worship what ye know not; we worship what we know
 for saving health is of the Jews.","But the hour comes
 and now is
 when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth
 for the Father seeks such to worship him.","God is a Spirit and those that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.","Jesus said unto her
 I AM that speak unto thee.","But he said unto them
 I have a food to eat that ye know not of.","Jesus said unto them
 My food is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work.","Do ye not say
 There are yet four months and then comes harvest? Behold
 I say unto you
 Lift up your eyes and look on the fields
 for they are white already to harvest.","And he that reaps receives wages and gathers fruit unto eternal life
 that both he that sows and he that reaps may rejoice together.","And herein is that saying true
 One sows and another reaps.","I have sent you to reap that upon which ye bestowed no labour; others laboured
 and ye have entered into their labours.","and said unto the woman
 Now we believe
 not because of thy speech; for we have heard him ourselves and know that this is indeed the Christ
 the Saviour of the world.","Then Jesus said unto him
 Except ye see signs and wonders
 ye will not believe.","Jesus said unto him
 Go; thy son lives. And the man believed the word that Jesus spoke unto him
 and he went.","Then he enquired of them the hour when he began to get better. And they said unto him
 Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.","So the father knew that it was at the same hour in which Jesus said unto him
 Thy son lives; and he believed
 and his whole house.","When Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had been now a long time in that case
 he said unto him
 Dost thou desire to be made whole?","Jesus said unto him
 Rise
 take up thy bed
 and walk.","He answered them
 He that made me whole
 the same said unto me
 Take up thy bed and walk.","Afterward Jesus found him in the temple and said unto him
 Behold
 thou art made whole; sin no more
 lest a worse thing come unto thee.","But Jesus answered them
 My Father works until now
 and I work.","Then Jesus answered and said unto them
 Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 The Son can do nothing of himself but what he sees the Father do; for all that he does
 this also the Son does together with him.","For the Father loves the Son and shows him all the things that he does
 and he will show him greater works than these that ye may marvel.","For as the Father raises up the dead and gives them life; even so the Son gives life unto whom he will.","For the Father judges no man but has committed all judgment unto the Son","that everyone should honour the Son
 even as they honour the Father. He that does not honour the Son does not honour the Father who has sent him.","Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 He that hears my word and believes him that sent me has eternal life and shall not come into judgment but has passed from death unto life.","Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 The hour shall come
 and now is
 when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God
 and they that hear shall live.","For as the Father has life in himself
 so has he given to the Son to have life in himself","and has also given him power and authority to execute judgment because he is the Son of man.","Marvel not at this
 for an hour shall come when all that are in the graves shall hear his voice
","and those that have done good shall come forth unto the resurrection of life; but those that have done evil
 unto the resurrection of judgment.","I can of my own self do nothing; as I hear
 I judge
 and my judgment is just because I seek not my own will
 but the will of the Father who has sent me.","If I bear witness of myself
 my witness is not true.","There is another that bears witness of me
 and I know that the witness which he witnesses of me is true.","Ye sent unto John
 and he bore witness unto the truth.","But I receive not testimony from man
 but I say these things that ye might be saved.","He was a burning and a shining light
 and ye were willing to rejoice for one hour in his light.","But I have greater testimony than that of John; for the works which the Father has given me to finish
 the same works that I do
 bear witness of me that the Father has sent me.","And the Father himself
 who has sent me
 has borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his appearance.","And ye do not have his word abiding in you; for whom he has sent
 him ye do not believe.","Search the scriptures
 for in them ye think ye have eternal life; and they are those who testify of me.","And ye will not come to me
 that ye might have life.","I do not receive glory from men.","But I know you that ye have not the love of God in you.","I have come in my Father\u2019s name
 and ye receive me not; if another shall come in his own name
 him ye will receive.","How can ye believe
 who take glory one from another
 and seek not the glory that comes only from God?","Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father; there is one that accuses you
 even Moses
 in whom ye trust.","For had ye believed Moses
 ye would have believed me
 for he wrote of me.","But if ye do not believe his writings
 how shall ye believe my words?","Then Jesus lifted up his eyes and saw a great company come unto him; he said unto Philip
 From where shall we buy bread that these may eat?","Then Jesus said
 Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down
 in number about five thousand.","When they were filled
 he said unto his disciples
 Gather up the fragments that remain that nothing be lost.","But he said unto them
 I AM; be not afraid.","Jesus answered them and said
 Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 Ye seek me
 not because ye have seen the signs
 but because ye ate of the loaves and were filled.","Labour not for the food which perishes
 but for the food which abides unto eternal life
 which the Son of man shall give unto you
 for him has God the Father sealed.","Jesus answered and said unto them
 This is the work of God
 that ye believe in him whom he has sent.","Then Jesus said unto them
 Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 Moses gave you not that bread from the heaven
 but my Father gives you the true bread from the heaven.","For the bread of God is he who descended from heaven and gives life unto the world.","And Jesus said unto them
 I AM the bread of life; he that comes to me shall never hunger
 and he that believes in me shall never thirst.","But I said unto you
 That even though ye have seen me
 ye do not believe.","All that the Father gives me shall come to me
 and he that comes to me I will in no wise cast out.","For I came down from the heaven
 not to do my own will
 but the will of him that sent me.","And this is the Father\u2019s will who has sent me
 that of all whom he has given me I should lose nothing but should raise it up again in the last day.","And this is the will of him that sent me
 That every one who sees the Son and believes in him may have eternal life
 and I will raise him up in the last day.","Jesus therefore answered and said unto them
 Murmur not among yourselves.","No one can come to me unless the Father who has sent me draws him
 and I will raise him up in the last day.","It is written in the prophets
 And they shall all be taught of God. Every man therefore that has heard from the Father and has learned comes unto me.","Not that anyone has seen the Father
 except he who is of God
 he has seen the Father.","Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 He that believes in me has eternal life.","I AM the bread of life.","Your fathers ate manna in the wilderness and are dead.","This is the bread which comes down from heaven
 that anyone may eat of it and not die.","I AM the living bread which came down from heaven; if anyone eats of this bread
 they shall live for ever; and the bread that I will give is my flesh
 which I will give for the life of the world.","Then Jesus said unto them
 Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 Unless ye eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood
 ye shall have no life in you.","Whosoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life
 and I will raise him up at the last day.","For my flesh is food indeed
 and my blood is drink indeed.","He that eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me
 and I in him.","As the living Father has sent me
 and I live by the Father
 so he that eats me
 he shall also live by me.","This is the bread which came down from heaven; not as your fathers ate manna and are dead; he that eats of this bread shall live eternally.","But Jesus
 knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at it
 said unto them
 Does this offend you?","What if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?","The Spirit is he that gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words that I have spoken unto you
 they are Spirit and they are life.","But there are some of you that do not believe. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that did not believe and who should betray him.","And he said
 Therefore I said unto you that no one can come unto me unless it is given unto them of my Father.","Then Jesus said unto the twelve
 Will ye also go away?","Jesus answered them
 Have not I chosen you twelve
 and one of you is a devil?","His brethren therefore said unto him
 Depart from this place and go into Judea that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.","Then Jesus said unto them
 My time is not yet come
 but your time is always ready.","The world cannot hate you
 but it hates me because I testify of it that its works are evil.","Go ye up unto this feast; I go not up yet unto this feast
 for my time is not yet fulfilled.","Jesus answered them and said
 My doctrine is not mine
 but his that sent me.","If anyone desires to do his will
 he shall know of the doctrine
 whether it is of God or whether I speak of myself.","He that speaks of himself seeks his own glory
 but he that seeks the glory of him that sent him
 the same is true
 and no unrighteousness is in him.","Did not Moses give you the law
 and yet none of you keeps the law? Why do ye go about to kill me?","Jesus answered and said unto them
 I have done one work
 and ye all marvel.","Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision (not because it is of Moses
 but of the fathers)
 and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man.","If a man on the sabbath day receives circumcision without the law of Moses being broken
 are ye angry at me because I have made a man entirely whole on the sabbath day?","Judge not according to the appearance
 but judge with righteous judgment.","Then one of those of Jerusalem said
 Is not this he whom they seek to kill?","Then Jesus cried out in the temple as he taught
 saying
 Ye know me
 and ye know from where I come
 but I have not come of myself
 but he that sent me is true
 whom ye know not.","But I know him
 for I am from him
 and he has sent me.","Then Jesus said unto them
 Yet a little while I shall be with you
 and then I shall go unto him that sent me.","Ye shall seek me and shall not find me
 and where I shall be
 ye shall not be able to come.","Then the Jews said among themselves
 Where will he go that we shall not find him? Will he go unto the dispersed among the Greeks and teach the Greeks?","In the last day
 that great day of the feast
 Jesus stood and cried out
 saying
 If any man thirsts
 let him come unto me and drink.","He that believes in me
 as the scripture has said
 out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.","(But this he spoke concerning the Spirit
 which those that believe on him should receive
 for the Holy Spirit was not yet given because Jesus was not yet glorified.)","they said unto him
 Master
 this woman was taken in adultery in the very act.","So when they continued asking him
 he lifted himself up and said unto them
 He that is without sin among you
 let him be the first to cast a stone at her.","Jesus
 lifting himself up and seeing no one but the woman
 said unto her
 Woman
 where are thine accusers? Has no one condemned thee?","And she said
 No one
 Lord. Then Jesus said unto her
 Neither do I condemn thee; go and sin no more.","Then Jesus spoke again unto them
 saying
 I AM the light of the world; he that follows me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life.","Jesus answered and said unto them
 Though I bear witness of myself
 my witness is true
 for I know from where I came and where I go; but ye do not know where I came from and where I go.","Ye judge after the flesh
 but I judge no one.","And yet if I judge
 my judgment is true
 for I am not alone
 but I and the Father that sent me.","It is also written in your law that the testimony of two men is true.","I AM one that bears witness of myself
 and the Father that sent me bears witness of me.","Then they said unto him
 Where is thy Father? Jesus answered
 Ye neither know me
 nor my Father; if ye had known me
 ye should have known my Father also.","Then Jesus said again unto them
 I am going away
 and ye shall seek me
 but ye shall die in your sins; where I go
 ye shall not be able to come.","And he said unto them
 Ye are from below
 I am from above; ye are of this world
 I am not of this world.","Therefore I said unto you that ye shall die in your sins
 for if ye do not believe that I AM
 ye shall die in your sins.","And said they unto him
 Who art thou? Then Jesus said unto them
 He that I said unto you also from the beginning.","I have many things to say and to judge regarding you
 but he that sent me is true; and those things which I have heard of him
 I speak in the world.","Then Jesus said unto them
 When ye have lifted up the Son of man
 then ye shall know that I AM and that I do nothing of myself
 but as my Father has taught me
 I speak these things.","And he that sent me is with me: the Father has not left me alone
 for I always do those things that please him.","Then Jesus said to those Jews who had believed him
 If ye abide in my word
 ye shall be my disciples indeed;","and ye shall know the truth
 and the truth shall set you free.","Jesus answered them
 Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 Whosoever commits sin is the slave of sin.","And the slave does not abide in the house for ever
 but the Son abides for ever.","If the Son therefore shall set you free
 ye shall be free indeed.","I know that ye are Abraham\u2019s seed
 but ye seek to kill me because my word has no place in you.","I speak that which I have seen with my Father
 and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.","They answered and said unto him
 Abraham is our father. Jesus said unto them
 If ye were Abraham\u2019s sons
 ye would do the works of Abraham.","But now ye seek to kill me
 a man that has told you the truth
 which I have heard of God; Abraham did not do this.","Ye do the deeds of your father. Then they said to him
 We are not born of fornication; we have one Father
 even God.","Jesus said unto them
 If God were your Father
 ye would surely love me
 for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither did I come of myself
 but he sent me.","Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word.","Ye are of your father the devil
 and the desires of your father ye desire to do. He was a murderer from the beginning and abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie
 he speaks of his own
 for he is a liar and the father of it.","And because I tell you the truth
 ye do not believe me.","Which of you reproves me of sin? And if I say the truth
 why do ye not believe me?","He that is of God hears God\u2019s words; ye therefore hear them not because ye are not of God.","Jesus answered
 I do not have a demon; but I honour my Father
 and ye do dishonour me.","And I seek not my own glory; there is one that seeks it and judges.","Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 If anyone keeps my word
 he shall not see death forever.","Then the Jews said unto him
 Now we know that thou hast a demon. Abraham died and the prophets; and thou sayest
 If a man keeps my word
 he shall not taste death forever?","Jesus answered
 If I glorify myself
 my glory is nothing; it is my Father that glorifies me
 of whom ye say that he is your God;","yet ye have not known him
 but I know him; and if I should say
 I do not know him
 I shall be a liar like unto you; but I know him and keep his word.","Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day
 and he saw it and was glad.","Jesus said unto them
 Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 Before Abraham was
 I AM.","Jesus answered
 Neither has this man sinned nor his parents
 but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.","It is expedient that I do the works of him that sent me while it is day; the night comes
 when no one can work.","As long as I am in the world
 I am the light of the world.","and said unto him
 Go
 wash in the pool of Siloam (which is by interpretation
 Sent). Then he went and washed and came back seeing.","He answered and said
 A man that is called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes and said unto me
 Go to the pool of Siloam
 and wash; and I went and washed
 and I received sight.","Then said they unto him
 Where is he? He said
 I know not.","Then they called again the man that had been blind and said unto him
 Give glory to God; we know that this man is a sinner.","He answered and said
 Whether he is a sinner or not
 I do not know; one thing I know
 that having been blind
 now I see.","Then said they to him again
 What did he do to thee? How did he open thine eyes?","He answered them
 I have told you already
 and ye have heard; what more would ye hear? Do ye also desire to be his disciples?","Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and finding him
 he said unto him
 Dost thou believe in the Son of God?","And Jesus said unto him
 Thou hast seen him
 and it is he that talks with thee.","And Jesus said
 For judgment I have come into this world
 that those who do not see might see and that those who see might be blinded.","Jesus said unto them
 If ye were blind
 ye should have no sin; but now because ye say
 We see
 therefore your sin abides.","Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 He that enters not by the door into the sheepfold
 but climbs up some other way
 the same is a thief and a robber.","But he that enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.","To him the porter opens
 and the sheep hear his voice
 and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.","And when he puts forth his own sheep
 he goes before them; and the sheep follow him
 for they know his voice.","And they will not follow a stranger
 but will flee from him
 for they do not know the voice of strangers.","Then said Jesus unto them again
 Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 I AM the door of the sheep.","All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers
 but the sheep did not hear them.","I AM the door; whosoever enters in by me shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture.","The thief comes not but for to steal and to kill and to destroy the sheep; I am come that they might have life and that they might have it in abundance.","I AM the good shepherd; the good shepherd gives his life for the sheep.","But the hireling
 who is not a shepherd
 whose own the sheep are not
 sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees; and the wolf catches them and scatters the sheep.","The hireling flees because he is a hireling
 and the sheep do not belong to him.","I AM the good shepherd
 and know my sheep and am known of mine.","As the Father knows me
 even so I know the Father
 and I lay down my soul for the sheep.","And I have other sheep which are not of this fold; it is expedient that I bring them also
 and they shall hear my voice
 and there shall be one fold and one shepherd.","Therefore does my Father love me
 because I lay down my soul that I might take it again.","No man takes it from me
 but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down
 and I have power to take it again. This commandment I have received of my Father.","Jesus answered them
 I have told you
 and ye do not believe; the works that I do in my Father\u2019s name
 they bear witness of me.","But ye believe not because ye are not of my sheep
 as I said unto you.","My sheep hear my voice
 and I know them
 and they follow me;","and I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish
 neither shall anyone pluck them out of my hand.","My Father
 who gave them to me
 is greater than all; and no one is able to pluck them out of my Father\u2019s hand.","I and my Father are one.","Jesus answered them
 Many good works have I showed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?","Jesus answered them
 Is it not written in your law
 I said
 Ye are gods?","If he called them gods unto whom the word of God came (and the scripture cannot be broken)
","do ye say of him whom the Father has sanctified and sent into the world
 Thou blasphemest
 because I said
 I am the Son of God?","If I do not do the works of my Father
 do not believe me.","But if I do
 though ye do not believe me
 believe the works that ye may know and believe that the Father is in me and I in him.","When Jesus heard that
 he said
 This sickness is not unto death
 but for the glory of God
 that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.","Then after that he said to his disciples
 Let us go into Judea again.","Jesus answered
 Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the day
 he does not stumble because he sees the light of this world.","But he who walks in the night stumbles because there is no light in him.","Having said that he said unto them
 Our friend Lazarus sleeps
 but I go that I may awake him out of sleep.","Then Jesus said unto them plainly
 Lazarus has died.","And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there
 in order that ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.","Then Thomas said
 who is called Didymus
 unto his fellowdisciples
 Let us go also
 that we may die with him.","Jesus said unto her
 Thy brother shall rise again.","Jesus said unto her
 I AM the resurrection and the life; he that believes in me
 though he is dead
 yet shall he live;","and whosoever lives and believes in me shall never die. Believest thou this?","She said unto him
 Yes
 Lord
 I believe that thou art the Christ
 the Son of God
 who should come into the world.","Then when Mary was come where Jesus was and saw him
 she fell down at his feet
 saying unto him
 Lord
 if thou hadst been here
 my brother would not have died.","and said
 Where have ye laid him? They said unto him
 Lord
 come and see.","Jesus said
 Take ye away the stone. Martha
 the sister of him that had died
 said unto him
 Lord
 by this time he stinks
 for he has been dead four days.","Jesus said unto her
 Did I not say unto thee that if thou wouldest believe thou shalt see the glory of God?","Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus
 lifting up his eyes
 said
 Father
 I thank thee that thou hast heard me.","And I knew that thou hearest me always
 but because of the people who stand by I said it
 that they may believe that thou hast sent me.","And having said these things
 he cried with a loud voice
 Lazarus
 come forth.","Then he that had been dead came forth
 bound hand and foot with graveclothes
 and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus said unto them
 Loose him
 and let him go.","Therefore Jesus said
 Let her alone; against the day of my burying she has kept this;","for the poor ye always have with you
 but ye shall not always have me.","The multitude
 therefore
 that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave and raised him from the dead
 bore witness.","The Pharisees therefore said among themselves
 Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold
 the world is gone after him.","the same came therefore to Philip
 who was of Bethsaida of Galilee
 and asked him
 saying
 Lord
 we desire to see Jesus.","And Jesus answered them
 saying
 The hour comes in which the Son of man shall be clarified.","Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 Except the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies
 it abides alone; but if it dies
 it brings forth much fruit.","He that loves his life shall lose it
 and he that hates his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.","If anyone serves me
 let them follow me; and where I am
 there shall my servant be also; the one that serves me
 will my Father honour.","Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father
 save me from this hour
 but for this have I come in this hour.","Father
 clarify thy name. Then there came a voice from the heaven
 saying
 I have clarified it and will clarify it again.","Jesus answered and said
 This voice came not because of me
 but for your sakes.","Now is the judgment of this world; now shall the prince of this world be cast out.","And I
 if I be lifted up from the earth
 will draw all men unto me.","Then Jesus said unto them
 Yet a little while is the Light with you. Walk while ye have the light
 lest darkness come upon you; for he that walks in darkness does not know where he goes.","While ye have the Light
 believe in the Light that ye may be the sons of light. Jesus spoke these things and departed and hid himself from them.","But Jesus cried and said
 He that believes in me
 believes not in me
 but in him that sent me
","and he that sees me sees him that sent me.","I am come as a light into the world that whosoever believes in me should not abide in darkness.","And if anyone hears my words and believes not
 I judge him not
 for I came not to judge the world but to save the world.","He that rejects me and does not receive my words has one that judges him: the word that I have spoken
 the same shall judge him in the last day.","For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father who sent me
 he gave me a commandment
 what I should say and what I should speak.","And I know that his commandment is eternal life; whatsoever I speak therefore
 even as the Father said unto me
 so I speak.","Jesus answered and said unto him
 What I do thou dost not understand now
 but thou shalt understand afterwards.","Peter said unto him
 Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him
 If I wash thee not
 thou shalt have no part with me.","Jesus said to him
 He that is washed needs only to wash his feet because he is completely clean
 and ye are clean
 but not all.","For he knew who should betray him; therefore
 said he
 Ye are not all clean.","So after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and had sat down again
 he said unto them
 Know ye what I have done to you?","Ye call me Master and Lord; and ye say well
 for so I am.","If I then
 the Lord and the Master
 have washed your feet
 ye also ought to wash one another\u2019s feet.","For I have given you an example that ye should do as I have done to you.","Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 The slave is not greater than his lord; neither is the apostle greater than he that sent him.","If ye know these things
 ye shall be blessed if ye do them.","I speak not of you all; I know whom I have chosen; but that the scripture may be fulfilled
 He that eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me
","now I tell you before it is done
 so that
 when it is come to pass
 ye may believe that I AM.","Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 He that receives whomsoever I send receives me
 and he that receives me receives him that sent me.","When Jesus had thus said
 he was troubled in spirit and testified and said
 Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 that one of you shall betray me.","Jesus answered
 He it is to whom I shall give a sop when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop
 he gave it to Judas Iscariot
 the son of Simon.","And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then Jesus said unto him
 That which thou shalt do
 do it more quickly.","Therefore
 when he was gone out
 Jesus said
 Now is the Son of man clarified
 and God is clarified in him.","If God is clarified in him
 God shall also clarify him in himself and shall straightway clarify him.","Little children
 yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me; and as I said unto the Jews
 Where I go
 ye cannot come
 so now I say to you.","A new commandment I give unto you
 That ye love one another; as I have loved you
 that ye also love one another.","By this shall everyone know that ye are my disciples
 if ye have love one to another.","Simon Peter said unto him
 Lord
 where goest thou? Jesus answered him
 Where I go
 thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards.","Jesus answered him
 Wilt thou lay down thy soul for my sake? Verily
 verily
 I say unto thee
 The cock shall not crow until thou hast denied me three times.","Let not your heart be troubled; ye believe in God
 believe also in me.","In my Father\u2019s house are many dwelling places; if it were not so
 I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.","And if I go and prepare a place for you
 I will come again and take you unto myself; that where I am
 there ye may be also.","So that ye know where I go
 and ye know the way.","Jesus said unto him
 I AM the way
 the truth
 and the life; no one comes unto the Father
 but by me.","If ye had known me
 ye should have known my Father also; and from now on ye know him and have seen him.","Jesus said unto him
 Have I been such a long time with you
 and yet thou hast not known me
 Philip? He that has seen me has seen the Father; and how sayest thou then
 Show us the Father?","Believest thou not that I am in the Father and the Father in me? The words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself; but the Father that dwells in me
 he does the works.","Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father in me
 or else believe me for the very works\u2019 sake.","Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 He that believes in me
 the works that I do he shall do also; and greater works than these shall he do because I go unto my Father.","And whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name
 that will I do
 that the Father may be glorified in the Son.","If ye ask any thing in my name
 I will do it.","If ye love me
 keep my commandments;","and I will ask the Father
 and he shall give you another Comforter
 that he may abide with you for ever
","even the Spirit of truth
 whom the world cannot receive because it does not see him
 or know him; but ye know him
 for he dwells with you and shall be in you.","I will not leave you orphans; I will come to you.","Yet a little while
 and the world shall see me no more
 but ye shall see me; because I live
 ye shall live also.","At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father
 and ye in me
 and I in you.","He that has my commandments and keeps them
 he it is that loves me; and he that loves me shall be loved of my Father
 and I will love him and will manifest myself to him.","Judas
 not Iscariot
 said unto him
 Lord
 how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us and not unto the world?","Jesus answered and said unto him
 He who loves me will keep my words
 and my Father will love him
 and we will come unto him and dwell with him.","He that does not love me does not keep my words
 and the word which ye have heard is not mine
 but of the Father who sent me.","I have spoken these things unto you
 being yet present with you.","But the Comforter
 which is the Holy Spirit
 whom the Father will send in my name
 he shall teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all the things that I have said unto you.","Peace I leave with you
 my peace I give unto you; not as the world gives
 give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled
 neither let it be afraid.","Ye have heard how I said unto you
 I go away and come again unto you. If ye loved me
 ye would rejoice because I said
 I go unto the Father; for my Father is greater than I.","And now I have told you before it comes to pass
 that when it is come to pass
 ye might believe.","Hereafter I will not talk much with you
 for the prince of this world comes and has nothing in me.","But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment
 even so I do. Arise
 let us go from here.","I AM the true vine
 and my Father is the husbandman.","Every branch in me that does not bear fruit he shall take away; and every one that bears fruit
 he shall purge that they may bring forth more fruit.","Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.","Abide in me
 and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself
 except it abides in the vine
 no more can ye
 except ye abide in me.","I AM the vine
 ye are the branches: he that abides in me
 and I in him
 the same brings forth much fruit; for without me ye can do nothing.","He who does not abide in me shall be cast forth as an unsound branch and shall wither
 and they are gathered and cast into the fire and are burned.","If ye abide in me and my words abide in you
 ye shall ask what ye will
 and it shall be done unto you.","In this is my Father clarified
 in that ye bear much fruit; and in this manner ye shall be my disciples.","As the Father has loved me
 so I have loved you; abide in my love.","If ye keep my commandments
 ye shall abide in my love
 even as I have kept my Father\u2019s commandments and abide in his love.","These things I have spoken unto you that my joy may abide in you and that your joy might be fulfilled.","This is my commandment
 That ye love one another as I have loved you.","Greater love has no man than this
 that a man lay down his soul for his friends.","Ye are my friends if ye do whatsoever I command you.","From now on I do not call you slaves
 for the slave does not know what his lord does; but I have called you friends
 for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.","Ye have not chosen me
 but I have chosen you and ordained you
 that ye should go and bring forth fruit
 and that your fruit should remain; that whatever ye shall ask of the Father in my name
 he may give it unto you.","This I command you
 that ye love one another.","If the world hates you
 ye know that it hated me before it hated you.","If ye were of the world
 the world would love its own; but because ye are not of the world
 but I have chosen you out of the world
 therefore the world hates you.","Remember the word that I said unto you
 The slave is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me
 they will also persecute you; if they have kept my word
 they will keep yours also.","But they will do all these things unto you for my name\u2019s sake
 because they do not know him that sent me.","If I had not come and spoken unto them
 they would not have sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.","He that hates me hates my Father also.","If I had not done among them works which no other man has done
 they would not have sin; but now they have seen them and hate both me and my Father.","But this comes to pass that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law
 They hated me without a cause.","But when the Comforter is come
 whom I will send unto you from the Father
 even the Spirit of truth
 which proceeds from the Father
 he shall testify of me;","and ye also shall bear witness because ye have been with me from the beginning.","These things I have spoken unto you that ye should not be offended.","They shall put you out of the synagogues
 and the hour will even come when whosoever kills you will think that he does God service.","And they will do these things unto you because they do not know the Father
 nor me.","But I have told you these things that when that hour shall come
 ye may remember that I told you of them. And I did not say these things unto you at the beginning because I was with you.","But now I go unto him that sent me
 and none of you asks me
 Where goest thou?","But because I have said these things unto you
 sorrow has filled your heart.","Nevertheless I tell you the truth: It is expedient for you that I go away; for if I do not go away
 the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart
 I will send him unto you.","And when he is come
 he will reprove the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment:","of sin
 because they do not believe in me;","of righteousness
 because I go to my Father
 and ye see me no more;","of judgment
 because the prince of this world is judged.","I have yet many things to say unto you
 but ye cannot bear them now.","Howbeit when he
 the Spirit of truth
 is come
 he will guide you into all truth
 for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear
 that shall he speak
 and he will cause you to know the things which are to come.","He shall clarify me
 for he shall take of that which is mine and shall cause you to know it.","All that the Father has is mine; therefore I said that he shall take of that which is mine and shall cause you to know it.","A little while
 and ye shall not see me; and again
 a little while
 and ye shall see me
 because I go to the Father.","Then some of his disciples said among themselves
 What is this that he says unto us
 A little while
 and ye shall not see me; and again
 a little while
 and ye shall see me; and
 Because I go to the Father?","They said therefore
 What is this that he says
 A little while? we cannot understand what he says.","Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him and said unto them
 Do ye enquire among yourselves of what I said
 A little while
 and ye shall not see me; and again
 a little while
 and ye shall see me?","Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 That ye shall weep and lament
 and the world shall rejoice; but even though ye shall be sorrowful
 your sorrow shall be turned into joy.","The woman
 when she is in travail
 has pain
 because her hour is come; but as soon as she is delivered of the child
 she remembers the anguish no more
 for joy that a man is born into the world.","And ye now therefore have sorrow; but I will see you again
 and your heart shall rejoice
 and no one shall take your joy from you.","And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 Whatever ye shall ask the Father in my name
 he will give you.","Until now ye have asked nothing in my name; ask
 and ye shall receive
 that your joy may be fulfilled.","I have spoken these things unto you in proverbs
 but the hour comes when I shall no longer speak unto you in proverbs
 but I shall show you plainly of the Father.","In that day ye shall ask in my name
 and I do not say unto you that I will ask the Father for you;","for the Father himself loves you because ye have loved me and have believed that I came out from God.","I came forth from the Father and am come into the world; again
 I leave the world and go to the Father.","Jesus answered them
 Do ye now believe?","Behold
 the hour comes and is now come
 that ye shall be scattered
 each one to his own
 and shall leave me alone; and yet I am not alone
 because the Father is with me.","These things I have spoken unto you that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation; but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.","Jesus spoke these words and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said
 Father
 the hour is come; clarify thy Son
 that thy Son may also clarify thee
","as thou hast given him power over all flesh
 that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.","And this is life eternal
 that they might know thee the only true God and Jesus Christ
 whom thou hast sent.","I have clarified thee on the earth; I have finished the work which thou didst give me to do.","And now
 O Father
 clarify thou me with thine own self with that clarity which I had with thee before the world was.","I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou didst give me out of the world; thine they were
 and thou didst give them me; and they have kept thy word.","Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee.","For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received them and have known surely that I came out from thee
 and they have believed that thou didst send me.","I pray for them; I do not pray for the world
 but for those whom thou hast given me; for they are thine.","And all my things are thine
 and thine are mine; and I have been clarified in them.","And now I am no longer in the world
 but these are in the world
 and I come to thee. Holy Father
 those whom thou hast given me
 keep them in thy name
 that they may be one
 as we are.","While I was with them in the world
 I kept them in thy name; those that thou gavest me I have kept
 and none of them is lost
 but the son of perdition
 that the scripture might be fulfilled.","And now I come to thee; and these things I speak in the world that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.","I have given them thy word
 and the world has hated them because they are not of the world
 even as I am not of the world.","I do not pray that thou should take them out of the world
 but that thou should keep them from the evil.","They are not of the world
 even as I am not of the world.","Sanctify them in thy truth; thy word is the truth.","As thou hast sent me into the world
 even so have I also sent them into the world.","And for their sakes I sanctify myself
 that they also might be sanctified in the truth.","Neither do I pray for these alone
 but also for those who shall believe in me through their word;","that they all may be one; as thou
 Father
 art in me
 and I in thee
 that they also may be one in us
 that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.","And the clarity which thou gavest me I have given them
 that they may be one
 even as we are one:","I in them
 and thou in me
 that they may be perfect in one and that the world may know that thou hast sent me and hast loved them as thou hast loved me.","Father
 I will that they also
 whom thou hast given me
 be with me where I am
 that they may behold my clarity
 which thou hast given me
 for thou hast loved me from before the foundation of the world.","O righteous Father
 the world has not known thee; but I have known thee
 and these have known that thou hast sent me.","And I have manifested unto them thy name and will manifest it still
 that the love with which thou hast loved me may be in them
 and I in them.","Jesus therefore
 knowing all the things that should come upon him
 went forth
 and said unto them
 Whom seek ye?","They answered him
 Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus said unto them
 I AM. And Judas also
 who betrayed him
 stood with them.","And when he said unto them
 I AM
 they went backward and fell to the ground.","Then he asked them again
 Whom seek ye? And they said
 Jesus of Nazareth.","Jesus answered
 I have told you that I AM; if
 therefore
 ye seek me
 let these go away
","Then Jesus said unto Peter
 Put up thy sword into the sheath; the cup which my Father has given me
 shall I not drink it?","Then the damsel that kept the door said unto Peter
 Art not thou also one of this man\u2019s disciples? He said
 I am not.","Jesus answered him
 I spoke openly to the world; I always taught in the synagogue and in the temple
 where all the Jews gather; and I have said nothing in secret.","Why dost thou ask me? Ask those who heard me what I have said unto them; behold
 they know what I said.","Jesus answered him
 If I have spoken evil
 bear witness of the evil
 but if well
 why dost thou smite me?","Then Pilate said unto them
 Take him
 and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him
 It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death;","Jesus answered him
 Sayest thou this thing of thyself
 or did others tell it unto thee of me?","Jesus answered
 My kingdom is not of this world; if my kingdom were of this world
 then my servants would fight
 that I should not be delivered to the Jews; now
 therefore
 my kingdom is not from here.","Pilate therefore said unto him
 Art thou a king then? Jesus answered
 Thou sayest that I AM king. To this end I was born
 and for this cause I came into the world
 that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth hears my voice.","Pilate therefore went forth again and said unto them
 Behold
 I bring him forth to you
 that ye may know that I find no fault in him.","Then Jesus came forth
 wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. And Pilate said unto them
 Behold the man!","When the princes of the priests and the servants saw him
 they cried out
 saying
 crucify him
 crucify him. {Gr. stauroo \u2013 hang him on a stake} Pilate said unto them
 Take him
 and crucify him
 for I find no fault in him.","Jesus answered
 Thou could have no power at all against me
 unless it were given thee from above; therefore he that delivered me unto thee has the greater sin.","And it was the preparation of the passover and about the sixth hour; then he said unto the Jews
 Behold your King!","When Jesus therefore saw his mother and the disciple standing by
 whom he loved
 he said unto his mother
 Woman
 behold thy son!","Then he said to the disciple
 Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home.","After this
 Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished
 that the scripture might be fulfilled
 said
 I thirst.","When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar
 he said
 It is finished
 and he bowed his head and gave up the Spirit.","Then she ran and came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple
 whom Jesus loved
 and said unto them
 They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre
 and we know not where they have laid him.","And they said unto her
 Woman
 why dost thou weep? She said unto them
 Because they have taken away my Lord
 and I know not where they have laid him.","Jesus said unto her
 Woman
 why dost thou weep? whom seekest thou? She
 supposing him to be the gardener
 said unto him
 Lord
 if thou didst carry him off
 tell me where thou hast laid him
 and I will take him away.","Jesus said unto her
 Mary! Turning herself around
 she said unto him
 Rabboni
 which is to say
 Master.","Jesus said unto her
 Touch me not
 for I have not yet ascended to my Father; but go to my brethren and say unto them
 I ascend unto my Father and your Father
 and to my God and your God.","Then the same day at evening
 being the first of the sabbaths
 when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews
 Jesus came and stood in the midst and said unto them
 Peace be unto you.","Then Jesus said to them again
 Peace be unto you; as my Father has sent me
 even so send I you.","And when he had said this
 he breathed on them and said unto them
 Receive ye the Holy Spirit;","unto those whose sins ye release
 they shall be released; and unto those whose sins ye retain
 they shall be retained.","The other disciples
 therefore
 said unto him
 We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them
 Unless I shall see in his hands the print of the nails and put my finger into the print of the nails and thrust my hand into his side
 I will not believe.","And again eight days later
 his disciples were within and Thomas with them; then Jesus came
 the doors being shut
 and stood in the midst and said
 Peace be unto you.","Then he said to Thomas
 Reach here thy finger and behold my hands and reach here thy hand and thrust it into my side and be not unbelieving
 but faithful.","Jesus said unto him
 Thomas
 because thou hast seen me
 thou hast believed; blessed are those that have not seen and yet have believed.","Then Jesus said unto them
 Children
 have ye any food? They answered him
 No.","Jesus said unto them
 Bring of the fish which ye have now caught.","Jesus said unto them
 Come and dine. And none of the disciples dared to ask him
 Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.","So when they had dined
 Jesus said to Simon Peter
 Simon
 son of Jonas
 lovest thou me more than these? He said unto him
 Yes
 Lord
 thou knowest that I love thee. He said unto him
 Feed my lambs.","He said to him again the second time
 Simon
 son of Jonas
 lovest thou me? He said unto him
 Yes
 Lord thou knowest that I love thee. He said unto him
 Feed my sheep.","He said unto him the third time
 Simon
 son of Jonas
 lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time
 Lovest thou me? And he said
 Lord
 thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus said unto him
 Feed my sheep.","Verily
 verily
 I say unto thee
 When thou wast young
 thou didst gird thyself and walk where thou wouldest
 but when thou shalt be old
 thou shalt stretch forth thy hands
 and another shall gird thee and carry thee where thou wouldest not.","This he spoke
 signifying by what death he should clarify God. And when he had spoken this
 he said unto him
 Follow me.","Jesus said unto him
 If I will that he tarry until I come
 what is that to thee? follow thou me.","Then this saying went abroad among the brethren that that disciple should not die; yet Jesus did not say unto him
 He shall not die
 but
 If I will that he tarry until I come
 what is that to thee?","And they asked him
 \u201cWhat then? Art thou Elijah?\u201d And he said
 \u201cI am not.\u201d \u201cArt thou that Prophet?\u201d And he answered
 \u201cNo.\u201d","Then said they unto him
 \u201cWho art thou
 that we may give an answer to those who sent us? What sayest thou of thyself?\u201d","He said
 \u201cI am \u2018the voice of one crying in the wilderness
 \u201cMake straight the way of the Lord
\u201d\u2019 as said the prophet Isaiah.\u201d","Then Jesus turned and saw them following
 and said unto them
 \u201cWhat seek ye?\u201d They said unto Him
 \u201cRabbi\u201d (which is to say
 being interpreted
 \u201cMaster\u201d)
 \u201cwhere dwellest Thou?\u201d","He said unto them
 \u201cCome and see.\u201d They came and saw where He dwelt and stayed with Him that day
 for it was about the tenth hour.","And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him
 He said
 \u201cThou art Simon
 the son of Jonah. Thou shalt be called Cephas\u201d (which is by interpretation
 \u201ca stone\u201d).","The day following
 Jesus would go forth into Galilee
 and found Philip and said unto him
 \u201cFollow Me.\u201d","Philip found Nathanael and said unto him
 \u201cWe have found Him of whom Moses in the Law and the Prophets wrote: Jesus of Nazareth
 the son of Joseph.\u201d","And Nathanael said unto him
 \u201cCan any good thing come out of Nazareth?\u201d Philip said unto him
 \u201cCome and see.\u201d","Jesus saw Nathanael coming to Him
 and said of him
 \u201cBehold
 an Israelite indeed
 in whom is no guile!\u201d","Nathanael said unto Him
 \u201cHow knowest Thou me?\u201d Jesus answered and said unto him
 \u201cBefore Philip called thee
 when thou wast under the fig tree
 I saw thee.\u201d","Jesus answered and said unto him
 \u201cBecause I said unto thee
 \u2018I saw thee under the fig tree
\u2019 believest thou? Thou shalt see greater things than these.\u201d","And He said unto him
 \u201cVerily
 verily I say unto you
 hereafter ye shall see heaven open
 and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.\u201d","Jesus said unto her
 \u201cWoman
 what have I to do with thee? Mine hour is not yet come.\u201d","Jesus said unto them
 \u201cFill the waterpots with water.\u201d And they filled them up to the brim.","And He said unto them
 \u201cDraw some out now
 and bear it unto the governor of the feast.\u201d And they took it.","And He said unto those who sold doves
 \u201cTake these things hence! Make not My Father\u2019s house a house of merchandise!\u201d","Jesus answered and said unto them
 \u201cDestroy this temple
 and in three days I will raise it up.\u201d","Jesus answered and said unto him
 \u201cVerily
 verily I say unto thee
 unless a man be born again
 he cannot see the Kingdom of God.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cVerily
 verily I say unto thee
 unless a man be born of water and of the Spirit
 he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.","That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.","Marvel not that I said unto thee
 \u2018Ye must be born again.\u2019","The wind bloweth where it will
 and thou hearest the sound thereof
 but canst not tell whence it cometh and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.\u201d","Jesus answered and said unto him
 \u201cArt thou a master of Israel
 and knowest not these things?","Verily
 verily I say unto thee
 we speak what we know and testify what we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.","If I have told you earthly things and ye believe not
 how shall ye believe if I tell you of heavenly things?","And no man hath ascended up to Heaven
 but He that came down from Heaven
 even the Son of Man who is in Heaven.","And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness
 even so must the Son of Man be lifted up
","that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish
 but have eternal life.","\u201cFor God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son
 that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish
 but have everlasting life.","For God sent not His Son into the world to condemn the world
 but that the world through Him might be saved.","\u201cHe that believeth in Him is not condemned; but He that believeth not is condemned already
 because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.","And this is the condemnation: that Light is come into the world
 and men loved darkness rather than light
 because their deeds were evil.","For every one that doeth evil hateth the light
 neither cometh to the light
 lest his deeds should be reproved.","But he that doeth truth cometh to the light
 that his deeds may be made manifest
 that they are wrought in God.\u201d","And they came unto John and said unto him
 \u201cRabbi
 He that was with thee beyond the Jordan
 to whom thou bearest witness \u2014 behold
 the same baptizeth and all men come to Him.\u201d","There came a woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus said unto her
 \u201cGive Me to drink.\u201d","Jesus answered and said unto her
 \u201cIf thou knewest the gift of God and who it is that saith to thee
 \u2018Give Me to drink
\u2019 thou wouldest have asked of Him
 and He would have given thee living water.\u201d","Jesus answered and said unto her
 \u201cWhosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again
","but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.\u201d","The woman said unto Him
 \u201cSir
 give me this water
 that I thirst not
 neither come hither to draw.\u201d","Jesus said unto her
 \u201cGo
 call thy husband
 and come hither.\u201d","The woman answered and said
 \u201cI have no husband.\u201d Jesus said unto her
 \u201cThou hast well said
 \u2018I have no husband\u2019;","for thou hast had five husbands
 and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband. In that thou saidst truly.\u201d","Jesus said unto her
 \u201cWoman
 believe Me
 the hour cometh when ye shall neither on this mountain
 nor yet at Jerusalem
 worship the Father.","Ye worship ye know not what; we know what we worship
 for salvation is of the Jews.","But the hour cometh and now is
 when the true worshipers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth; for the Father seeketh such to worship Him.","God is a Spirit
 and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth.\u201d","Jesus said unto her
 \u201cI that speak unto thee am He.\u201d","But He said unto them
 \u201cI have meat to eat that ye know not of.\u201d","Jesus said unto them
 \u201cMy meat is to do the will of Him that sent Me
 and to finish His work.","Say not ye
 \u2018There are yet four months and then cometh the harvest\u2019? Behold
 I say unto you
 lift up your eyes and look on the fields
 for they are white already to harvest.","And he that reapeth receiveth wages and gathereth fruit unto life eternal
 that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.","And herein is that saying true
 \u2018One soweth and another reapeth.\u2019","I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labor; other men labored
 and ye have entered into their labors.\u201d","and said unto the woman
 \u201cNow we believe
 not because of thy saying
 for we have heard Him ourselves and know that this is indeed the Christ
 the Savior of the world.\u201d","Then Jesus said unto him
 \u201cUnless ye see signs and wonders
 ye will not believe.\u201d","Jesus said unto him
 \u201cGo thy way; thy son liveth.\u201d And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him
 and he went his way.","Then he inquired of them the hour when he began to be healed. And they said unto him
 \u201cYesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.\u201d","So the father knew that it was at the same hour in which Jesus had said unto him
 \u201cThy son liveth.\u201d And he himself believed
 and his whole house.","When Jesus saw him lying there
 and knew that he had been in that state a long time
 He said unto him
 \u201cWilt thou be made whole?\u201d","Jesus said unto him
 \u201cRise
 take up thy bed
 and walk.\u201d","He answered them
 \u201cHe that made me whole said unto me
 \u2018Take up thy bed and walk.\u2019\u201d","Afterward Jesus found him in the temple and said unto him
 \u201cBehold
 thou art made whole. Sin no more
 lest a worse thing come unto thee.\u201d","But Jesus answered them
 \u201cMy Father worketh hitherto
 and I work.\u201d","Then answered Jesus and said unto them
 \u201cVerily
 verily I say unto you
 the Son can do nothing of Himself
 but what He seeth the Father do; for what things soever He doeth
 these also doeth the Son likewise.","For the Father loveth the Son and showeth Him all things that He Himself doeth; and He will show Him greater works than these
 that ye may marvel.","For as the Father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them
 even so the Son quickeneth whom He will.","For the Father judgeth no man
 but hath committed all judgment unto the Son
","that all men should honor the Son
 even as they honor the Father. He that honoreth not the Son honoreth not the Father who hath sent Him.","Verily
 verily I say unto you
 he that heareth My Word and believeth in Him that sent Me
 hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation
 but is passed from death unto life.","\u201cVerily
 verily I say unto you
 the hour is coming and now is
 when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and they that hear shall live.","For as the Father hath life in Himself
 so hath He given to the Son to have life in Himself
","and hath given Him authority to execute judgment also
 because He is the Son of Man.","Marvel not at this; for the hour is coming in which all that are in the graves shall hear His voice","and shall come forth \u2014 they that have done good
 unto the resurrection of life
 and they that have done evil
 unto the resurrection of damnation.","\u201cI can of Mine own self do nothing. As I hear
 I judge; and My judgment is just
 because I seek not Mine own will
 but the will of the Father who hath sent Me.","If I bear witness of Myself
 My witness is not true.","There is Another that beareth witness of Me
 and I know that the witness which He witnesseth of Me is true.","\u201cYe sent unto John
 and he bore witness unto the truth.","But I receive not testimony from man
 but these things I say
 that ye might be saved.","He was a burning and a shining light
 and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.","But I have greater witness than that of John; for the works which the Father hath given Me to finish
 the same works that I do
 bear witness of Me that the Father hath sent Me.","And the Father Himself
 who hath sent Me
 hath borne witness of Me. Ye have neither heard His voice at any time
 nor seen His shape.","And ye have not His Word abiding in you; for Whom He hath sent
 Him ye believe not.","\u201cSearch the Scriptures
 for in them ye think ye have eternal life; and it is they which testify of Me.","And ye will not come to Me
 that ye might have life!","I receive not honor from men.","But I know you
 that ye have not the love of God in you.","I have come in My Father\u2019s name
 and ye receive Me not; if another shall come in his own name
 him ye will receive.","How can ye believe
 who receive honor one from another
 and seek not the honor that cometh from God only?","Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father. There is one that accuseth you
 even Moses
 in whom ye trust.","For had ye believed Moses
 ye would have believed Me
 for he wrote of Me.","But if ye believe not his writings
 how shall ye believe My words?\u201d","And when Jesus lifted up His eyes and saw a great company coming unto Him
 He said unto Philip
 \u201cWhence shall we buy bread
 that these may eat?\u201d","And Jesus said
 \u201cMake the men sit down.\u201d Now there was much grass in the place; so the men sat down
 in number about five thousand.","When they were filled
 He said unto His disciples
 \u201cGather up the fragments that remain
 that nothing be lost.\u201d","But He said unto them
 \u201cIt is I; be not afraid.\u201d","Jesus answered them and said
 \u201cVerily
 verily I say unto you
 ye seek Me
 not because ye saw the miracles
 but because ye ate of the loaves and were filled.","Labor not for the meat which perisheth
 but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life
 which the Son of Man shall give unto you; for on Him hath God the Father set His seal.\u201d","Jesus answered and said unto them
 \u201cThis is the work of God: that ye believe in Him whom He hath sent.\u201d","Then Jesus said unto them
 \u201cVerily
 verily I say unto you
 Moses gave you not that bread from Heaven
 but My Father giveth you the true bread from Heaven.","For the bread of God is He that cometh down from Heaven
 and giveth life unto the world.\u201d","And Jesus said unto them
 \u201cI am the Bread of Life. He that cometh to Me shall never hunger
 and he that believeth in Me shall never thirst.","But I said unto you that ye also have seen Me
 and believe not.","All that the Father giveth Me shall come to Me
 and him that cometh to Me I will in no wise cast out.","For I came down from Heaven
 not to do Mine own will
 but the will of Him that sent Me.","And this is the Father\u2019s will who hath sent Me
 that of all which He hath given Me I should lose nothing
 but should raise it up again at the Last Day.","And this is the will of Him that sent Me: that every one who seeth the Son and believeth in Him may have everlasting life
 and I will raise him up at the Last Day.\u201d","Jesus therefore answered and said unto them
 \u201cMurmur not among yourselves.","No man can come to Me unless the Father who hath sent Me draw him; and I will raise him up at the Last Day.","It is written in the Prophets: \u2018And they shall all be taught by God.\u2019 Every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned from the Father cometh unto Me.","Not that any man hath seen the Father
 save He that is of God; He hath seen the Father.","Verily
 verily I say unto you
 He that believeth in Me hath everlasting life.","I am that Bread of Life.","Your fathers ate manna in the wilderness
 and are dead.","This is the Bread which cometh down from Heaven
 that a man may eat thereof and not die.","I am the living Bread which came down from Heaven. If any man eat of this Bread
 he shall live for ever; and the Bread that I will give is My flesh
 which I will give for the life of the world.\u201d","Then Jesus said unto them
 \u201cVerily
 verily I say unto you
 unless ye eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood
 ye have no life in you.","Whoso eateth My flesh and drinketh My blood hath eternal life
 and I will raise him up at the Last Day.","For My flesh is meat indeed
 and My blood is drink indeed.","He that eateth My flesh and drinketh My blood dwelleth in Me
 and I in him.","As the living Father hath sent Me
 and I live by the Father
 so he that eateth Me
 even he shall live by Me.","This is that Bread which came down from Heaven
 not as your fathers ate manna and are dead; he that eateth of this Bread shall live for ever.\u201d","When Jesus knew in Himself that His disciples murmured at it
 He said unto them
 \u201cDoth this offend you?","What if ye shall see the Son of Man ascend up where He was before?","It is the Spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing. The words that I speak unto you
 they are spirit
 and they are life.","But there are some of you that believe not.\u201d For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who believed not and who should betray Him.","And He said
 \u201cTherefore said I unto you that no man can come unto Me
 unless it were given unto him by My Father.\u201d","Then Jesus said unto the twelve
 \u201cWill ye also go away?\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cHave not I chosen you twelve
 and one of you is a devil?\u201d","His brethren therefore said unto Him
 \u201cDepart hence and go into Judea
 that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.","Then Jesus said unto them
 \u201cMy time is not yet come
 but your time is always ready.","The world cannot hate you
 but Me it hateth
 because I testify of it that the works thereof are evil.","Go ye up unto this feast. I go not up yet unto this feast
 for My time is not yet fully come.\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cMy doctrine is not Mine
 but His that sent Me.","If any man will do His will
 he shall know of the doctrine whether it be from God
 or whether I speak from Myself.","He that speaketh from himself seeketh his own glory; but He that seeketh the glory of Him that sent Him
 the same is true
 and no unrighteousness is in Him.","Did not Moses give you the law
 and yet none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill Me?\u201d","Jesus answered and said unto them
 \u201cI have done one work
 and ye all marvel.","Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision (not because it is of Moses
 but of the fathers)
 and ye on the Sabbath day circumcise a man.","If a man receive circumcision on the Sabbath day
 that the Law of Moses should not be broken
 are ye angry at Me because I have made a man every whit whole on the Sabbath day?","Judge not according to the appearance
 but judge righteous judgment.\u201d","Then said some of them from Jerusalem
 \u201cIs not this he whom they seek to kill?","Then Jesus cried out in the temple as He taught
 saying
 \u201cYe both know Me
 and ye know from whence I am. And I am not come of Myself
 but He that sent Me is true
 whom ye know not.","But I know Him
 for I am from Him
 and He hath sent Me.\u201d","Then said Jesus unto them
 \u201cYet a little while am I with you
 and then I go unto Him that sent Me.","Ye shall seek Me
 and shall not find Me; and where I am
 thither ye cannot come.\u201d","Then the Jews said among themselves
 \u201cWhither will he go that we shall not find him? Will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles
 and teach the Gentiles?","On the last day
 that great day of the feast
 Jesus stood and cried out
 saying
 \u201cIf any man thirst
 let him come unto Me
 and drink.","He that believeth in Me
 as the Scripture hath said
 out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.\u201d","(But this He spoke of the Spirit
 whom those who believe in Him should receive; for the Holy Ghost was not yet given
 because Jesus was not yet glorified.)","they said unto Him
 \u201cMaster
 this woman was taken in adultery
 in the very act.","So when they continued asking Him
 He lifted Himself up and said unto them
 \u201cHe that is without sin among you
 let him first cast a stone at her.\u201d","When Jesus had lifted Himself up and saw none but the woman
 He said unto her
 \u201cWoman
 where are those thine accusers? Hath no man condemned thee?\u201d","She said
 \u201cNo man
 Lord.\u201d And Jesus said unto her
 \u201cNeither do I condemn thee; go
 and sin no more.\u201d","Then spoke Jesus again unto them
 saying
 \u201cI am the Light of the world. He that followeth Me shall not walk in darkness
 but shall have the light of life.\u201d","Jesus answered and said unto them
 \u201cThough I bear record of Myself
 yet My record is true
 for I know whence I came and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come and whither I go.","Ye judge according to the flesh; I judge no man.","And yet if I judge
 My judgment is true; for I am not alone
 but I and the Father that sent Me.","It is also written in your law that the testimony of two men is true.","I am One that bear witness of Myself
 and the Father that sent Me beareth witness of Me.\u201d","Then they said unto Him
 \u201cWhere is thy father?\u201d Jesus answered
 \u201cYe neither know Me
 nor My Father. If ye had known Me
 ye should have known My Father also.\u201d","Then Jesus said again unto them
 \u201cI go My way
 and ye shall seek Me
 and shall die in your sins. Whither I go
 ye cannot come.\u201d","And He said unto them
 \u201cYe are from beneath; I am from above. Ye are of this world; I am not of this world.","I said therefore unto you that ye shall die in your sins; for if ye believe not that I am He
 ye shall die in your sins.\u201d","Then they said unto Him
 \u201cWho art thou?\u201d And Jesus said unto them
 \u201cEven the same that I said unto you from the beginning.","I have many things to say and to judge of you
 but He that sent Me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of Him.\u201d","Then said Jesus unto them
 \u201cWhen ye have lifted up the Son of Man
 then shall ye know that I am He
 and that I do nothing of Myself; but as My Father hath taught Me
 I speak these things.","And He that sent Me is with Me. The Father hath not left Me alone
 for I do always those things that please Him.\u201d","Then said Jesus to those Jews who believed in Him
 \u201cIf ye continue in My Word
 then are ye My disciples indeed.","And ye shall know the truth
 and the truth shall make you free.\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cVerily
 verily I say unto you
 whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.","And the servant abideth not in the house for ever
 but the Son abideth ever.","If the Son therefore shall make you free
 ye shall be free indeed.","I know that ye are Abraham\u2019s seed
 but ye seek to kill Me
 because My Word hath no place in you.","I speak that which I have seen with My Father
 and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.\u201d","They answered and said unto Him
 \u201cAbraham is our father.\u201d Jesus said unto them
 \u201cIf ye were Abraham\u2019s children
 ye would do the works of Abraham.","But now ye seek to kill Me
 a Man that hath told you the truth
 which I have heard from God: this did not Abraham.","Ye do the deeds of your father.\u201d Then they said to Him
 \u201cWe are not born of fornication; we have one Father
 even God.\u201d","Jesus said unto them
 \u201cIf God were your Father
 ye would love Me
 for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of Myself
 but He sent Me.","Why do ye not understand My speech? Even because ye cannot hear My Word!","Ye are of your father the devil
 and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning
 and abode not in the truth
 because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie
 he speaketh of his own
 for he is a liar and the father of it.","And because I tell you the truth
 ye believe Me not.","Which of you convicteth Me of sin? And if I say the truth
 why do ye not believe Me?","He that is of God heareth God\u2019s words; ye therefore hear them not
 because ye are not of God.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cI have not a devil
 but I honor My Father
 and ye do dishonor Me.","And I seek not Mine own glory; there is One that seeketh and judgeth.","Verily
 verily I say unto you
 if a man keep My saying
 he shall never see death.\u201d","Then said the Jews unto Him
 \u201cNow we know that thou hast a devil! Abraham is dead and the prophets; and thou sayest
 \u2018If a man keep my saying he shall never taste of death.\u2019","Jesus answered
 \u201cIf I honor Myself
 My honor is nothing. It is My Father that honoreth Me
 of whom ye say that He is your God.","Yet ye have not known Him
 but I know Him. And if I should say
 \u2018I know Him not
\u2019 I shall be a liar like unto you. But I know Him and keep His saying.","Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day; and He saw it and was glad.\u201d","Jesus said unto them
 \u201cVerily
 verily I say unto you
 before Abraham was
 I am!\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cNeither hath this man sinned nor his parents
 but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.","I must work the works of Him that sent Me while it is day; the night cometh when no man can work.","As long as I am in the world
 I am the Light of the world.\u201d","and said unto him
 \u201cGo
 wash in the pool of Siloam\u201d (which interpreted means
 \u201cSent\u201d). He went his way therefore and washed
 and came back seeing.","He answered and said
 \u201cA man who is called Jesus made clay
 and anointed mine eyes
 and said unto me
 \u2018Go to the pool of Siloam and wash.\u2019 And I went and washed
 and I received sight.\u201d","Then they said unto him
 \u201cWhere is he?\u201d He said
 \u201cI know not.\u201d","Then they again called the man who was blind and said unto him
 \u201cGive God the praise! We know that this man is a sinner.\u201d","He answered and said
 \u201cWhether he be a sinner or not
 I know not. One thing I know
 that whereas I was blind
 now I see.\u201d","Then said they to him again
 \u201cWhat did he do to thee? How opened he thine eyes?\u201d","He answered them
 \u201cI have told you already
 and ye did not hear. Why would ye hear it again? Will ye also be his disciples?\u201d","Jesus heard that they had cast him out. And when He had found him
 He said unto him
 \u201cDost thou believe in the Son of God?\u201d","And Jesus said unto him
 \u201cThou hast both seen Him
 and it is He that talketh with thee.\u201d","And Jesus said
 \u201cFor judgment I am come into this world
 that they that see not might see
 and that they that see might be made blind.\u201d","Jesus said unto them
 \u201cIf ye were blind
 ye should have no sin; but now ye say
 \u2018We see.\u2019 Therefore your sin remaineth.","\u201cVerily
 verily I say unto you
 he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold
 but climbeth up some other way
 the same is a thief and a robber.","But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.","To him the doorkeeper openeth
 and the sheep hear his voice; and he calleth his own sheep by name and leadeth them out.","And when he putteth forth his own sheep
 he goeth before them and the sheep follow him
 for they know his voice.","And a stranger will they not follow
 but will flee from him
 for they know not the voice of strangers.\u201d","Then said Jesus unto them again
 \u201cVerily
 verily I say unto you
 I am the door of the sheep.","All that ever came before Me are thieves and robbers
 but the sheep did not hear them.","I am the door; by Me if any man enter in
 he shall be saved
 and shall go in and out
 and find pasture.","The thief cometh not but to steal and to kill and to destroy. I am come that they might have life
 and that they might have it more abundantly.","I am the Good Shepherd; the Good Shepherd giveth His life for the sheep.","But he that is a hireling and not the shepherd
 whose own the sheep are not
 seeth the wolf coming and leaveth the sheep and fleeth; and the wolf catcheth them and scattereth the sheep.","The hireling fleeth because he is a hireling
 and careth not for the sheep.","I am the Good Shepherd
 and know My sheep and am known by Mine.","As the Father knoweth Me
 even so know I the Father; and I lay down My life for the sheep.","And other sheep I have
 which are not of this fold. Them also I must bring
 and they shall hear My voice; and there shall be one fold and one Shepherd.","Therefore doth My Father love Me
 because I lay down My life
 that I might take it again.","No man taketh it from Me
 but I lay it down of Myself. I have power to lay it down
 and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received from My Father.\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cI told you
 and ye believed not. The works that I do in My Father\u2019s name
 they bear witness of Me.","But ye believe not
 because ye are not of My sheep
 as I said unto you.","My sheep hear My voice
 and I know them and they follow Me.","And I give unto them eternal life
 and they shall never perish
 neither shall any man pluck them out of My hand.","My Father
 who gave them to Me
 is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of My Father\u2019s hand.","I and My Father are one.\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cMany good works have I shown you from My Father. For which of those works do ye stone Me?\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cIs it not written in your law
 \u2018I said \u201cYe are gods\u201d\u2019?","If He called them gods unto whom the Word of God came (and the Scripture cannot be broken)
","do ye say of Him whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world
 \u2018Thou blasphemest
\u2019 because I said
 \u2018I am the Son of God\u2019?","If I do not the works of My Father
 believe Me not.","But if I do
 though ye believe not Me
 believe the works
 that ye may know and believe that the Father is in Me
 and I in Him.\u201d","When Jesus heard that
 He said
 \u201cThis sickness is not unto death
 but for the glory of God
 that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.\u201d","Then after that He said to His disciples
 \u201cLet us go into Judea again.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cAre there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day he stumbleth not
 because he seeth the light of this world.","But if a man walk in the night
 he stumbleth because there is no light in him.\u201d","These things said He
 and after that He said unto them
 \u201cOur friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go
 that I may awaken him out of sleep.\u201d","Then Jesus said unto them plainly
 \u201cLazarus is dead.","And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there
 to the intent that ye may believe. Nevertheless let us go unto him.\u201d","Then Thomas
 who was called Didymus
 said unto his fellow disciples
 \u201cLet us also go
 that we may die with Him.\u201d","Jesus said unto her
 \u201cThy brother shall rise again.\u201d","Jesus said unto her
 \u201cI am the resurrection and the Life. He that believeth in Me
 though he were dead
 yet shall he live;","and whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never die. Believest thou this?\u201d","She said unto Him
 \u201cYea
 Lord
 I believe that Thou art the Christ
 the Son of God
 who should come into the world.\u201d","Then when Mary had come where Jesus was and saw Him
 she fell down at His feet
 saying unto Him
 \u201cLord
 if Thou hadst been here
 my brother would not have died.\u201d","and said
 \u201cWhere have ye laid him?\u201d They said unto Him
 \u201cLord
 come and see.\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cTake ye away the stone.\u201d Martha
 the sister of him that was dead
 said unto Him
 \u201cLord
 by this time there is a stench
 for he hath been dead four days.\u201d","Jesus said unto her
 \u201cSaid I not unto thee that if thou would believe
 thou should see the glory of God?\u201d","Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up His eyes and said
 \u201cFather
 I thank Thee that Thou hast heard Me.","And I knew that Thou hearest Me always
 but because of the people who stand by I said it
 that they may believe that Thou hast sent Me.\u201d","And when He thus had spoken
 He cried with a loud voice
 \u201cLazarus
 come forth!\u201d","And he that was dead came forth
 bound hand and foot with graveclothes
 and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus said unto them
 \u201cLoose him
 and let him go.\u201d","Then Jesus said
 \u201cLet her alone; against the day of My burying hath she kept this.","For the poor always ye have with you
 but Me ye have not always.\u201d","The people therefore who were with Him
 when He called Lazarus out of his grave and raised him from the dead
 bore record.","The Pharisees therefore said among themselves
 \u201cPerceive ye how ye prevail not at all? Behold
 the world has gone after him!\u201d","They came therefore to Philip
 who was of Bethsaida of Galilee
 and asked him
 saying
 \u201cSir
 we would see Jesus.\u201d","And Jesus answered them
 saying
 \u201cThe hour is come that the Son of Man should be glorified.","Verily
 verily I say unto you
 unless a grain of wheat fall into the ground and die
 it abideth alone; but if it die
 it bringeth forth much fruit.","He that loveth his life shall lose it
 and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.","If any man serve Me
 let him follow Me; and where I am
 there shall also My servant be. If any man serve Me
 him will My Father honor.","\u201cNow is My soul troubled
 and what shall I say? \u2018Father
 save Me from this hour\u2019? But for this cause came I unto this hour.","Father
 glorify Thy name.\u201d Then there came a voice from Heaven
 saying
 \u201cI Have Both Glorified It
 And Will Glorify It Again.\u201d","Jesus answered and said
 \u201cThis voice came not because of Me
 but for your sakes.","Now is the judgment of this world; now shall the prince of this world be cast out.","And I
 if I be lifted up from the earth
 will draw all men unto Me.\u201d","Then Jesus said unto them
 \u201cYet a little while is the Light with you. Walk while ye have the Light
 lest darkness come upon you; for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.","While ye have Light
 believe in the Light
 that ye may be the children of Light.\u201d These things spoke Jesus
 and departed and hid Himself from them.","Jesus cried out and said
 \u201cHe that believeth in Me
 believeth not in Me
 but in Him that sent Me.","And he that seeth Me
 seeth Him that sent Me.","I am come a light into the world
 that whosoever believeth in Me should not abide in darkness.","And if any man hear My words and believe not
 I judge him not; for I came not to judge the world
 but to save the world.","He that rejecteth Me and receiveth not My words
 hath One that judgeth him; the Word that I have spoken
 the same shall judge him in the Last Day.","For I have not spoken of Myself; but the Father who sent Me
 He gave Me a commandment
 what I should say and what I should speak.","And I know that His commandment is life everlasting. Whatsoever I speak therefore
 even as the Father said unto Me
 so I speak.\u201d","Jesus answered and said unto him
 \u201cWhat I do thou knowest not now
 but thou shalt know hereafter.\u201d","Peter said unto Him
 \u201cThou shalt never wash my feet.\u201d Jesus answered him
 \u201cIf I wash thee not
 thou hast no part with Me.\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cHe that is washed needeth not but to wash his feet
 but is clean every whit. And ye are clean
 but not all.\u201d","(For He knew who would betray Him; therefore He said
 \u201cYe are not all clean.\u201d)","So after He had washed their feet and had taken His garments and had sat down again
 He said unto them
 \u201cKnow ye what I have done to you?","Ye call Me Master and Lord; and ye say well
 for so I am.","If I then
 your Lord and Master
 have washed your feet
 ye also ought to wash one another\u2019s feet.","For I have given you an example
 that ye should do as I have done to you.","Verily
 verily I say unto you
 the servant is not greater than his lord
 neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him.","If ye know these things
 happy are ye if ye do them.","\u201cI speak not of you all. I know whom I have chosen; but that the Scripture may be fulfilled
 \u2018He that eateth bread with Me hath lifted up his heel against Me.\u2019","Now I tell you before it come that
 when it is come to pass
 ye may believe that I am He.","Verily
 verily I say unto you
 he that receiveth whomsoever I send
 receiveth Me; and he that receiveth Me
 receiveth Him that sentMe.\u201d","When Jesus had thus said
 He was troubled in spirit
 and testified and said
 \u201cVerily
 verily I say unto you that one of you shall betray Me.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cHe it is to whom I shall give a sop when I have dipped it.\u201d And when He had dipped the sop
 He gave it to Judas Iscariot
 the son of Simon.","And after the sop
 Satan entered into him. Then Jesus said unto him
 \u201cWhat thou doest
 do quickly.\u201d","Therefore when he had gone out
 Jesus said
 \u201cNow is the Son of Man glorified
 and God is glorified in Him.","If God be glorified in Him
 God shall also glorify Him in Himself
 and shall straightway glorify Him.","Little children
 yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek Me; and as I said unto the Jews
 \u2018Whither I go ye cannot come
\u2019 so now say I to you.","A new commandment I give unto you: that ye love one another
 as I have loved you
 that ye also love one another.","By this shall all men know that ye are My disciples: if ye have love one for another.\u201d","Simon Peter said unto Him
 \u201cLord
 whither goest Thou?\u201d Jesus answered him
 \u201cWhither I go thou canst not follow Me now
 but thou shalt follow Me afterwards.\u201d","Jesus answered him
 \u201cWilt thou lay down thy life for My sake? Verily
 verily I say unto thee
 the cock shall not crow till thou hast denied Me thrice.","\u201cLet not your heart be troubled. Ye believe in God; believe also in Me.","In My Father\u2019s house are many mansions; if it were not so
 I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.","And if I go and prepare a place for you
 I will come again and receive you unto Myself
 that where I am
 there ye may be also.","And whither I go ye know
 and the way ye know.\u201d","Jesus said unto him
 \u201cI am the Way
 the Truth
 and the Life; no man cometh unto the Father
 but by Me.","If ye had known Me
 ye should have known My Father also; and from henceforth ye know Him
 and have seen Him.\u201d","Jesus said unto him
 \u201cHave I been so long a time with you
 and yet hast thou not known Me
 Philip? He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then
 \u2018Show us the Father\u2019?","Believest thou not that I am in the Father
 and the Father in Me? The words that I speak unto you I speak not of Myself; but the Father that dwelleth in Me
 He doeth the works.","Believe Me that I am in the Father
 and the Father in Me; or else believe Me for the very works\u2019 sake.","Verily
 verily I say unto you
 he that believeth in Me
 the works that I do he shall do also; and greater works than these shall he do
 because I go unto My Father.","And whatsoever ye shall ask in My name
 that will I do
 that the Father may be glorified in the Son.","If ye shall ask anything in My name
 I will do it.","\u201cIf ye love Me
 keep My commandments.","And I will pray the Father
 and He shall give you another Comforter
 that He may abide with you for ever\u201d","even the Spirit of Truth
 whom the world cannot receive
 because it seeth Him not
 neither knoweth Him. But ye know Him
 for He dwelleth with you
 and shall be in you.","\u201cI will not leave you comfortless; I will come to you.","Yet a little while and the world seeth Me no more
 but ye see Me. Because I live
 ye shall live also.","At that day ye shall know that I am in My Father
 and you in Me
 and I in you.","He that hath My commandments and keepeth them
 he it is that loveth Me; and he that loveth Me shall be loved by My Father
 and I will love him and will manifest Myself to him.\u201d","Judas (not Iscariot) said unto Him
 \u201cLord
 how is it that Thou wilt manifest Thyself unto us
 and not unto the world?\u201d","Jesus answered and said unto him
 \u201cIf a man love Me
 he will keep My words; and My Father will love him
 and We will come unto him and make Our abode with him.","He that loveth Me not
 keepeth not My sayings. And the Word which you hear is not Mine
 but the Father\u2019s who sent Me.","\u201cThese things have I spoken unto you
 being yet present with you.","But the Comforter
 who is the Holy Ghost whom the Father will send in My name
 He shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance
 whatsoever I have said unto you.","\u201cPeace I leave with you; My peace I give unto you
 not as the world giveth
 give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled
 neither let it be afraid.","Ye have heard how I said unto you
 \u2018I go away and come again unto you.\u2019 If ye loved Me
 ye would rejoice because I said
 \u2018I go unto the Father
\u2019 for My Father is greater than I.","And now I have told you before it come to pass
 that when it is come to pass
 ye might believe.","\u201cHereafter I will not talk much with you
 for the prince of this world cometh
 and hath nothing in Me.","But that the world may know that I love the Father
 as the Father gave Me commandment
 even so I do. Arise
 let us go hence.","\u201cI am the true vine
 and My Father is the husbandman.","Every branch in Me that beareth not fruit He taketh away; and every branch that beareth fruit
 He purgeth it
 that it may bring forth more fruit.","Now ye are clean through the Word which I have spoken unto you.","\u201cAbide in Me
 and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself
 unless it abide in the vine
 no more can ye
 unless ye abide in Me.","\u201cI am the vine
 ye are the branches. He that abideth in Me and I in Him
 the same bringeth forth much fruit
 for without Me ye can do nothing.","If a man abide not in Me
 he is cast forth as a branch and is withered; and men gather them and cast them into the fire
 and they are burned.","If ye abide in Me
 and My words abide in you
 ye shall ask what ye will
 and it shall be done unto you.","Herein is My Father glorified
 that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be My disciples.","\u201cAs the Father hath loved Me
 so have I loved you. Continue ye in My love.","If ye keep My commandments
 ye shall abide in My love
 even as I have kept My Father\u2019s commandments
 and abide in His love.","These things have I spoken unto you
 that My joy might remain in you
 and that your joy might be full.","\u201cThis is My commandment: that ye love one another
 as I have loved you.","Greater love hath no man than this
 that a man lay down his life for his friends.","Ye are My friends if ye do whatsoever I command you.","Henceforth I call you not servants
 for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth; but I have called you friends
 for all things that I have heard of My Father
 I have made known unto you.","Ye have not chosen Me
 but I have chosen you and ordained you
 that ye should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain
 that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in My name
 He may give it to you.","These things I command you
 that ye love one another.","\u201cIf the world hate you
 ye know that it hated Me before it hated you.","If ye were of the world
 the world would love his own; but because ye are not of the world
 but I have chosen you out of the world
 therefore the world hateth you.","Remember the word that I said unto you: \u2018The servant is not greater than his lord.\u2019 If they have persecuted Me
 they will also persecute you; if they have kept My saying
 they will keep yours also.","But all these things will they do unto you for My name\u2019s sake
 because they know not Him that sent Me.","If I had not come and spoken unto them
 they would not have sin
 but now they have no cloak for their sin.","He that hateth Me hateth My Father also.","If I had not done among them the works which no other man did
 they would not have had sin; but now they have both seen and hated both Me and My Father.","But this cometh to pass
 that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law: \u2018They hated Me without a cause.\u2019","\u201cBut when the Comforter is come
 whom I will send unto you from the Father
 even the Spirit of Truth who proceedeth from the Father
 He shall testify of Me.","And ye also shall bear witness
 because ye have been with Me from the beginning.","\u201cThese things have I spoken unto you
 that ye should not lose faith.","They shall put you out of the synagogues; yea
 the time cometh that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.","And these things will they do unto you
 because they have not known the Father
 nor Me.","But these things have I told you
 that when the time shall come
 ye may remember that I told you of them. \u201cAnd these things I said not unto you at the beginning
 because I was with you.","But now I go My way to Him that sent Me
 and none of you asketh Me
 \u2018Whither goest Thou?\u2019","But because I have said these things unto you
 sorrow hath filled your heart.","Nevertheless I tell you the truth. It is expedient for you that I go away
 for if I go not away
 the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart
 I will send Him unto you.","And when He is come
 He will reprove the world concerning sin
 and concerning righteousness
 and concerning judgment:","concerning sin
 because they believe not in Me;","concerning righteousness
 because I go to My Father and ye see Me no more;","concerning judgment
 because the prince of this world is judged.","\u201cI have yet many things to say unto you
 but ye cannot bear them now.","However when He
 the Spirit of Truth
 is come
 He will guide you into all truth; for He shall not speak from Himself
 but whatsoever He shall hear
 that shall He speak; and He will show you things to come.","He shall glorify Me
 for He shall receive of Mine
 and shall show it unto you.","All things that the Father hath are Mine; therefore I said that He shall take of Mine
 and shall show it unto you.","A little while
 and ye shall not see Me; and again a little while
 and ye shall see Me
 because I go to the Father.\u201d","Then said some of His disciples among themselves
 \u201cWhat is this that He saith unto us
 \u2018A little while
 and ye shall not see Me; and again a little while
 and ye shall see Me
\u2019 and
 \u2018because I go to the Father\u2019?\u201d","They said therefore
 \u201cWhat is this that He saith
 \u2018A little while\u2019? We cannot tell what He saith.\u201d","Now Jesus knew that they were desirous of asking Him
 and said unto them
 \u201cDo ye inquire among yourselves of what I said
 \u2018A little while
 and ye shall not see Me; and again a little while
 and ye shall see Me\u2019?","Verily
 verily I say unto you that ye shall weep and lament
 but the world shall rejoice; and ye shall be sorrowful
 but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.","A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow
 because her hour is come; but as soon as she is delivered of the child
 she remembereth no more the anguish
 for the joy that a man is born into the world.","And ye now therefore have sorrow; but I will see you again
 and your heart shall rejoice
 and your joy no man taketh from you.","And in that day ye shall ask Me nothing. Verily
 verily I say unto you
 whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in My name
 He will give it to you.","Hitherto have ye asked nothing in My name. Ask and ye shall receive
 that your joy may be full.","\u201cThese things have I spoken unto you in proverbs; but the time cometh when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs
 but I shall show you plainly of the Father.","In that day ye shall ask in My name
 and I say not unto you that I will pray the Father for you;","for the Father Himself loveth you
 because ye have loved Me and have believed that I came out from God.","I came forth from the Father
 and am come into the world. Again
 I leave the world and go to the Father.\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cDo ye now believe?","Behold
 the hour cometh
 yea
 is now come
 that ye shall be scattered
 every man to his own
 and shall leave Me alone. And yet I am not alone
 because the Father is with Me.","These things I have spoken unto you
 that in Me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation
 but be of good cheer: I have overcome the world.\u201d","These words spoke Jesus and lifted up His eyes to Heaven and said
 \u201cFather
 the hour is come. Glorify Thy Son
 that Thy Son also may glorify Thee
","as Thou hast given Him power over all flesh
 that He should give eternal life to as many as Thou hast given Him.","And this is life eternal: that they might know Thee
 the only true God
 and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent.","I have glorified Thee on the earth; I have finished the work which Thou gavest Me to do.","And now
 O Father
 glorify Thou Me with Thine own Self with the glory which I had with Thee before the world was.","\u201cI have manifested Thy name unto the men whom Thou gavest Me out of the world. Thine they were
 and Thou gavest them to Me
 and they have kept Thy Word.","Now they have known that all things whatsoever Thou hast given Me are of Thee.","For I have given unto them the Words which Thou gavest Me; and they have received them and have known surely that I came out from Thee
 and they have believed that Thou didst send Me.","I pray for them; I pray not for the world
 but for them whom Thou hast given Me
 for they are Thine.","And all Mine are Thine
 and Thine are Mine
 and I am glorified in them.","And now I am no more in the world
 but these are in the world
 and I come to Thee. Holy Father
 keep through Thine own name those whom Thou hast given Me
 that they may be one
 as We are.","While I was with them in the world
 I kept them in Thy name. Those that Thou gavest Me I have kept
 and none of them is lost
 but the son of perdition
 that the Scripture might be fulfilled.","\u201cAnd now come I to Thee
 and these things I speak in the world
 that they might have My joy fulfilled in themselves.","I have given them Thy Word
 and the world hath hated them
 because they are not of the world
 even as I am not of the world.","I pray not that Thou shouldest take them out of the world
 but that Thou shouldest keep them from the evil.","They are not of the world
 even as I am not of the world.","Sanctify them through Thy truth: Thy Word is truth.","As Thou hast sent Me into the world
 even so have I also sent them into the world.","And for their sakes I sanctify Myself
 that they also might be sanctified through the truth.","\u201cNeither pray I for these alone
 but for them also who shall believe in Me through their word
","that they all may be one
 as Thou
 Father
 art in Me and I in Thee
 that they also may be one in Us
 that the world may believe that Thou hast sent Me.","And the glory which Thou gavest Me I have given them
 that they may be one
 even as We are one:","I in them and Thou in Me
 that they may be made perfect in one
 and that the world may know that Thou hast sent Me and hast loved them
 as Thou hast loved Me.","\u201cFather
 I will that they also
 whom Thou hast given Me
 be with Me where I am
 that they may behold My glory which Thou hast given Me; for Thou loved Me before the foundation of the world.","\u201cO righteous Father
 the world hath not known Thee
 but I have known Thee
 and these have known that Thou hast sent Me.","And I have declared unto them Thy name
 and will declare it
 that the love wherewith Thou hast loved Me may be in them
 and I in them.\u201d","Jesus therefore
 knowing all things that should come upon Him
 went forth and said unto them
 \u201cWhom seek ye?\u201d","They answered Him
 \u201cJesus of Nazareth.\u201d Jesus said unto them
 \u201cI am He.\u201d And Judas also
 who betrayed Him
 stood with them.","As soon then as He had said unto them
 \u201cI am He
\u201d they went backward and fell to the ground.","Then asked He them again
 \u201cWhom seek ye?\u201d And they said
 \u201cJesus of Nazareth.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cI have told you that I am He. If therefore ye seek Me
 let these go their way
\u201d","Then said Jesus unto Peter
 \u201cPut up thy sword into the sheath. The cup which My Father hath given Me
 shall I not drink it?\u201d","Then the damsel who kept the door said unto Peter
 \u201cArt not thou also one of this man\u2019s disciples?\u201d He said
 \u201cI am not.\u201d","Jesus answered him
 \u201cI spoke openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue and in the temple whither the Jews always resort
 and in secret have I said nothing.","Why askest thou Me? Ask them that heard Me what I have said unto them. Behold
 they know what I said.\u201d","Jesus answered him
 \u201cIf I have spoken evil
 bear witness of the evil; but if well
 why smitest thou Me?\u201d","Then said Pilate unto them
 \u201cTake ye him and judge him according to your law.\u201d The Jews therefore said unto him
 \u201cIt is not lawful for us to put any man to death
\u201d","Jesus answered him
 \u201cSayest thou this thing of thyself
 or did others tell it thee of Me?\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cMy Kingdom is not of this world. If My Kingdom were of this world
 then would My servants fight
 that I should not be delivered to the Jews. But now is My Kingdom not from hence.\u201d","Pilate therefore said unto Him
 \u201cArt thou a king then?\u201d Jesus answered
 \u201cThou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born
 and for this cause came I into the world
 that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth My voice.\u201d","Pilate therefore went forth again and said unto them
 \u201cBehold
 I bring him forth to you
 that ye may know that I find no fault in him.\u201d","Then came Jesus forth
 wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. And Pilate said unto them
 \u201cBehold the man!\u201d","When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw Him

 saying
 \u201cCrucify him! Crucify him!\u201d Pilate said unto them
 \u201cYe take him and crucify him

 \u201cThou couldest have no power at all against Me
 unless it were given thee from above. Therefore he that delivered Me unto thee hath the greater sin.\u201d","And it was the Preparation of the Passover and about the sixth hour
 and Pilate said unto the Jews
 \u201cBehold your king!\u201d","When Jesus therefore saw His mother and the disciple standing by whom He loved
 He said unto His mother
 \u201cWoman
 behold thy son!\u201d","Then said He to the disciple
 \u201cBehold thy mother!\u201d And from that hour
 that disciple took her unto his own home.","After this Jesus
 knowing that all things were now accomplished
 that the Scripture might be fulfilled
 said
 \u201cI thirst.\u201d","When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar
 He said
 \u201cIt is finished.\u201d And He bowed His head and gave up the ghost.","Then she ran and came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple

 \u201cWoman
 why weepest thou?\u201d She said unto them
 \u201cBecause they have taken away my Lord

 \u201cWoman
 why weepest thou? Whom seekest thou?\u201d She
 supposing Him to be the gardener
 said unto Him
 \u201cSir
 if thou have borne Him hence
 tell me where thou hast laid Him
 and I will take Him away.\u201d","Jesus said unto her
 \u201cMary!\u201d She turned herself and said unto Him
 \u201cRabboni!\u201d (which is to say
 \u201cMaster\u201d).","Jesus said unto her
 \u201cTouch Me not
 for I am not yet ascended to My Father; but go to My brethren and say unto them
 \u2018I ascend unto My Father and your Father
 and to My God and your God.\u2019\u201d","Then the same day at evening
 being the first day of the week
 when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews
 came Jesus and stood in their midst and said unto them
 \u201cPeace be unto you.\u201d","Then said Jesus to them again
 \u201cPeace be unto you. As My Father hath sent Me
 even so send I you.\u201d","And when He had said this
 He breathed on them and said unto them
 \u201cReceive ye the Holy Ghost.","Whosoever sins ye remit
 they are remitted unto them; and whosoever sins ye retain
 they are retained.\u201d","The other disciples therefore said unto him
 \u201cWe have seen the Lord.\u201d But he said unto them
 \u201cUnless I shall see in His hands the print of the nails

 and thrust my hand into His side
 I will not believe.\u201d","And after eight days the disciples were again within
 and Thomas was with them. Then came Jesus
 the doors being shut

 \u201cPeace be unto you.\u201d","Then said He to Thomas
 \u201cReach hither thy finger and behold My hands
 and reach hither thy hand and thrust it into My side: and be not faithless
 but believing.\u201d","Jesus said unto him
 \u201cThomas
 because thou hast seen Me
 thou hast believed. Blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believed.\u201d","Then Jesus said unto them
 \u201cChildren
 have ye any meat?\u201d And they answered Him
 \u201cNo.\u201d","Jesus said unto them
 \u201cBring of the fish which ye have now caught.\u201d","Jesus said unto them
 \u201cCome and dine.\u201d And none of the disciples dared ask Him

 \u201cFeed My sheep.\u201d","He said unto him the third time
 \u201cSimon
 son of Jonah
 lovest thou Me?\u201d Peter was grieved because He said unto him the third time
 \u201cLovest thou Me?\u201d And he said unto Him
 \u201cLord
 Thou knowest all things. Thou knowest that I love Thee.\u201d Jesus said unto him
 \u201cFeed My sheep.","Verily
 verily I say unto thee
 when thou wast young
 thou girded thyself and walked whither thou wouldest; but when thou shalt be old
 thou shalt stretch forth thy hands

 signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when He had spoken this

 \u201cFollow Me.\u201d","Jesus said unto him
 \u201cIf I will that he tarry till I come
 what is that to thee? Follow thou Me.\u201d","Then this saying went abroad among the brethren
 that that disciple should not die. Yet Jesus had not said unto him

 What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith
 I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered
 No.","Then said they unto him
 Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?","He said
 I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness

 and saw them following

 Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt
 and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.","And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him

 I say unto thee
 Except a man be born again
 he cannot see the kingdom of God.","Jesus answered
 Verily
 verily
 I say unto thee
 Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit
 he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.","That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.","Marvel not that I said unto thee
 Ye must be born again.","The wind bloweth where it listeth
 and thou hearest the sound thereof
 but canst not tell whence it cometh
 and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.","Jesus answered and said unto him
 Art thou a master of Israel
 and knowest not these things?","Verily
 verily
 I say unto thee
 We speak that we do know
 and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.","If I have told you earthly things
 and ye believe not
 how shall ye believe
 if I tell you of heavenly things?","And no man hath ascended up to heaven
 but he that came down from heaven
 even the Son of man which is in heaven.","And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness
 even so must the Son of man be lifted up:","That whosoever believeth in him should not perish
 but have eternal life.","For God so loved the world
 that he gave his only begotten Son
 that whosoever believeth in him should not perish
 but have everlasting life.","For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.","He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already
 because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.","And this is the condemnation
 that light is come into the world
 and men loved darkness rather than light
 because their deeds were evil.","For every one that doeth evil hateth the light
 neither cometh to the light
 lest his deeds should be reproved.","But he that doeth truth cometh to the light
 that his deeds may be made manifest
 that they are wrought in God.","And they came unto John
 and said unto him
 Rabbi
 he that was with thee beyond Jordan
 to whom thou barest witness
 behold
 the same baptizeth
 and all men come to him.","There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her
 Give me to drink.","Jesus answered and said unto her
 If thou knewest the gift of God
 and who it is that saith to thee
 Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him
 and he would have given thee living water.","Jesus answered and said unto her
 Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:","But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.","The woman saith unto him
 Sir
 give me this water
 that I thirst not
 neither come hither to draw.","Jesus saith unto her
 Go
 call thy husband
 and come hither.","The woman answered and said
 I have no husband. Jesus said unto her
 Thou hast well said
 I have no husband:","For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.","Jesus saith unto her
 Woman
 believe me
 the hour cometh
 when ye shall neither in this mountain
 nor yet at Jerusalem
 worship the Father.","Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.","But the hour cometh
 and now is
 when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.","God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.","Jesus saith unto her
 I that speak unto thee am he.","But he said unto them
 I have meat to eat that ye know not of.","Jesus saith unto them
 My meat is to do the will of him that sent me
 and to finish his work.","Say not ye
 There are yet four months
 and then cometh harvest? behold
 I say unto you
 Lift up your eyes
 and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.","And he that reapeth receiveth wages
 and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.","And herein is that saying true
 One soweth
 and another reapeth.","I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured
 and ye are entered into their labours.","And said unto the woman
 Now we believe
 not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves
 and know that this is indeed the Christ
 the Saviour of the world.","Then said Jesus unto him
 Except ye see signs and wonders
 ye will not believe.","Jesus saith unto him
 Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him
 and he went his way.","Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him
 Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.","So the father knew that it was at the same hour
 in the which Jesus said unto him
 Thy son liveth: and himself believed
 and his whole house.","When Jesus saw him lie
 and knew that he had been now a long time in that case
 he saith unto him
 Wilt thou be made whole?","Jesus saith unto him
 Rise
 take up thy bed
 and walk.","He answered them
 He that made me whole
 the same said unto me
 Take up thy bed
 and walk.","Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple
 and said unto him
 Behold
 thou art made whole: sin no more
 lest a worse thing come unto thee.","But Jesus answered them
 My Father worketh hitherto
 and I work.","Then answered Jesus and said unto them
 Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 The Son can do nothing of himself
 but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth
 these also doeth the Son likewise.","For the Father loveth the Son
 and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these
 that ye may marvel.","For as the Father raiseth up the dead
 and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.","For the Father judgeth no man
 but hath committed all judgment unto the Son:","That all men should honour the Son
 even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him.","Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 He that heareth my word
 and believeth on him that sent me
 hath everlasting life
 and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.","Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 The hour is coming
 and now is
 when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.","For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;","And hath given him authority to execute judgment also
 because he is the Son of man.","Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming
 in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice
","And shall come forth; they that have done good
 unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil
 unto the resurrection of damnation.","I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear
 I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will
 but the will of the Father which hath sent me.","If I bear witness of myself
 my witness is not true.","There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.","Ye sent unto John
 and he bare witness unto the truth.","But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say
 that ye might be saved.","He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.","But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish
 the same works that I do
 bear witness of me
 that the Father hath sent me.","And the Father himself
 which hath sent me
 hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time
 nor seen his shape.","And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent
 him ye believe not.","Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.","And ye will not come to me
 that ye might have life.","I receive not honour from men.","But I know you
 that ye have not the love of God in you.","I am come in my Father's name
 and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name
 him ye will receive.","How can ye believe
 which receive honour one of another
 and seek not the honour that cometh from God only?","Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you
 even Moses
 in whom ye trust.","For had ye believed Moses
 ye would have believed me; for he wrote of me.","But if ye believe not his writings
 how shall ye believe my words?","When Jesus then lifted up his eyes
 and saw a great company come unto him
 he saith unto Philip
 Whence shall we buy bread
 that these may eat?","And Jesus said
 Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down
 in number about five thousand.","When they were filled
 he said unto his disciples
 Gather up the fragments that remain
 that nothing be lost.","But he saith unto them
 It is I; be not afraid.","Jesus answered them and said
 Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 Ye seek me
 not because ye saw the miracles
 but because ye did eat of the loaves
 and were filled.","Labour not for the meat which perisheth
 but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life
 which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed.","Jesus answered and said unto them
 This is the work of God
 that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.","Then Jesus said unto them
 Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven.","For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven
 and giveth life unto the world.","And Jesus said unto them
 I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.","But I said unto you
 That ye also have seen me
 and believe not.","All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.","For I came down from heaven
 not to do mine own will
 but the will of him that sent me.","And this is the Father's will which hath sent me
 that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing
 but should raise it up again at the last day.","And this is the will of him that sent me
 that every one which seeth the Son
 and believeth on him
 may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.","Jesus therefore answered and said unto them
 Murmur not among yourselves.","No man can come to me
 except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.","It is written in the prophets
 And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard
 and hath learned of the Father
 cometh unto me.","Not that any man hath seen the Father
 save he which is of God
 he hath seen the Father.","Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.","I am that bread of life.","Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness
 and are dead.","This is the bread which cometh down from heaven
 that a man may eat thereof
 and not die.","I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread
 he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh
 which I will give for the life of the world.","Then Jesus said unto them
 Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man
 and drink his blood
 ye have no life in you.","Whoso eateth my flesh
 and drinketh my blood
 hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.","For my flesh is meat indeed
 and my blood is drink indeed.","He that eateth my flesh
 and drinketh my blood
 dwelleth in me
 and I in him.","As the living Father hath sent me
 and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me
 even he shall live by me.","This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna
 and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever.","When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it
 he said unto them
 Doth this offend you?","What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?","It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you
 they are spirit
 and they are life.","But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not
 and who should betray him.","And he said
 Therefore said I unto you
 that no man can come unto me
 except it were given unto him of my Father.","Then said Jesus unto the twelve
 Will ye also go away?","Jesus answered them
 Have not I chosen you twelve
 and one of you is a devil?","His brethren therefore said unto him
 Depart hence
 and go into Judaea
 that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.","Then Jesus said unto them
 My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready.","The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth
 because I testify of it
 that the works thereof are evil.","Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast: for my time is not yet full come.","Jesus answered them
 and said
 My doctrine is not mine
 but his that sent me.","If any man will do his will
 he shall know of the doctrine
 whether it be of God
 or whether I speak of myself.","He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him
 the same is true
 and no unrighteousness is in him.","Did not Moses give you the law
 and yet none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me?","Jesus answered and said unto them
 I have done one work
 and ye all marvel.","Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses
 but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man.","If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision
 that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me
 because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?","Judge not according to the appearance
 but judge righteous judgment.","Then said some of them of Jerusalem
 Is not this he
 whom they seek to kill?","Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught
 saying
 Ye both know me
 and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself
 but he that sent me is true
 whom ye know not.","But I know him: for I am from him
 and he hath sent me.","Then said Jesus unto them
 Yet a little while am I with you
 and then I go unto him that sent me.","Ye shall seek me
 and shall not find me: and where I am
 thither ye cannot come.","Then said the Jews among themselves
 Whither will he go
 that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles
 and teach the Gentiles?","In the last day
 that great day of the feast
 Jesus stood and cried
 saying
 If any man thirst
 let him come unto me
 and drink.","He that believeth on me
 as the scripture hath said
 out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.","(But this spake he of the Spirit
 which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)","They say unto him
 Master
 this woman was taken in adultery
 in the very act.","So when they continued asking him
 he lifted up himself
 and said unto them
 He that is without sin among you
 let him first cast a stone at her.","When Jesus had lifted up himself
 and saw none but the woman
 he said unto her
 Woman
 where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?","She said
 No man
 Lord. And Jesus said unto her
 Neither do I condemn thee: go
 and sin no more.","Then spake Jesus again unto them
 saying
 I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness
 but shall have the light of life.","Jesus answered and said unto them
 Though I bear record of myself
 yet my record is true: for I know whence I came
 and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come
 and whither I go.","Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.","And yet if I judge
 my judgment is true: for I am not alone
 but I and the Father that sent me.","It is also written in your law
 that the testimony of two men is true.","I am one that bear witness of myself
 and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.","Then said they unto him
 Where is thy Father? Jesus answered
 Ye neither know me
 nor my Father: if ye had known me
 ye should have known my Father also.","Then said Jesus again unto them
 I go my way
 and ye shall seek me
 and shall die in your sins: whither I go
 ye cannot come.","And he said unto them
 Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.","I said therefore unto you
 that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he
 ye shall die in your sins.","Then said they unto him
 Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them
 Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning.","I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.","Then said Jesus unto them
 When ye have lifted up the Son of man
 then shall ye know that I am he
 and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me
 I speak these things.","And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.","Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him
 If ye continue in my word
 then are ye my disciples indeed;","And ye shall know the truth
 and the truth shall make you free.","Jesus answered them
 Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.","And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son abideth ever.","If the Son therefore shall make you free
 ye shall be free indeed.","I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me
 because my word hath no place in you.","I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.","They answered and said unto him
 Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them
 If ye were Abraham's children
 ye would do the works of Abraham.","But now ye seek to kill me
 a man that hath told you the truth
 which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.","Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him
 We be not born of fornication; we have one Father
 even God.","Jesus said unto them
 If God were your Father
 ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself
 but he sent me.","Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word.","Ye are of your father the devil
 and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning
 and abode not in the truth
 because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie
 he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar
 and the father of it.","And because I tell you the truth
 ye believe me not.","Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth
 why do ye not believe me?","He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear them not
 because ye are not of God.","Jesus answered
 I have not a devil; but I honour my Father
 and ye do dishonour me.","And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.","Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 If a man keep my saying
 he shall never see death.","Then said the Jews unto him
 Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead
 and the prophets; and thou sayest
 If a man keep my saying
 he shall never taste of death.","Jesus answered
 If I honour myself
 my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say
 that he is your God:","Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say
 I know him not
 I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him
 and keep his saying.","Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it
 and was glad.","Jesus said unto them
 Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 Before Abraham was
 I am.","Jesus answered
 Neither hath this man sinned
 nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.","I must work the works of him that sent me
 while it is day: the night cometh
 when no man can work.","As long as I am in the world
 I am the light of the world.","And said unto him
 Go
 wash in the pool of Siloam
 (which is by interpretation
 Sent.) He went his way therefore
 and washed
 and came seeing.","He answered and said
 A man that is called Jesus made clay
 and anointed mine eyes
 and said unto me
 Go to the pool of Siloam
 and wash: and I went and washed
 and I received sight.","Then said they unto him
 Where is he? He said
 I know not.","Then again called they the man that was blind
 and said unto him
 Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.","He answered and said
 Whether he be a sinner or no
 I know not: one thing I know
 that
 whereas I was blind
 now I see.","Then said they to him again
 What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?","He answered them
 I have told you already
 and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples?","Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him
 he said unto him
 Dost thou believe on the Son of God?","And Jesus said unto him
 Thou hast both seen him
 and it is he that talketh with thee.","And Jesus said
 For judgment I am come into this world
 that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.","Jesus said unto them
 If ye were blind
 ye should have no sin: but now ye say
 We see; therefore your sin remaineth.","Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold
 but climbeth up some other way
 the same is a thief and a robber.","But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.","To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name
 and leadeth them out.","And when he putteth forth his own sheep
 he goeth before them
 and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.","And a stranger will they not follow
 but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.","Then said Jesus unto them again
 Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 I am the door of the sheep.","All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.","I am the door: by me if any man enter in
 he shall be saved
 and shall go in and out
 and find pasture.","The thief cometh not
 but for to steal
 and to kill
 and to destroy: I am come that they might have life
 and that they might have it more abundantly.","I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.","But he that is an hireling
 and not the shepherd
 whose own the sheep are not
 seeth the wolf coming
 and leaveth the sheep
 and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them
 and scattereth the sheep.","The hireling fleeth
 because he is an hireling
 and careth not for the sheep.","I am the good shepherd
 and know my sheep
 and am known of mine.","As the Father knoweth me
 even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.","And other sheep I have
 which are not of this fold: them also I must bring
 and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold
 and one shepherd.","Therefore doth my Father love me
 because I lay down my life
 that I might take it again.","No man taketh it from me
 but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down
 and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.","Jesus answered them
 I told you
 and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father's name
 they bear witness of me.","But ye believe not
 because ye are not of my sheep
 as I said unto you.","My sheep hear my voice
 and I know them
 and they follow me:","And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish
 neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.","My Father
 which gave them me
 is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.","I and my Father are one.","Jesus answered them
 Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?","Jesus answered them
 Is it not written in your law
 I said
 Ye are gods?","If he called them gods
 unto whom the word of God came
 and the scripture cannot be broken;","Say ye of him
 whom the Father hath sanctified
 and sent into the world
 Thou blasphemest; because I said
 I am the Son of God?","If I do not the works of my Father
 believe me not.","But if I do
 though ye believe not me
 believe the works: that ye may know
 and believe
 that the Father is in me
 and I in him.","When Jesus heard that
 he said
 This sickness is not unto death
 but for the glory of God
 that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.","Then after that saith he to his disciples
 Let us go into Judaea again.","Jesus answered
 Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day
 he stumbleth not
 because he seeth the light of this world.","But if a man walk in the night
 he stumbleth
 because there is no light in him.","These things said he: and after that he saith unto them
 Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go
 that I may awake him out of sleep.","Then said Jesus unto them plainly
 Lazarus is dead.","And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there
 to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.","Then said Thomas
 which is called Didymus
 unto his fellowdisciples
 Let us also go
 that we may die with him.","Jesus saith unto her
 Thy brother shall rise again.","Jesus said unto her
 I am the resurrection
 and the life: he that believeth in me
 though he were dead
 yet shall he live:","And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?","She saith unto him
 Yea
 Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ
 the Son of God
 which should come into the world.","Then when Mary was come where Jesus was
 and saw him
 she fell down at his feet
 saying unto him
 Lord
 if thou hadst been here
 my brother had not died.","And said
 Where have ye laid him? They said unto him
 Lord
 come and see.","Jesus said
 Take ye away the stone. Martha
 the sister of him that was dead
 saith unto him
 Lord
 by this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead four days.","Jesus saith unto her
 Said I not unto thee
 that
 if thou wouldest believe
 thou shouldest see the glory of God?","Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes
 and said
 Father
 I thank thee that thou hast heard me.","And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it
 that they may believe that thou hast sent me.","And when he thus had spoken
 he cried with a loud voice
 Lazarus
 come forth.","And he that was dead came forth
 bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them
 Loose him
 and let him go.","Then said Jesus
 Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this.","For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.","The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave
 and raised him from the dead
 bare record.","The Pharisees therefore said among themselves
 Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold
 the world is gone after him.","The same came therefore to Philip
 which was of Bethsaida of Galilee
 and desired him
 saying
 Sir
 we would see Jesus.","And Jesus answered them
 saying
 The hour is come
 that the Son of man should be glorified.","Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die
 it abideth alone: but if it die
 it bringeth forth much fruit.","He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.","If any man serve me
 let him follow me; and where I am
 there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me
 him will my Father honour.","Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father
 save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.","Father
 glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven
 saying
 I have both glorified it
 and will glorify it again.","Jesus answered and said
 This voice came not because of me
 but for your sakes.","Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.","And I
 if I be lifted up from the earth
 will draw all men unto me.","Then Jesus said unto them
 Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light
 lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.","While ye have light
 believe in the light
 that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus
 and departed
 and did hide himself from them.","Jesus cried and said
 He that believeth on me
 believeth not on me
 but on him that sent me.","And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.","I am come a light into the world
 that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness.","And if any man hear my words
 and believe not
 I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world
 but to save the world.","He that rejecteth me
 and receiveth not my words
 hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken
 the same shall judge him in the last day.","For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me
 he gave me a commandment
 what I should say
 and what I should speak.","And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore
 even as the Father said unto me
 so I speak.","Jesus answered and said unto him
 What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter.","Peter saith unto him
 Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him
 If I wash thee not
 thou hast no part with me.","Jesus saith to him
 He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet
 but is clean every whit: and ye are clean
 but not all.","For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he
 Ye are not all clean.","So after he had washed their feet
 and had taken his garments
 and was set down again
 he said unto them
 Know ye what I have done to you?","Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.","If I then
 your Lord and Master
 have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet.","For I have given you an example
 that ye should do as I have done to you.","Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him.","If ye know these things
 happy are ye if ye do them.","I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled
 He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me.","Now I tell you before it come
 that
 when it is come to pass
 ye may believe that I am he.","Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.","When Jesus had thus said
 he was troubled in spirit
 and testified
 and said
 Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 that one of you shall betray me.","Jesus answered
 He it is
 to whom I shall give a sop
 when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop
 he gave it to Judas Iscariot
 the son of Simon.","And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him
 That thou doest
 do quickly.","Therefore
 when he was gone out
 Jesus said
 Now is the Son of man glorified
 and God is glorified in him.","If God be glorified in him
 God shall also glorify him in himself
 and shall straightway glorify him.","Little children
 yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews
 Whither I go
 ye cannot come; so now I say to you.","A new commandment I give unto you
 That ye love one another; as I have loved you
 that ye also love one another.","By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples
 if ye have love one to another.","Simon Peter said unto him
 Lord
 whither goest thou? Jesus answered him
 Whither I go
 thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards.","Jesus answered him
 Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily
 verily
 I say unto thee
 The cock shall not crow
 till thou hast denied me thrice.","Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God
 believe also in me.","In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so
 I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.","And if I go and prepare a place for you
 I will come again
 and receive you unto myself; that where I am
 there ye may be also.","And whither I go ye know
 and the way ye know.","Jesus saith unto him
 I am the way
 the truth
 and the life: no man cometh unto the Father
 but by me.","If ye had known me
 ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him
 and have seen him.","Jesus saith unto him
 Have I been so long time with you
 and yet hast thou not known me
 Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then
 Show us the Father?","Believest thou not that I am in the Father
 and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me
 he doeth the works.","Believe me that I am in the Father
 and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works' sake.","Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 He that believeth on me
 the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.","And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name
 that will I do
 that the Father may be glorified in the Son.","If ye shall ask any thing in my name
 I will do it.","If ye love me
 keep my commandments.","And I will pray the Father
 and he shall give you another Comforter
 that he may abide with you for ever;","Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive
 because it seeth him not
 neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you
 and shall be in you.","I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.","Yet a little while
 and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live
 ye shall live also.","At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father
 and ye in me
 and I in you.","He that hath my commandments
 and keepeth them
 he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father
 and I will love him
 and will manifest myself to him.","Judas saith unto him
 not Iscariot
 Lord
 how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us
 and not unto the world?","Jesus answered and said unto him
 If a man love me
 he will keep my words: and my Father will love him
 and we will come unto him
 and make our abode with him.","He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine
 but the Father's which sent me.","These things have I spoken unto you
 being yet present with you.","But the Comforter
 which is the Holy Ghost
 whom the Father will send in my name
 he shall teach you all things
 and bring all things to your remembrance
 whatsoever I have said unto you.","Peace I leave with you
 my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth
 give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled
 neither let it be afraid.","Ye have heard how I said unto you
 I go away
 and come again unto you. If ye loved me
 ye would rejoice
 because I said
 I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I.","And now I have told you before it come to pass
 that
 when it is come to pass
 ye might believe.","Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh
 and hath nothing in me.","But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment
 even so I do. Arise
 let us go hence.","I am the true vine
 and my Father is the husbandman.","Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit
 he purgeth it
 that it may bring forth more fruit.","Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.","Abide in me
 and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself
 except it abide in the vine; no more can ye
 except ye abide in me.","I am the vine
 ye are the branches: He that abideth in me
 and I in him
 the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.","If a man abide not in me
 he is cast forth as a branch
 and is withered; and men gather them
 and cast them into the fire
 and they are burned.","If ye abide in me
 and my words abide in you
 ye shall ask what ye will
 and it shall be done unto you.","Herein is my Father glorified
 that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.","As the Father hath loved me
 so have I loved you: continue ye in my love.","If ye keep my commandments
 ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments
 and abide in his love.","These things have I spoken unto you
 that my joy might remain in you
 and that your joy might be full.","This is my commandment
 That ye love one another
 as I have loved you.","Greater love hath no man than this
 that a man lay down his life for his friends.","Ye are my friends
 if ye do whatsoever I command you.","Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.","Ye have not chosen me
 but I have chosen you
 and ordained you
 that ye should go and bring forth fruit
 and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name
 he may give it you.","These things I command you
 that ye love one another.","If the world hate you
 ye know that it hated me before it hated you.","If ye were of the world
 the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world
 but I have chosen you out of the world
 therefore the world hateth you.","Remember the word that I said unto you
 The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me
 they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying
 they will keep yours also.","But all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake
 because they know not him that sent me.","If I had not come and spoken unto them
 they had not had sin: but now they have no cloak for their sin.","He that hateth me hateth my Father also.","If I had not done among them the works which none other man did
 they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.","But this cometh to pass
 that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law
 They hated me without a cause.","But when the Comforter is come
 whom I will send unto you from the Father
 even the Spirit of truth
 which proceedeth from the Father
 he shall testify of me:","And ye also shall bear witness
 because ye have been with me from the beginning.","These things have I spoken unto you
 that ye should not be offended.","They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea
 the time cometh
 that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.","And these things will they do unto you
 because they have not known the Father
 nor me.","But these things have I told you
 that when the time shall come
 ye may remember that I told you of them. And these things I said not unto you at the beginning
 because I was with you.","But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me
 Whither goest thou?","But because I have said these things unto you
 sorrow hath filled your heart.","Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away
 the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart
 I will send him unto you.","And when he is come
 he will reprove the world of sin
 and of righteousness
 and of judgment:","Of sin
 because they believe not on me;","Of righteousness
 because I go to my Father
 and ye see me no more;","Of judgment
 because the prince of this world is judged.","I have yet many things to say unto you
 but ye cannot bear them now.","Howbeit when he
 the Spirit of truth
 is come
 he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear
 that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.","He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine
 and shall shew it unto you.","All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I
 that he shall take of mine
 and shall shew it unto you.","A little while
 and ye shall not see me: and again
 a little while
 and ye shall see me
 because I go to the Father.","Then said some of his disciples among themselves
 What is this that he saith unto us
 A little while
 and ye shall not see me: and again
 a little while
 and ye shall see me: and
 Because I go to the Father?","They said therefore
 What is this that he saith
 A little while? we cannot tell what he saith.","Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him
 and said unto them
 Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said
 A little while
 and ye shall not see me: and again
 a little while
 and ye shall see me?","Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 That ye shall weep and lament
 but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful
 but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.","A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow
 because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child
 she remembereth no more the anguish
 for joy that a man is born into the world.","And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again
 and your heart shall rejoice
 and your joy no man taketh from you.","And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily
 verily
 I say unto you
 Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name
 he will give it you.","Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask
 and ye shall receive
 that your joy may be full.","These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time cometh
 when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs
 but I shall shew you plainly of the Father.","At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you
 that I will pray the Father for you:","For the Father himself loveth you
 because ye have loved me
 and have believed that I came out from God.","I came forth from the Father
 and am come into the world: again
 I leave the world
 and go to the Father.","Jesus answered them
 Do ye now believe?","Behold
 the hour cometh
 yea
 is now come
 that ye shall be scattered
 every man to his own
 and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone
 because the Father is with me.","These things I have spoken unto you
 that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.","These words spake Jesus
 and lifted up his eyes to heaven
 and said
 Father
 the hour is come; glorify thy Son
 that thy Son also may glorify thee:","As thou hast given him power over all flesh
 that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.","And this is life eternal
 that they might know thee the only true God
 and Jesus Christ
 whom thou hast sent.","I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.","And now
 O Father
 glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.","I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were
 and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thy word.","Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee.","For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received them
 and have known surely that I came out from thee
 and they have believed that thou didst send me.","I pray for them: I pray not for the world
 but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine.","And all mine are thine
 and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them.","And now I am no more in the world
 but these are in the world
 and I come to thee. Holy Father
 keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me
 that they may be one
 as we are.","While I was with them in the world
 I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept
 and none of them is lost
 but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.","And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world
 that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.","I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them
 because they are not of the world
 even as I am not of the world.","I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world
 but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.","They are not of the world
 even as I am not of the world.","Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.","As thou hast sent me into the world
 even so have I also sent them into the world.","And for their sakes I sanctify myself
 that they also might be sanctified through the truth.","Neither pray I for these alone
 but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;","That they all may be one; as thou
 Father
 art in me
 and I in thee
 that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.","And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one
 even as we are one:","I in them
 and thou in me
 that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me
 and hast loved them
 as thou hast loved me.","Father
 I will that they also
 whom thou hast given me
 be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory
 which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.","O righteous Father
 the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee
 and these have known that thou hast sent me.","And I have declared unto them thy name
 and will declare it: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them
 and I in them.","Jesus therefore
 knowing all things that should come upon him
 went forth
 and said unto them
 Whom seek ye?","They answered him
 Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them
 I am he. And Judas also
 which betrayed him
 stood with them.","As soon then as he had said unto them
 I am he
 they went backward
 and fell to the ground.","Then asked he them again
 Whom seek ye? And they said
 Jesus of Nazareth.","Jesus answered
 I have told you that I am he: if therefore ye seek me
 let these go their way:","Then said Jesus unto Peter
 Put up thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me
 shall I not drink it?","Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter
 Art not thou also one of this man's disciples? He saith
 I am not.","Jesus answered him
 I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue
 and in the temple
 whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing.","Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me
 what I have said unto them: behold
 they know what I said.","Jesus answered him
 If I have spoken evil
 bear witness of the evil: but if well
 why smitest thou me?","Then said Pilate unto them
 Take ye him
 and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him
 It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:","Jesus answered him
 Sayest thou this thing of thyself
 or did others tell it thee of me?","Jesus answered
 My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world
 then would my servants fight
 that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.","Pilate therefore said unto him
 Art thou a king then? Jesus answered
 Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born
 and for this cause came I into the world
 that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.","Pilate therefore went forth again
 and saith unto them
 Behold
 I bring him forth to you
 that ye may know that I find no fault in him.","Then came Jesus forth
 wearing the crown of thorns
 and the purple robe. And Pilate saith unto them
 Behold the man!","When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him
 they cried out
 saying
 Crucify him
 crucify him. Pilate saith unto them
 Take ye him
 and crucify him: for I find no fault in him.","Jesus answered
 Thou couldest have no power at all against me
 except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin.","And it was the preparation of the passover
 and about the sixth hour: and he saith unto the Jews
 Behold your King!","When Jesus therefore saw his mother
 and the disciple standing by
 whom he loved
 he saith unto his mother
 Woman
 behold thy son!","Then saith he to the disciple
 Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home.","After this
 Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished
 that the scripture might be fulfilled
 saith
 I thirst.","When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar
 he said
 It is finished: and he bowed his head
 and gave up the ghost.","Then she runneth
 and cometh to Simon Peter
 and to the other disciple
 whom Jesus loved
 and saith unto them
 They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre
 and we know not where they have laid him.","And they say unto her
 Woman
 why weepest thou? She saith unto them
 Because they have taken away my Lord
 and I know not where they have laid him.","Jesus saith unto her
 Woman
 why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She
 supposing him to be the gardener
 saith unto him
 Sir
 if thou have borne him hence
 tell me where thou hast laid him
 and I will take him away.","Jesus saith unto her
 Mary. She turned herself
 and saith unto him
 Rabboni; which is to say
 Master.","Jesus saith unto her
 Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren
 and say unto them
 I ascend unto my Father
 and your Father; and to my God
 and your God.","Then the same day at evening
 being the first day of the week
 when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews
 came Jesus and stood in the midst
 and saith unto them
 Peace be unto you.","Then said Jesus to them again
 Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me
 even so send I you.","And when he had said this
 he breathed on them
 and saith unto them
 Receive ye the Holy Ghost:","Whose soever sins ye remit
 they are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain
 they are retained.","The other disciples therefore said unto him
 We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them
 Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails
 and put my finger into the print of the nails
 and thrust my hand into his side
 I will not believe.","And after eight days again his disciples were within
 and Thomas with them: then came Jesus
 the doors being shut
 and stood in the midst
 and said
 Peace be unto you.","Then saith he to Thomas
 Reach hither thy finger
 and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand
 and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless
 but believing.","Jesus saith unto him
 Thomas
 because thou hast seen me
 thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen
 and yet have believed.","Then Jesus saith unto them
 Children
 have ye any meat? They answered him
 No.","Jesus saith unto them
 Bring of the fish which ye have now caught.","Jesus saith unto them
 Come and dine. And none of the disciples durst ask him
 Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.","So when they had dined
 Jesus saith to Simon Peter
 Simon
 son of Jonas
 lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him
 Yea
 Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him
 Feed my lambs.","He saith to him again the second time
 Simon
 son of Jonas
 lovest thou me? He saith unto him
 Yea
 Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him
 Feed my sheep.","He saith unto him the third time
 Simon
 son of Jonas
 lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time
 Lovest thou me? And he said unto him
 Lord
 thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him
 Feed my sheep.","Verily
 verily
 I say unto thee
 When thou wast young
 thou girdest thyself
 and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old
 thou shalt stretch forth thy hands
 and another shall gird thee
 and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.","This spake he
 signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this
 he saith unto him
 Follow me.","Jesus saith unto him
 If I will that he tarry till I come
 what is that to thee? follow thou me.","Then went this saying abroad among the brethren
 that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him
 He shall not die; but
 If I will that he tarry till I come
 what is that to thee?","And they asked him
 \u201cThen who are you? Are you Elijah?\u201d And he said
 \u201cI am not!\u201d \u201cAre you the Prophet?\u201d And he answered
 \u201cNo!\u201d ","Then they said to him
 \u201cWho are you
 so that we can give an answer to those who sent us? What do you say about yourself?\u201d","He said
 \u201cI am \u2018the voice of one crying out in the wilderness
 \u201cMake straight the way of the Lord
\u201d\u2019 just as Isaiah the prophet said.\u201d ","And Jesus
 turning around and seeing them following him
 said to them
 \u201cWhat do you seek?\u201d And they said to him
 \u201cRabbi\u201d (which means when translated \u201cTeacher\u201d)
 \u201cwhere are you staying?\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cCome and you will see!\u201d So they came and saw where he was staying
 and they stayed with him that day (it was about the tenth hour).","He brought him to Jesus. Looking at him
 Jesus said
 \u201cYou are Simon the son of John. You will be called Cephas\u201d (which is interpreted \u201cPeter\u201d).","On the next day he wanted to depart for Galilee
 and he found Philip. And Jesus said to him
 \u201cFollow me!\u201d ","Philip found Nathanael and said to him
 \u201cWe have found the one whom Moses wrote about in the law
 and the prophets wrote about\u2014Jesus son of Joseph from Nazareth!\u201d ","And Nathanael said to him
 \u201cCan anything good come out of Nazareth?\u201d Philip said to him
 \u201cCome and see!\u201d","Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and said about him
 \u201cLook! A true Israelite in whom is no deceit!\u201d ","Nathanael said to him
 \u201cFrom where do you know me?\u201d Jesus answered and said to him
 \u201cBefore Philip called you
 when you were under the fig tree
 I saw you.\u201d ","Jesus answered and said to him
 \u201cBecause I said to you that I saw you under the fig tree
 do you believe? You will see greater things than these!\u201d ","And he said to him
 \u201cTruly
 truly I say to all of you
 you will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.\u201d","And Jesus said to her
 \u201cWhat does your concern have to do with me
 woman? My hour has not yet come.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cFill the water jars with water.\u201d And they filled them to the brim. ","And he said to them
 \u201cNow draw some out and take it to the head steward. So they took it. ","And to the ones selling the doves he said
 \u201cTake these things away from here! Do not make my Father\u2019s house a marketplace!\u201d ","Jesus answered and said to them
 \u201cDestroy this temple
 and in three days I will raise it up!\u201d ","Jesus answered and said to him
 \u201cTruly
 truly I say to you
 unless someone is born from above
 he is not able to see the kingdom of God.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cTruly
 truly I say to you
 unless someone is born of water and spirit
 he is not able to enter into the kingdom of God. ","What is born of the flesh is flesh
 and what is born of the Spirit is spirit. ","Do not be astonished that I said to you
 \u2018It is necessary for you to be born from above.\u2019 ","The wind blows wherever it wishes
 and you hear the sound of it
 but you do not know where it comes from and where it is going. So is everyone who is born of the Spirit.\u201d","Jesus answered and said to him
 \u201cAre you the teacher of Israel
 and you do not understand these things? ","Truly
 truly I say to you
 we speak what we know
 and we testify about what we have seen
 and you do not accept our testimony! ","If I tell you earthly things and you do not believe
 how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things? ","And no one has ascended into heaven except the one who descended from heaven\u2014the Son of Man.","And just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness
 thus it is necessary that the Son of Man be lifted up
 ","so that everyone who believes in him will have eternal life.\u201d","For in this way God loved the world
 so that he gave his one and only Son
 in order that everyone who believes in him will not perish
 but will have eternal life. ","For God did not send his Son into the world in order that he should judge the world
 but in order that the world should be saved through him. ","The one who believes in him is not judged
 but the one who does not believe has already been judged
 because he has not believed in the name of the one and only Son of God. ","And this is the judgment: that the light has come into the world
 and people loved the darkness rather than the light
 because their deeds were evil. ","For everyone who practices evil hates the light and does not come to the light
 lest his deeds be exposed. ","But the one who practices the truth comes to the light
 in order that his deeds may be revealed
 that they are done in God.","And they came to John and said to him
 \u201cRabbi
 he who was with you on the other side of the Jordan
 about whom you testified\u2014look
 this one is baptizing
 and all are coming to him!\u201d","A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her
 \u201cGive me water to drink.\u201d ","Jesus answered and said to her
 \u201cIf you had known the gift of God and who it is who says to you
 \u2018Give me water to drink
\u2019 you would have asked him
 and he would have given you living water.\u201d ","Jesus answered and said to her
 \u201cEveryone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again. ","But whoever drinks of this water which I will give to him will never be thirsty for eternity
 but the water which I will give to him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life.\u201d ","The woman said to him
 \u201cSir
 give me this water
 so that I will not be thirsty or come here to draw water!\u201d ","He said to her
 \u201cGo
 call your husband and come here.\u201d ","The woman answered and said to him
 \u201cI do not have a husband.\u201d Jesus said to her
 \u201cYou have said rightly
 \u2018I do not have a husband
\u2019 ","for you have had five husbands
 and the one whom you have now is not your husband; this you have said truthfully!\u201d","Jesus said to her
 \u201cBelieve me
 woman
 that an hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father. ","You worship what you do not know. We worship what we know
 because salvation is from the Jews. ","But an hour is coming\u2014and now is here\u2014when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth
 for indeed the Father seeks such people to be his worshipers. ","God is spirit
 and the ones who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.\u201d ","Jesus said to her
 \u201cI
 the one speaking to you
 am he.","But he said to them
 \u201cI have food to eat that you do not know about.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cMy food is that I do the will of the one who sent me and complete his work. ","Do you not say
 \u2018There are yet four months and the harvest comes\u2019? Behold
 I say to you
 lift up your eyes and look at the fields
 that they are white for harvest already. ","The one who reaps receives wages and gathers fruit for eternal life
 in order that the one who sows and the one who reaps can rejoice together. ","For in this instance the saying is true
 \u2018It is one who sows and another who reaps.\u2019 ","I sent you to reap what you did not work for; others have worked
 and you have entered into their work.\u201d","And they were saying to the woman
 \u201cNo longer because of what you said do we believe
 for we ourselves have heard
 and we know that this one is truly the Savior of the world!\u201d","So Jesus said to him
 \u201cUnless you people see signs and wonders
 you will never believe!\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cGo
 your son will live.\u201d The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him
 and he departed.","So he inquired from them the hour at which he had gotten better. Then they said to him
 \u201cYesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.\u201d ","So the father knew that it was that same hour at which Jesus said to him
 \u201cYour son will live
\u201d and he himself believed
 and his whole household. ","Jesus
 when he saw this one lying there and knew that he had been sick a long time already
 said to him
 \u201cDo you want to become well?\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cGet up! Pick up your mat and walk!\u201d ","But he answered them
 \u201cThe one who made me well\u2014that one said to me
 \u2018Pick up your mat and walk!\u2019\u201d ","After these things Jesus found him at the temple and said to him
 \u201cLook
 you have become well! Sin no longer
 lest something worse happen to you.\u201d ","But he answered them
 \u201cMy Father is working until now
 and I am working.\u201d ","So Jesus answered and said to them
 \u201cTruly
 truly I say to you
 the Son can do nothing from himself except what he sees the Father doing. For whatever that one does
 these things also the Son does likewise. ","For the Father loves the Son and shows him everything that he himself is doing. And greater works than these he will show him
 so that you will be astonished. ","For just as the Father raises the dead and makes them alive
 thus also the Son makes alive whomever he wishes. ","For the Father does not judge anyone
 but he has given all judgment to the Son
 ","in order that all people will honor the Son
 just as they honor the Father. The one who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him. ","Truly
 truly I say to you that the one who hears my word and who believes the one who sent me has eternal life
 and does not come into judgment
 but has passed from death into life.","\u201cTruly
 truly I say to you
 that an hour is coming\u2014and now is here\u2014when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God
 and the ones who hear will live. ","For just as the Father has life in himself
 thus also he has granted to the Son to have life in himself. ","And he has granted him authority to carry out judgment
 because he is the Son of Man.","\u201cDo not be astonished at this
 because an hour is coming in which all those in the tombs will hear his voice ","and they will come out\u2014those who have done good things to a resurrection of life
 but those who have practiced evil things to a resurrection of judgment. ","I am able to do nothing from myself. Just as I hear
 I judge
 and my judgment is just
 because I do not seek my own will
 but the will of the one who sent me.","\u201cIf I testify about myself
 my testimony is not true. ","There is another who testifies about me
 and I know that the testimony which he testifies about me is true. ","You have sent to John and he has testified to the truth.","(And I do not receive testimony from people
 but I say these things in order that you may be saved.) ","That one was the lamp which was burning and shining
 and you wanted to rejoice for an hour in his light.","\u201cBut I have a testimony greater than John\u2019s
 for the works which the Father has given to me that I should complete them\u2014the very works which I am doing\u2014these testify about me
 that the Father has sent me. ","And the Father who sent me
 that one has testified about me. You have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his form. ","And you do not have his word residing in yourselves
 because the one whom that one sent
 in this one you do not believe. ","You search the scriptures because you think that you have eternal life in them
 and it is these that testify about me. ","And you are not willing to come to me so that you may have life.","\u201cI do not accept glory from people
 ","but I know you
 that you do not have the love of God in yourselves. ","I have come in my Father\u2019s name
 and you do not accept me. If another should come in his own name
 you would accept that one! ","How are you able to believe
 if you accept glory from one another
 and do not seek the glory which is from the only God? ","Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father! The one who accuses you is Moses
 in whom you have put your hope! ","For if you had believed Moses
 you would believe me
 for that one wrote about me. ","But if you do not believe that one\u2019s writings
 how will you believe my words?\u201d","Then Jesus
 when he looked up  and saw that a large crowd was coming to him
 said to Philip
 \u201cWhere can we buy bread so that these people can eat?\u201d ","Jesus said
 \u201cMake the people recline.\u201d (Now there was a lot of grass in the place.) So the men reclined
 approximately five thousand in number. ","And when they were satisfied
 he said to his disciples
 \u201cGather the remaining fragments so that nothing is lost.\u201d ","But he said to them
 \u201cIt is I! Do not be afraid!\u201d ","Jesus replied to them and said
 \u201cTruly
 truly I say to you
 you seek me not because you saw signs
 but because you ate of the loaves and were satisfied! ","Do not work for the food that perishes
 but the food that remains to eternal life
 which the Son of Man will give to you. For God the Father has set his seal on this one.\u201d","Jesus answered and said to them
 \u201cThis is the work of God: that you believe in the one whom that one sent.\u201d ","Then Jesus said to them
 \u201cTruly
 truly I say to you
 Moses did not give you bread from heaven
 but my Father is giving you the true bread from heaven! ","For the bread of God is the one who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cI am the bread of life. The one who comes to me will never be hungry
 and the one who believes in me will never be thirsty again. ","But I said to you that you have seen me and do not believe.","Everyone whom the Father gives to me will come to me
 and the one who comes to me I will never throw out
 ","because I have come down from heaven not that I should do my will
 but the will of the one who sent me. ","Now this is the will of the one who sent me: that everyone whom he has given me
 I would not lose any of them
 but raise them up on the last day. ","For this is the will of my Father
 that everyone who looks at the Son and believes in him would have eternal life
 and I will raise him up on the last day.\u201d","Jesus answered and said to them
 \u201cDo not grumble among yourselves! ","No one is able to come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him
 and I will raise him up on the last day. ","It is written in the prophets
 \u2018And they will all be taught by God.\u2019 Everyone who hears from the Father and learns comes to me. ","(Not that anyone has seen the Father except the one who is from God\u2014this one has seen the Father.)","Truly
 truly I say to you
 the one who believes has eternal life. ","I am the bread of life.","Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness and they died.","This is the bread that comes down from heaven so that someone may eat from it and not die.","I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats from this bread
 he will live forever. And the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.\u201d","Then Jesus said to them
 \u201cTruly
 truly I say to you
 unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood
 you do not have life in yourselves! ","The one who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life
 and I will raise him up on the last day. ","For my flesh is true food
 and my blood is true drink. ","The one who eats my flesh and drinks my blood resides in me and I in him.","Just as the living Father sent me
 and I live because of the Father
 so also the one who eats me\u2014that one will live because of me. ","This is the bread that came down from heaven
 not as the fathers ate and died. The one who eats this bread will live forever.\u201d","But Jesus
 because he knew within himself that his disciples were grumbling about this
 said to them
 \u201cDoes this cause you to be offended? ","Then what if you see the Son of Man ascending where he was before?","The Spirit is the one who gives life; the flesh profits nothing. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.","But there are some of you who do not believe.\u201d (For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe
 and who it was who would betray him.) ","And he said
 \u201cBecause of this I said to you that no one can come to me unless it has been granted to him by the Father.\u201d","So Jesus said to the twelve
 \u201cYou do not want to go away also
 do you?\u201d ","Jesus replied to them
 \u201cDid I not choose you
 the twelve
 and one of you is the devil?\u201d ","So his brothers said to him
 \u201cDepart from here and go to Judea
 so that your disciples also can see your works that you are doing. ","So Jesus said to them
 \u201cMy time has not yet come
 but your time is always ready. ","The world cannot hate you
 but it hates me
 because I am testifying about it
 that its deeds are evil. ","You go up to the feast. I am not going up to this feast
 because my time is not yet completed. ","So Jesus answered them and said
 \u201cMy teaching is not mine
 but is from the one who sent me. ","If anyone wants to do his will
 he will know about my teaching
 whether it is from God or I am speaking from myself. ","The one who speaks from himself seeks his own glory. But the one who seeks the glory of the one who sent him\u2014this one is true
 and there is no unrighteousness in him. ","Has not Moses given you the law
 and none of you carries out the law? Why do you seek to kill me?\u201d","Jesus answered and said to them
 \u201cI performed one work
 and you are all astonished. ","Because of this Moses has given you circumcision (not that it is from Moses
 but from the fathers)
 and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath. ","If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses would not be broken
 are you angry with me because I made a whole man well on the Sabbath? ","Do not judge according to outward appearance
 but judge according to righteous judgment!\u201d","Then some of the inhabitants of Jerusalem began to say
 \u201cIs this not the one whom they are seeking to kill? ","Then Jesus cried out in the temple courts
 teaching and saying
 \u201cYou both know me and you know where I am from! And I have not come from myself
 but the one who sent me is true
 whom you do not know. ","I know him
 because I am from him and he sent me.\u201d","Then Jesus said
 \u201cYet a little time I am with you
 and I am going to the one who sent me. ","You will seek me and will not find me
 and where I am
 you cannot come.\u201d","So the Jews said to one another
 \u201cWhere is this one going to go
 that we will not find him? He is not going to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks
 is he? ","Now on the last day of the feast\u2014the great day\u2014Jesus stood and cried out
 saying
 \u201cIf anyone is thirsty
 let him come to me
 and let him drink
 ","the one who believes in me. Just as the scripture said
 \u2018Out of his belly will flow rivers of living water.\u2019\u201d ","Now he said this concerning the Spirit
 whom those who believed in him were about to receive. For the Spirit was not yet given
 because Jesus had not yet been glorified.)","they said to him
 testing him
 \u201cTeacher
 this woman was caught in the very act of committing adultery! ","And when they persisted in asking him
 straightening up he said to them
 \u201cThe one of you without sin
 let him throw the first stone at her!\u201d ","So Jesus
 straightening up and seeing no one except the woman
 said to her
 \u201cWhere are those accusers of yours? Does no one condemn you?\u201d ","And she said
 \u201cNo one
 Lord.\u201d So Jesus said
 \u201cNeither do I condemn you. Go
 and sin no more.\u201d]]","Then Jesus spoke to them again
 saying
 \u201cI am the light of the world! The one who follows me will never walk in darkness
 but will have the light of life.\u201d ","Jesus answered and said to them
 \u201cEven if I testify concerning myself
 my testimony is true
 because I know where I have come from and where I am going. But you do not know where I have come from or where I am going. ","You judge according to externals; I do not judge anyone.","But even if I judge
 my judgment is true
 because I am not alone
 but I and the Father who sent me. ","And even in your law it is written that the testimony of two men is true.","I am the one who testifies concerning myself
 and the Father who sent me testifies concerning me.\u201d","So they were saying to him
 \u201cWhere is your father?\u201d Jesus replied
 \u201cYou know neither me nor my Father! If you had known me
 you would have known my Father also.\u201d ","So he said to them again
 \u201cI am going away
 and you will seek me and will die in your sin. Where I am going you cannot come!\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cYou are from below; I am from above. You are from this world; I am not from this world. ","Thus I said to you that you will die in your sins. For if you do not believe that I am he
 you will die in your sins.\u201d","So they began to say to him
 \u201cWho are you?\u201d Jesus said to them
 \u201cWhat I have been saying to you from the beginning. ","I have many things to say and to judge concerning you
 but the one who sent me is true
 and the things which I heard from him
 these things I say to the world.\u201d ","Then Jesus said
 \u201cWhen you lift up the Son of Man
 then you will recognize that I am he
 and I do nothing from myself

 I say these things. ","And the one who sent me is with me. He has not left me alone
 because I always do the things that are pleasing to him.\u201d ","Then Jesus said to those Jews who had believed him
 \u201cIf you continue in my word you are truly my disciples
 ","and you will know the truth
 and the truth will set you free.\u201d ","Jesus replied to them
 \u201cTruly
 truly I say to you
 that everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin. ","And the slave does not remain in the household forever; the son remains forever.","So if the son sets you free
 you will be truly free. ","I know that you are descendants of Abraham. But you are seeking to kill me
 because my word makes no progress among you. ","I speak the things that I have seen with the Father; so also you do the things that you have heard from the Father.\u201d","They answered and said to him
 \u201cAbraham is our father!\u201d Jesus said to them
 \u201cIf you are children of Abraham
 do the deeds of Abraham! ","But now you are seeking to kill me
 a man who spoke to you the truth which I heard from God. This Abraham did not do. ","You are doing the deeds of your father!\u201d They said to him
 \u201cWe were not born from sexual immorality! We have one father
 God!\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cIf God were your father
 you would love me
 for I have come forth from God and have come. For I have not come from myself
 but that one sent me. ","Why do you not understand my way of speaking? Because you are not able to listen to my message.","You are of your father the devil
 and you want to do the desires of your father! That one was a murderer from the beginning
 and does not stand firm in the truth
 because truth is not in him. Whenever he speaks the lie
 he speaks from his own nature
 because he is a liar and the father of lies. ","But because I am telling the truth
 you do not believe me. ","Who among you convicts me concerning sin? If I am telling the truth
 why do you not believe me? ","The one who is from God listens to the words of God. Because of this you do not listen\u2014because you are not of God.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cI do not have a demon
 but I honor my Father
 and you dishonor me! ","But I do not seek my own glory. There is one who seeks and judges!","Truly
 truly I say to you
 if anyone keeps my word
 he will never experience death forever.\u201d","The Jews said to him
 \u201cNow we know that you have a demon! Abraham and the prophets died
 and you say
 \u2018If anyone keeps my word
 he will never taste death forever.\u2019 ","Jesus replied
 \u201cIf I glorify myself
 my glory is nothing. The one who glorifies me is my Father
 about whom you say
 \u2018He is our God.\u2019 ","And you have not known him
 but I know him. And if I were to say that I do not know him
 I would be a liar like you! But I know him and I keep his word. ","Abraham your father rejoiced that he would see my day
 and he saw it and was glad.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cTruly
 truly I say to you
 before Abraham was
 I am!\u201d ","Jesus replied
 \u201cNeither this man sinned nor his parents
 but it happened so that the works of God could be revealed in him. ","It is necessary for us to do the deeds of the one who sent me while it is day; night is coming
 when no one can work! ","While I am in the world
 I am the light of the world.\u201d ","And he said to him
 \u201cGo
 wash in the pool of Siloam\u201d (which is translated \u201csent\u201d). So he went and washed and came back seeing.","He replied
 \u201cThe man who is called Jesus made clay and smeared it on my eyes and said to me
 \u2018Go to Siloam and wash!\u2019 So I went
 and I washed
 and I received sight.\u201d ","And they said to him
 \u201cWhere is that man?\u201d He said
 \u201cI do not know.\u201d","So they summoned the man who had been blind for the second time and said to him
 \u201cGive glory to God! We know that this man is a sinner!\u201d ","Then that man replied
 \u201cWhether he is a sinner I do not know. One thing I know\u2014that although I was blind
 now I see!\u201d ","So they said to him
 \u201cWhat did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?\u201d ","He replied to them
 \u201cI told you already and you did not listen! Why do you want to hear it again? You do not want to become his disciples also

 and finding him
 he said
 \u201cDo you believe in the Son of Man?\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cYou have both seen him
 and he is the one who is speaking with you.\u201d ","And Jesus said
]] \u201cFor judgment I have come into this world

 and those who see may become blind!\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cIf you were blind
 you would not have sin. But now you say
 \u2018We see
\u2019 your sin remains.","\u201cTruly
 truly I say to you
 the one who does not enter through the door into the fold of the sheep
 but climbs up at some other place\u2014that one is a thief and a robber. ","But the one who enters through the door is the shepherd of the sheep.","For this one the doorkeeper opens
 and the sheep hear his voice
 and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. ","Whenever he sends out all his own
 he goes before them
 and the sheep follow him because they know his voice. ","And they will never follow a stranger
 but will flee from him
 because they do not know the voice of strangers.\u201d ","Then Jesus said to them again
 \u201cTruly
 truly
 I say to you
 I am the door of the sheep. ","All those who came before me are thieves and robbers
 but the sheep do not listen to them. ","I am the door. If anyone enters through me
 he will be saved
 and will come in and will go out and will find pasture. ","The thief comes only so that he can steal and kill and destroy; I have come so that they may have life
 and have it abundantly.","\u201cI am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.","The hired hand
 who is not the shepherd
 whose own the sheep are not
 sees the wolf approaching and abandons the sheep and runs away\u2014and the wolf seizes them and scatters them\u2014","because he is a hired hand and he is not concerned about the sheep.","\u201cI am the good shepherd
 and I know my own
 and my own know me
 ","just as the Father knows me and I know the Father

 and they will hear my voice
 and they will become one flock\u2014one shepherd. ","Because of this the Father loves me
 because I lay down my life so that I may take possession of it again. ","No one takes it from me
 but I lay it down voluntarily. I have authority to lay it down
 and I have authority to take possession of it again. This commandment I received from my Father.\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cI told you and you do not believe! The deeds that I do in the name of my Father
 these testify about me. ","But you do not believe

 do not believe me. ","But if I am doing them

 Jesus said
 \u201cThis sickness is not to death
 but for the glory of God

 \u201cLet us go to Judea again.\u201d ","Jesus replied
 Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks around in the daylight
 he does not stumble

 he stumbles

 \u201cOur friend Lazarus has fallen asleep

 \u201cLazarus has died
 ","and I am glad for your sake that I was not there

 \u201cDid I not say to you that if you believed
 you would see the glory of God?\u201d ","So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes above and said
 \u201cFather
 I give thanks to you that you hear me. ","And I know that you always hear me

 he cried out with a loud voice
 \u201cLazarus

 \u201cUntie him and let him go.\u201d","So Jesus said
 \u201cLeave her alone

 \u201cThe hour has come that the Son of Man will be glorified. ","Truly
 truly I say to you

 \u201cYou will never wash my feet forever!\u201d Jesus replied to him
 \u201cUnless I wash you
 you do not have a share with me.\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cThe one who has bathed only needs to wash his feet
 but is completely clean. And you are clean
 but not all of you.\u201d ","(For he knew the one who would betray him; because of this he said
 \u201cNot all of you are clean.\u201d)","So when he had washed their feet and taken his outer clothing and reclined at table again
 he said to them
 \u201cDo you understand what I have done for you? ","You call me \u2018Teacher\u2019 and \u2018Lord
\u2019 and you speak correctly
 for I am. ","If then I\u2014your Lord and Teacher\u2014wash your feet
 you also ought to wash one another\u2019s feet. ","For I have given you an example
 that just as I have done for you
 you also do. ","Truly
 truly I say to you
 a slave is not greater than his master
 nor a messenger greater than the one who sent him. ","If you understand these things
 you are blessed if you do them.","\u201cI am not speaking about all of you. I know whom I have chosen
 but in order that the scripture would be fulfilled
 \u2018The one who eats my bread has lifted up his heel against me.\u2019 ","From now on I am telling you before it happens
 in order that when it happens you may believe that I am he. ","Truly
 truly I say to you
 the one who receives anyone I send receives me
 and the one who receives me receives the one who sent me.\u201d","When he had said these things
 Jesus was troubled in spirit and testified and said
 \u201cTruly
 truly I say to you that one of you will betray me.\u201d ","Jesus replied
 \u201cIt is he to whom I dip the piece of bread and give it to him.\u201d Then after dipping the piece of bread
 he gave it to Judas son of Simon Iscariot. ","And after the piece of bread
 then Satan entered into him. Then Jesus said to him
 \u201cWhat you are doing
 do quickly!\u201d ","Then
 when he had gone out

 you may believe. ","I will no longer speak much with you

 he will convict the world concerning sin and concerning righteousness and concerning judgment: ","concerning sin

 truly I say to you
 that you will weep and lament
 but the world will rejoice; you will become sorrowful
 but your sorrow will change to joy. ","A woman
 when she gives birth
 experiences pain because her hour has come. But when her child is born
 she no longer remembers the affliction
 on account of the joy that a human being has been born into the world. ","So you also are experiencing sorrow now
 but I will see you again
 and your hearts will rejoice
 and no one will take away your joy from you. ","And on that day you will ask me nothing. Truly
 truly I say to you
 whatever you ask the Father in my name
 he will give you. ","Until now you have asked nothing in my name. Ask and you will receive
 so that your joy may be complete.","\u201cI have said these things to you in figurative sayings. An hour is coming when I will speak to you in figurative sayings no longer

 and I do not say to you that I will ask the Father on your behalf. ","For the Father himself loves you
 because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God. ","I have gone out from the Father and have come into the world; again
 I am leaving the world and am going to the Father.\u201d","Jesus replied to them
 \u201cNow do you believe? ","Behold
 an hour is coming\u2014and has come\u2014that you will be scattered each one to his own home

 but on behalf of those whom you have given me
 because they are yours
 ","and all my things are yours
 and your things are mine
 and I have been glorified in them. ","And I am no longer in the world
 and they are in the world
 and I am coming to you. Holy Father

 I kept them in your name

 just as I am not of the world. ","Sanctify them in the truth\u2014your word is truth.","Just as you sent me into the world
 I also have sent them into the world. ","And for them I sanctify myself
 so that they themselves also may be sanctified in the truth.","\u201cAnd I do not ask on behalf of these only
 but also on behalf of those who believe in me through their word
 ","that they all may be one
 just as you

 I have given to them

 because he knew all the things that were coming upon him
 went out and said to them
 \u201cWho are you looking for?\u201d ","They replied to him
 \u201cJesus the Nazarene.\u201d He said to them
 \u201cI am he.\u201d (Now Judas
 the one who betrayed him
 was also standing with them.) ","So when he said to them
 \u201cI am he
\u201d they drew back and fell to the ground. ","Then he asked them again
 \u201cWho are you looking for?\u201d And they said
 \u201cJesus the Nazarene.\u201d ","Jesus replied
 \u201cI said to you that I am he! So if you are looking for me
 let these men go
\u201d ","So Jesus said to Peter
 \u201cPut the sword into its sheath! The cup that the Father has given me\u2014shall I not drink it?\u201d","Then the female slave who was the doorkeeper said to Peter
 \u201cYou are not also one of the disciples of this man
 are you?\u201d He said
 \u201cI am not!\u201d ","Jesus replied to him
 \u201cI have spoken openly to the world. I always taught in the synagogue and in the temple courts where all the Jews assemble
 and I have said nothing in secret. ","Why are you asking me? Ask those who heard what I have said to them! Behold
 these people know what I said.\u201d ","Jesus replied to him
 \u201cIf I have spoken wrongly
 testify about what is wrong! But if I have spoken correctly
 why do you strike me?\u201d ","So Pilate said to them
 \u201cYou take him and judge him according to your law!\u201d The Jews said to him
 \u201cIt is not permitted for us to kill anyone
\u201d ","Jesus replied
 \u201cDo you say this from yourself
 or have others said this to you about me?\u201d ","Jesus replied
 \u201cMy kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world
 my servants would be fighting so that I would not be handed over to the Jews. But now my kingdom is not from here.\u201d ","Then Pilate said to him
 \u201cSo then you are a king!\u201d Jesus replied
 \u201cYou say that I am a king. For this reason I was born
 and for this reason I have come into the world: in order that I can testify to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears my voice.\u201d ","And Pilate came outside again and said to them
 \u201cBehold
 I am bringing him outside to you
 so that you will know that I find no basis for an accusation against him.\u201d ","Then Jesus came outside wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe
 and he said to them
 \u201cBehold the man!\u201d ","So when they saw him
 the chief priests and the officers shouted
 saying
 \u201cCrucify! Crucify!\u201d Pilate said to them
 \u201cYou take him and crucify him! For I do not find a basis for an accusation against him.\u201d ","Jesus replied to him
 \u201cYou would not have any authority over me unless it was given to you from above. For this reason the one who handed me over to you has greater sin.\u201d","(Now it was the day of preparation of the Passover; it was about the sixth hour.) And he said to the Jews
 \u201cBehold your king!\u201d","So Jesus
 seeing his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing there
 said to his mother
 \u201cWoman
 behold your son!\u201d ","Then he said to the disciple
 \u201cBehold your mother!\u201d And from that hour the disciple took her into his own home.","After this
 Jesus
 knowing that now at last everything was completed
 in order that the scripture would be fulfilled
 said
 \u201cI am thirsty.\u201d ","Then when he had received the sour wine
 Jesus said
 \u201cIt is completed
\u201d and bowing his head
 he gave up his spirit.","So she ran and came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved and said to them

 why are you weeping?\u201d She said to them

 \u201cWoman
 why are you weeping? Who are you looking for?\u201d She thought that it was the gardener

 \u201cSir
 if you have carried him away
 tell me where you have put him
 and I will take him.\u201d ","Jesus said to her
 \u201cMary.\u201d She turned around and said to him in Aramaic
 \u201cRabboni\u201d (which means \u201cTeacher\u201d). ","Jesus said to her
 \u201cDo not touch me

 \u2018I am ascending to my Father and your Father
 and my God and your God.\u2019\u201d ","Now when it was evening on that day\u2014the first day of the week\u2014and the doors had been shut where the disciples were because of fear of the Jews
 Jesus came and stood in their midst and said to them
 \u201cPeace to you.\u201d ","So Jesus said to them again
 \u201cPeace to you. As the Father has sent me
 I also send you.\u201d ","And when he had said this
 he breathed on them and said to them
 \u201cReceive the Holy Spirit. ","If you forgive the sins of any
 they are forgiven them. If you retain the sins of any
 they are retained.\u201d","So the other disciples said to him
 \u201cWe have seen the Lord!\u201d But he said to them
 \u201cUnless I see in his hands the mark of the nails

 and put my hand into his side
 I will never believe!\u201d","And after eight days his disciples were again inside
 and Thomas with them. Although the doors had been shut

 \u201cPeace to you.\u201d ","Then he said to Thomas
 \u201cPlace your finger here and see my hands
 and place your hand and put it into my side. And do not be unbelieving
 but believing!\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cBecause you have seen me
 have you believed? Blessed are those who have not seen and have believed.\u201d","So Jesus said to them
 \u201cChildren
 you do not have any fish to eat

 \u201cNo.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cBring some of the fish that you have just now caught.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cCome
 eat breakfast!\u201d But none of the disciples dared to ask him
 \u201cWho are you?\u201d because they knew that it was the Lord. ","Now when they had eaten breakfast
 Jesus said to Simon Peter
 \u201cSimon son of John
 do you love me more than these?\u201d He said to him
 \u201cYes

 you know that I love you.\u201d He said to him
 \u201cFeed my lambs!\u201d ","He said to him again a second time
 \u201cSimon son of John

 \u201cShepherd my sheep!\u201d ","He said to him a third time
 \u201cSimon son of John
 do you love me?\u201d Peter was distressed because he said to him a third time
 \u201cDo you love me?\u201d and he said to him
 \u201cLord
 you know everything! You know that I love you!\u201d Jesus said to him
 \u201cFeed my sheep! ","Truly
 truly I say to you
 when you were young
 you tied your clothes around yourself and walked wherever you wanted. But when you grow old
 you will stretch out your hands
 and someone else will tie you up and carry you where you do not want to go. ","(Now he said this to indicate by what kind of death he would glorify God.) And after he had said this
 he said to him
 \u201cFollow me!\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cIf I want him to remain until I come
 what is that to you? You follow me!\u201d ","So this saying went out to the brothers that that disciple would not die. But Jesus did not say to him that he would not die

 what is that to you?\u201d","So they asked him
 \u201cWhat are you then? Are you Elijah?\u201d And he said
 \u201cI am not.\u201d \u201cAre you the Prophet?\u201d He answered
 \u201cNo.\u201d ","So they said to him
 \u201cWho are you

 \u201cCome
 and you will see.\u201d So they went and saw where he was staying

 \u201cYou are Simon the son of John; you will be called Cephas\u201d (which is translated Peter).","The next day he decided to go to Galilee

 and stop making my Father\u2019s house a marketplace.\u201d ","Jesus answered and said to them
 \u201cDestroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up.\u201d ","Jesus answered and said to him
 \u201cAmen
 amen
 I say to you
 no one can see the kingdom of God without being born from above.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cAmen
 amen
 I say to you
 no one can enter the kingdom of God without being born of water and Spirit. ","What is born of flesh is flesh and what is born of spirit is spirit. ","Do not be amazed that I told you
 \u2018You must be born from above.\u2019 ","The wind blows where it wills
 and you can hear the sound it makes
 but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes; so it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.\u201d ","Jesus answered and said to him
 \u201cYou are the teacher of Israel and you do not understand this? ","Amen
 amen
 I say to you
 we speak of what we know and we testify to what we have seen
 but you people do not accept our testimony. ","If I tell you about earthly things and you do not believe
 how will you believe if I tell you about heavenly things? ","No one has gone up to heaven except the one who has come down from heaven
 the Son of Man. ","And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert
 so must the Son of Man be lifted up
 ","so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life.\u201d","For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son
 so that everyone who believes in him might not perish but might have eternal life. ","For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world
 but that the world might be saved through him. ","Whoever believes in him will not be condemned
 but whoever does not believe has already been condemned
 because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God. ","And this is the verdict
 that the light came into the world
 but people preferred darkness to light
 because their works were evil. ","For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come toward the light
 so that his works might not be exposed. ","But whoever lives the truth comes to the light
 so that his works may be clearly seen as done in God.","So they came to John and said to him
 \u201cRabbi
 the one who was with you across the Jordan
 to whom you testified
 here he is baptizing and everyone is coming to him.\u201d ","A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her
 \u201cGive me a drink.\u201d ","Jesus answered and said to her
 \u201cIf you knew the gift of God and who is saying to you
 \u2018Give me a drink
\u2019 you would have asked him and he would have given you living water.\u201d ","Jesus answered and said to her
 \u201cEveryone who drinks this water will be thirsty again; ","but whoever drinks the water I shall give will never thirst; the water I shall give will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life.\u201d ","The woman said to him
 \u201cSir
 give me this water
 so that I may not be thirsty or have to keep coming here to draw water.\u201d","Jesus said to her
 \u201cGo call your husband and come back.\u201d ","The woman answered and said to him
 \u201cI do not have a husband.\u201d Jesus answered her
 \u201cYou are right in saying
 \u2018I do not have a husband.\u2019 ","For you have had five husbands
 and the one you have now is not your husband. What you have said is true.\u201d ","Jesus said to her
 \u201cBelieve me
 woman
 the hour is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem. ","You people worship what you do not understand; we worship what we understand
 because salvation is from the Jews. ","But the hour is coming
 and is now here
 when true worshipers will worship the Father in Spirit and truth; and indeed the Father seeks such people to worship him. ","God is Spirit
 and those who worship him must worship in Spirit and truth.\u201d ","Jesus said to her
 \u201cI am he
 the one who is speaking with you.\u201d","But he said to them
 \u201cI have food to eat of which you do not know.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cMy food is to do the will of the one who sent me and to finish his work. ","Do you not say
 \u2018In four months the harvest will be here\u2019? I tell you
 look up and see the fields ripe for the harvest. ","The reaper is already receiving his payment and gathering crops for eternal life
 so that the sower and reaper can rejoice together. ","For here the saying is verified that \u2018One sows and another reaps.\u2019 ","I sent you to reap what you have not worked for; others have done the work
 and you are sharing the fruits of their work.\u201d","and they said to the woman
 \u201cWe no longer believe because of your word; for we have heard for ourselves
 and we know that this is truly the savior of the world.\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cUnless you people see signs and wonders
 you will not believe.\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cYou may go; your son will live.\u201d The man believed what Jesus said to him and left. ","He asked them when he began to recover. They told him
 \u201cThe fever left him yesterday
 about one in the afternoon.\u201d ","The father realized that just at that time Jesus had said to him
 \u201cYour son will live
\u201d and he and his whole household came to believe. ","When Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had been ill for a long time
 he said to him
 \u201cDo you want to be well?\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cRise
 take up your mat
 and walk.\u201d ","He answered them
 \u201cThe man who made me well told me
 \u2018Take up your mat and walk.\u2019\u201d ","After this Jesus found him in the temple area and said to him
 \u201cLook
 you are well; do not sin any more
 so that nothing worse may happen to you.\u201d ","But Jesus answered them
 \u201cMy Father is at work until now
 so I am at work.\u201d ","Jesus answered and said to them
 \u201cAmen
 amen
 I say to you
 a son cannot do anything on his own
 but only what he sees his father doing; for what he does
 his son will do also.","For the Father loves his Son and shows him everything that he himself does
 and he will show him greater works than these
 so that you may be amazed. ","For just as the Father raises the dead and gives life
 so also does the Son give life to whomever he wishes. ","Nor does the Father judge anyone
 but he has given all judgment to his Son
 ","so that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him. ","Amen
 amen
 I say to you
 whoever hears my word and believes in the one who sent me has eternal life and will not come to condemnation
 but has passed from death to life. ","Amen
 amen
 I say to you
 the hour is coming and is now here when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God
 and those who hear will live. ","For just as the Father has life in himself
 so also he gave to his Son the possession of life in himself. ","And he gave him power to exercise judgment
 because he is the Son of Man. ","Do not be amazed at this
 because the hour is coming in which all who are in the tombs will hear his voice ","and will come out
 those who have done good deeds to the resurrection of life
 but those who have done wicked deeds to the resurrection of condemnation.","\u201cI cannot do anything on my own; I judge as I hear
 and my judgment is just
 because I do not seek my own will but the will of the one who sent me.","\u201cIf I testify on my own behalf
 my testimony cannot be verified.","But there is another who testifies on my behalf
 and I know that the testimony he gives on my behalf is true. ","You sent emissaries to John
 and he testified to the truth. ","I do not accept testimony from a human being
 but I say this so that you may be saved. ","He was a burning and shining lamp
 and for a while you were content to rejoice in his light. ","But I have testimony greater than John\u2019s. The works that the Father gave me to accomplish
 these works that I perform testify on my behalf that the Father has sent me. ","Moreover
 the Father who sent me has testified on my behalf. But you have never heard his voice nor seen his form
 ","and you do not have his word remaining in you
 because you do not believe in the one whom he has sent. ","You search the scriptures
 because you think you have eternal life through them; even they testify on my behalf. ","But you do not want to come to me to have life.","\u201cI do not accept human praise;","moreover
 I know that you do not have the love of God in you. ","I came in the name of my Father
 but you do not accept me; yet if another comes in his own name
 you will accept him. ","How can you believe
 when you accept praise from one another and do not seek the praise that comes from the only God? ","Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father: the one who will accuse you is Moses
 in whom you have placed your hope. ","For if you had believed Moses
 you would have believed me
 because he wrote about me. ","But if you do not believe his writings
 how will you believe my words?\u201d","When Jesus raised his eyes and saw that a large crowd was coming to him
 he said to Philip
 \u201cWhere can we buy enough food for them to eat?\u201d ","Jesus said
 \u201cHave the people recline.\u201d Now there was a great deal of grass in that place. So the men reclined
 about five thousand in number. ","When they had had their fill
 he said to his disciples
 \u201cGather the fragments left over
 so that nothing will be wasted.\u201d ","But he said to them
 \u201cIt is I. Do not be afraid.\u201d ","Jesus answered them and said
 \u201cAmen
 amen
 I say to you
 you are looking for me not because you saw signs but because you ate the loaves and were filled. ","Do not work for food that perishes but for the food that endures for eternal life
 which the Son of Man will give you. For on him the Father
 God
 has set his seal.\u201d ","Jesus answered and said to them
 \u201cThis is the work of God
 that you believe in the one he sent.\u201d ","So Jesus said to them
 \u201cAmen
 amen
 I say to you
 it was not Moses who gave the bread from heaven; my Father gives you the true bread from heaven. ","For the bread of God is that which comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cI am the bread of life; whoever comes to me will never hunger
 and whoever believes in me will never thirst. ","But I told you that although you have seen 
 you do not believe. ","Everything that the Father gives me will come to me
 and I will not reject anyone who comes to me
 ","because I came down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of the one who sent me. ","And this is the will of the one who sent me
 that I should not lose anything of what he gave me
 but that I should raise it  the last day. ","For this is the will of my Father
 that everyone who sees the Son and believes in him may have eternal life
 and I shall raise him  the last day.\u201d","Jesus answered and said to them
 \u201cStop murmuring among yourselves. ","No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draw him
 and I will raise him on the last day. ","It is written in the prophets: \u2018They shall all be taught by God.\u2019 Everyone who listens to my Father and learns from him comes to me. ","Not that anyone has seen the Father except the one who is from God; he has seen the Father. ","Amen
 amen
 I say to you
 whoever believes has eternal life. ","I am the bread of life. ","Your ancestors ate the manna in the desert
 but they died; ","this is the bread that comes down from heaven so that one may eat it and not die. ","I am the living bread that came down from heaven; whoever eats this bread will live forever; and the bread that I will give is my flesh for the life of the world.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cAmen
 amen
 I say to you
 unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood
 you do not have life within you. ","Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life
 and I will raise him on the last day. ","For my flesh is true food
 and my blood is true drink. ","Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me and I in him. ","Just as the living Father sent me and I have life because of the Father
 so also the one who feeds on me will have life because of me. ","This is the bread that came down from heaven. Unlike your ancestors who ate and still died
 whoever eats this bread will live forever.\u201d ","Since Jesus knew that his disciples were murmuring about this
 he said to them
 \u201cDoes this shock you? ","What if you were to see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before? ","It is the spirit that gives life
 while the flesh is of no avail. The words I have spoken to you are spirit and life. ","But there are some of you who do not believe.\u201d Jesus knew from the beginning the ones who would not believe and the one who would betray him. ","And he said
 \u201cFor this reason I have told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted him by my Father.\u201d","Jesus then said to the Twelve
 \u201cDo you also want to leave?\u201d ","Jesus answered them
 \u201cDid I not choose you twelve? Yet is not one of you a devil?\u201d ","So his brothers said to him
 \u201cLeave here and go to Judea
 so that your disciples also may see the works you are doing. ","So Jesus said to them
 \u201cMy time is not yet here
 but the time is always right for you. ","The world cannot hate you
 but it hates me
 because I testify to it that its works are evil. ","You go up to the feast. I am not going up to this feast
 because my time has not yet been fulfilled.\u201d ","Jesus answered them and said
 \u201cMy teaching is not my own but is from the one who sent me. ","Whoever chooses to do his will shall know whether my teaching is from God or whether I speak on my own. ","Whoever speaks on his own seeks his own glory
 but whoever seeks the glory of the one who sent him is truthful
 and there is no wrong in him. ","Did not Moses give you the law? Yet none of you keeps the law. Why are you trying to kill me?\u201d ","Jesus answered and said to them
 \u201cI performed one work and all of you are amazed ","because of it. Moses gave you circumcision\u2014not that it came from Moses but rather from the patriarchs\u2014and you circumcise a man on the sabbath. ","If a man can receive circumcision on a sabbath so that the law of Moses may not be broken
 are you angry with me because I made a whole person well on a sabbath? ","Stop judging by appearances
 but judge justly.\u201d","So some of the inhabitants of Jerusalem said
 \u201cIs he not the one they are trying to kill? ","So Jesus cried out in the temple area as he was teaching and said
 \u201cYou know me and also know where I am from. Yet I did not come on my own
 but the one who sent me
 whom you do not know
 is true. ","I know him
 because I am from him
 and he sent me.\u201d ","So Jesus said
 \u201cI will be with you only a little while longer
 and then I will go to the one who sent me. ","You will look for me but not find 
 and where I am you cannot come.\u201d ","So the Jews said to one another
 \u201cWhere is he going that we will not find him? Surely he is not going to the dispersion among the Greeks to teach the Greeks
 is he? ","On the last and greatest day of the feast
 Jesus stood up and exclaimed
 \u201cLet anyone who thirsts come to me and drink. ","Whoever believes in me
 as scripture says: \u2018Rivers of living water will flow from within him.\u2019\u201d","He said this in reference to the Spirit that those who came to believe in him were to receive. There was
 of course
 no Spirit yet
 because Jesus had not yet been glorified.","They said to him
 \u201cTeacher
 this woman was caught in the very act of committing adultery. ","But when they continued asking him
 he straightened up and said to them
 \u201cLet the one among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.\u201d ","Then Jesus straightened up and said to her
 \u201cWoman
 where are they? Has no one condemned you?\u201d ","She replied
 \u201cNo one
 sir.\u201d Then Jesus said
 \u201cNeither do I condemn you. Go
  from now on do not sin any more.\u201d]","Jesus spoke to them again
 saying
 \u201cI am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness
 but will have the light of life.\u201d ","Jesus answered and said to them
 \u201cEven if I do testify on my own behalf
 my testimony can be verified
 because I know where I came from and where I am going. But you do not know where I come from or where I am going. ","You judge by appearances
 but I do not judge anyone. ","And even if I should judge
 my judgment is valid
 because I am not alone
 but it is I and the Father who sent me. ","Even in your law it is written that the testimony of two men can be verified. ","I testify on my behalf and so does the Father who sent me.\u201d ","So they said to him
 \u201cWhere is your father?\u201d Jesus answered
 \u201cYou know neither me nor my Father. If you knew me
 you would know my Father also.\u201d ","He said to them again
 \u201cI am going away and you will look for me
 but you will die in your sin. Where I am going you cannot come.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cYou belong to what is below
 I belong to what is above. You belong to this world
 but I do not belong to this world. ","That is why I told you that you will die in your sins. For if you do not believe that I AM
 you will die in your sins.\u201d ","So they said to him
 \u201cWho are you?\u201d Jesus said to them
 \u201cWhat I told you from the beginning. ","I have much to say about you in condemnation. But the one who sent me is true
 and what I heard from him I tell the world.\u201d ","So Jesus said [to them]
 \u201cWhen you lift up the Son of Man
 then you will realize that I AM
 and that I do nothing on my own
 but I say only what the Father taught me. ","The one who sent me is with me. He has not left me alone
 because I always do what is pleasing to him.\u201d ","Jesus then said to those Jews who believed in him
 \u201cIf you remain in my word
 you will truly be my disciples
 ","and you will know the truth
 and the truth will set you free.\u201d ","Jesus answered them
 \u201cAmen
 amen
 I say to you
 everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin. ","A slave does not remain in a household forever
 but a son always remains. ","So if a son frees you
 then you will truly be free. ","I know that you are descendants of Abraham. But you are trying to kill me
 because my word has no room among you. ","I tell you what I have seen in the Father\u2019s presence; then do what you have heard from the Father.\u201d","They answered and said to him
 \u201cOur father is Abraham.\u201d Jesus said to them
 \u201cIf you were Abraham\u2019s children
 you would be doing the works of Abraham. ","But now you are trying to kill me
 a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God; Abraham did not do this. ","You are doing the works of your father!\u201d  they said to him
 \u201cWe are not illegitimate. We have one Father
 God.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cIf God were your Father
 you would love me
 for I came from God and am here; I did not come on my own
 but he sent me. ","Why do you not understand what I am saying? Because you cannot bear to hear my word. ","You belong to your father the devil and you willingly carry out your father\u2019s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in truth
 because there is no truth in him. When he tells a lie
 he speaks in character
 because he is a liar and the father of lies. ","But because I speak the truth
 you do not believe me. ","Can any of you charge me with sin? If I am telling the truth
 why do you not believe me? ","Whoever belongs to God hears the words of God; for this reason you do not listen
 because you do not belong to God.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cI am not possessed; I honor my Father
 but you dishonor me. ","I do not seek my own glory; there is one who seeks it and he is the one who judges. ","Amen
 amen
 I say to you
 whoever keeps my word will never see death.\u201d "," the Jews said to him
 \u201cNow we are sure that you are possessed. Abraham died
 as did the prophets
 yet you say
 \u2018Whoever keeps my word will never taste death.\u2019 ","Jesus answered
 \u201cIf I glorify myself
 my glory is worth nothing; but it is my Father who glorifies me
 of whom you say
 \u2018He is our God.\u2019 ","You do not know him
 but I know him. And if I should say that I do not know him
 I would be like you a liar. But I do know him and I keep his word. ","Abraham your father rejoiced to see my day; he saw it and was glad. ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cAmen
 amen
 I say to you
 before Abraham came to be
 I AM.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cNeither he nor his parents sinned; it is so that the works of God might be made visible through him. ","We have to do the works of the one who sent me while it is day. Night is coming when no one can work. ","While I am in the world
 I am the light of the world.\u201d ","and said to him
 \u201cGo wash in the Pool of Siloam\u201d (which means Sent). So he went and washed
 and came back able to see.","He replied
 \u201cThe man called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes and told me
 \u2018Go to Siloam and wash.\u2019 So I went there and washed and was able to see.\u201d ","And they said to him
 \u201cWhere is he?\u201d He said
 \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d","So a second time they called the man who had been blind and said to him
 \u201cGive God the praise! We know that this man is a sinner.\u201d ","He replied
 \u201cIf he is a sinner
 I do not know. One thing I do know is that I was blind and now I see.\u201d ","So they said to him
 \u201cWhat did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?\u201d ","He answered them
 \u201cI told you already and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his disciples
 too?\u201d ","When Jesus heard that they had thrown him out
 he found him and said
 \u201cDo you believe in the Son of Man?\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cYou have seen him and the one speaking with you is he.\u201d ","Then Jesus said
 \u201cI came into this world for judgment
 so that those who do not see might see
 and those who do see might become blind.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cIf you were blind
 you would have no sin; but now you are saying
 \u2018We see
\u2019 so your sin remains.","\u201cAmen
 amen
 I say to you
 whoever does not enter a sheepfold through the gate but climbs over elsewhere is a thief and a robber.","But whoever enters through the gate is the shepherd of the sheep. ","The gatekeeper opens it for him
 and the sheep hear his voice
 as he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. ","When he has driven out all his own
 he walks ahead of them
 and the sheep follow him
 because they recognize his voice. ","But they will not follow a stranger; they will run away from him
 because they do not recognize the voice of strangers.\u201d ","So Jesus said again
 \u201cAmen
 amen
 I say to you
 I am the gate for the sheep. ","All who came [before me] are thieves and robbers
 but the sheep did not listen to them. ","I am the gate. Whoever enters through me will be saved
 and will come in and go out and find pasture. ","A thief comes only to steal and slaughter and destroy; I came so that they might have life and have it more abundantly. ","I am the good shepherd. A good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. ","A hired man
 who is not a shepherd and whose sheep are not his own
 sees a wolf coming and leaves the sheep and runs away
 and the wolf catches and scatters them. ","This is because he works for pay and has no concern for the sheep. ","I am the good shepherd
 and I know mine and mine know me
 ","just as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I will lay down my life for the sheep. ","I have other sheep that do not belong to this fold. These also I must lead
 and they will hear my voice
 and there will be one flock
 one shepherd. ","This is why the Father loves me
 because I lay down my life in order to take it up again. ","No one takes it from me
 but I lay it down on my own. I have power to lay it down
 and power to take it up again. This command I have received from my Father.\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cI told you and you do not believe. The works I do in my Father\u2019s name testify to me. ","But you do not believe
 because you are not among my sheep. ","My sheep hear my voice; I know them
 and they follow me. ","I give them eternal life
 and they shall never perish. No one can take them out of my hand. ","My Father
 who has given them to me
 is greater than all
 and no one can take them out of the Father\u2019s hand. ","The Father and I are one.\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cI have shown you many good works from my Father. For which of these are you trying to stone me?\u201d ","Jesus answered them
 \u201cIs it not written in your law
 \u2018I said
 \u201cYou are gods\u201d\u2019? ","If it calls them gods to whom the word of God came
 and scripture cannot be set aside
 ","can you say that the one whom the Father has consecrated and sent into the world blasphemes because I said
 \u2018I am the Son of God\u2019? ","If I do not perform my Father\u2019s works
 do not believe me; ","but if I perform them
 even if you do not believe me
 believe the works
 so that you may realize [and understand] that the Father is in me and I am in the Father.\u201d ","When Jesus heard this he said
 \u201cThis illness is not to end in death
 but is for the glory of God
 that the Son of God may be glorified through it.\u201d ","Then after this he said to his disciples
 \u201cLet us go back to Judea.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cAre there not twelve hours in a day? If one walks during the day
 he does not stumble
 because he sees the light of this world. ","But if one walks at night
 he stumbles
 because the light is not in him.\u201d ","He said this
 and then told them
 \u201cOur friend Lazarus is asleep
 but I am going to awaken him.\u201d ","So then Jesus said to them clearly
 \u201cLazarus has died. ","And I am glad for you that I was not there
 that you may believe. Let us go to him.\u201d ","So Thomas
 called Didymus
 said to his fellow disciples
 \u201cLet us also go to die with him.\u201d","Jesus said to her
 \u201cYour brother will rise.\u201d ","Jesus told her
 \u201cI am the resurrection and the life; whoever believes in me
 even if he dies
 will live
 ","and everyone who lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?\u201d ","She said to him
 \u201cYes
 Lord. I have come to believe that you are the Messiah
 the Son of God
 the one who is coming into the world.\u201d","When Mary came to where Jesus was and saw him
 she fell at his feet and said to him
 \u201cLord

 my brother would not have died.\u201d ","and said
 \u201cWhere have you laid him?\u201d They said to him
 \u201cSir

 \u201cTake away the stone.\u201d Martha

 \u201cLord
 by now there will be a stench; he has been dead for four days.\u201d ","Jesus said to her
 \u201cDid I not tell you that if you believe you will see the glory of God?\u201d ","So they took away the stone. And Jesus raised his eyes and said
 \u201cFather
 I thank you for hearing me. ","I know that you always hear me; but because of the crowd here I have said this

 he cried out in a loud voice
 \u201cLazarus

 \u201cUntie him and let him go.\u201d","So Jesus said
 \u201cLeave her alone. Let her keep this for the day of my burial. ","You always have the poor with you
 but you do not always have me.\u201d","So the crowd that was with him when he called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from death continued to testify. ","So the Pharisees said to one another
 \u201cYou see that you are gaining nothing. Look
 the whole world has gone after him.\u201d","They came to Philip
 who was from Bethsaida in Galilee
 and asked him
 \u201cSir
 we would like to see Jesus.\u201d ","Jesus answered them
 \u201cThe hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. ","Amen
 amen
 I say to you
 unless a grain of wheat falls to the ground and dies
 it remains just a grain of wheat; but if it dies
 it produces much fruit. ","Whoever loves his life loses it
 and whoever hates his life in this world will preserve it for eternal life. ","Whoever serves me must follow me
 and where I am
 there also will my servant be. The Father will honor whoever serves me.","\u201cI am troubled now. Yet what should I say? \u2018Father
 save me from this hour\u2019? But it was for this purpose that I came to this hour. ","Father
 glorify your name.\u201d Then a voice came from heaven
 \u201cI have glorified it and will glorify it again.\u201d ","Jesus answered and said
 \u201cThis voice did not come for my sake but for yours. ","Now is the time of judgment on this world; now the ruler of this world will be driven out. ","And when I am lifted up from the earth
 I will draw everyone to myself.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cThe light will be among you only a little while. Walk while you have the light
 so that darkness may not overcome you. Whoever walks in the dark does not know where he is going. ","While you have the light
 believe in the light
 so that you may become children of the light.\u201d After he had said this
 Jesus left and hid from them.","Jesus cried out and said
 \u201cWhoever believes in me believes not only in me but also in the one who sent me
","and whoever sees me sees the one who sent me. ","I came into the world as light
 so that everyone who believes in me might not remain in darkness. ","And if anyone hears my words and does not observe them
 I do not condemn him
 for I did not come to condemn the world but to save the world. ","Whoever rejects me and does not accept my words has something to judge him: the word that I spoke
 it will condemn him on the last day
 ","because I did not speak on my own
 but the Father who sent me commanded me what to say and speak. ","And I know that his commandment is eternal life. So what I say
 I say as the Father told me.\u201d","Jesus answered and said to him
 \u201cWhat I am doing
 you do not understand now
 but you will understand later.\u201d ","Peter said to him
 \u201cYou will never wash my feet.\u201d Jesus answered him
 \u201cUnless I wash you
 you will have no inheritance with me.\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cWhoever has bathed has no need except to have his feet washed
 for he is clean all over; so you are clean
 but not all.\u201d ","For he knew who would betray him; for this reason
 he said
 \u201cNot all of you are clean.\u201d","So when he had washed their feet  put his garments back on and reclined at table again
 he said to them
 \u201cDo you realize what I have done for you? ","You call me \u2018teacher\u2019 and \u2018master
\u2019 and rightly so
 for indeed I am. ","If I
 therefore
 the master and teacher
 have washed your feet
 you ought to wash one another\u2019s feet. ","I have given you a model to follow
 so that as I have done for you
 you should also do. ","Amen
 amen
 I say to you
 no slave is greater than his master nor any messenger greater than the one who sent him. ","If you understand this
 blessed are you if you do it. ","I am not speaking of all of you. I know those whom I have chosen. But so that the scripture might be fulfilled
 \u2018The one who ate my food has raised his heel against me.\u2019 ","From now on I am telling you before it happens
 so that when it happens you may believe that I AM. ","Amen
 amen
 I say to you
 whoever receives the one I send receives me
 and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me.\u201d","When he had said this
 Jesus was deeply troubled and testified
 \u201cAmen
 amen
 I say to you
 one of you will betray me.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cIt is the one to whom I hand the morsel after I have dipped it.\u201d So he dipped the morsel and [took it and] handed it to Judas
 son of Simon the Iscariot. ","After he took the morsel
 Satan entered him. So Jesus said to him
 \u201cWhat you are going to do
 do quickly.\u201d ","When he had left
 Jesus said
 \u201cNow is the Son of Man glorified
 and God is glorified in him.","[If God is glorified in him
] God will also glorify him in himself
 and he will glorify him at once. ","My children
 I will be with you only a little while longer. You will look for me
 and as I told the Jews
 \u2018Where I go you cannot come
\u2019 so now I say it to you. ","I give you a new commandment: love one another. As I have loved you
 so you also should love one another. ","This is how all will know that you are my disciples
 if you have love for one another.\u201d","Simon Peter said to him
 \u201cMaster
 where are you going?\u201d Jesus answered 
 \u201cWhere I am going
 you cannot follow me now
 though you will follow later.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cWill you lay down your life for me? Amen
 amen

 I will come back again and take you to myself

 \u201cI am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. ","If you know me
 then you will also know my Father. From now on you do know him and have seen him.\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cHave I been with you for so long a time and you still do not know me
 Philip? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say
 \u2018Show us the Father\u2019? ","Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I speak to you I do not speak on my own. The Father who dwells in me is doing his works. ","Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me

 believe because of the works themselves. ","Amen
 amen
 I say to you
 whoever believes in me will do the works that I do
 and will do greater ones than these
 because I am going to the Father. ","And whatever you ask in my name
 I will do
 so that the Father may be glorified in the Son. ","If you ask anything of me in my name
 I will do it.","\u201cIf you love me
 you will keep my commandments.","And I will ask the Father
 and he will give you another Advocate to be with you always
 ","the Spirit of truth

 because it neither sees nor knows it. But you know it
 because it remains with you
 and will be in you. ","I will not leave you orphans; I will come to you. ","In a little while the world will no longer see me
 but you will see me
 because I live and you will live. ","On that day you will realize that I am in my Father and you are in me and I in you. ","Whoever has my commandments and observes them is the one who loves me. And whoever loves me will be loved by my Father
 and I will love him and reveal myself to him.\u201d ","Judas
 not the Iscariot
 said to him
 \u201cMaster
  what happened that you will reveal yourself to us and not to the world?\u201d ","Jesus answered and said to him
 \u201cWhoever loves me will keep my word
 and my Father will love him

 the holy Spirit that the Father will send in my name\u2014he will teach you everything and remind you of all that  told you. ","Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give it to you. Do not let your hearts be troubled or afraid. ","You heard me tell you
 \u2018I am going away and I will come back to you.\u2019 If you loved me
 you would rejoice that I am going to the Father; for the Father is greater than I. ","And now I have told you this before it happens
 so that when it happens you may believe. ","I will no longer speak much with you
 for the ruler of the world is coming. He has no power over me
 ","but the world must know that I love the Father and that I do just as the Father has commanded me. Get up
 let us go.","\u201cI am the true vine
 and my Father is the vine grower.","He takes away every branch in me that does not bear fruit
 and every one that does he prunes so that it bears more fruit. ","You are already pruned because of the word that I spoke to you. ","Remain in me
 as I remain in you. Just as a branch cannot bear fruit on its own unless it remains on the vine
 so neither can you unless you remain in me. ","I am the vine
 you are the branches. Whoever remains in me and I in him will bear much fruit
 because without me you can do nothing. ","Anyone who does not remain in me will be thrown out like a branch and wither; people will gather them and throw them into a fire and they will be burned. ","If you remain in me and my words remain in you
 ask for whatever you want and it will be done for you. ","By this is my Father glorified
 that you bear much fruit and become my disciples. ","As the Father loves me
 so I also love you. Remain in my love. ","If you keep my commandments
 you will remain in my love
 just as I have kept my Father\u2019s commandments and remain in his love.","\u201cI have told you this so that my joy may be in you and your joy may be complete. ","This is my commandment: love one another as I love you. ","No one has greater love than this
 to lay down one\u2019s life for one\u2019s friends. ","You are my friends if you do what I command you. ","I no longer call you slaves
 because a slave does not know what his master is doing. I have called you friends
 because I have told you everything I have heard from my Father. ","It was not you who chose me
 but I who chose you and appointed you to go and bear fruit that will remain
 so that whatever you ask the Father in my name he may give you. ","This I command you: love one another.","\u201cIf the world hates you
 realize that it hated me first. ","If you belonged to the world
 the world would love its own; but because you do not belong to the world
 and I have chosen you out of the world
 the world hates you. ","Remember the word I spoke to you
 \u2018No slave is greater than his master.\u2019 If they persecuted me
 they will also persecute you. If they kept my word
 they will also keep yours. ","And they will do all these things to you on account of my name
 because they do not know the one who sent me. ","If I had not come and spoken to them
 they would have no sin; but as it is they have no excuse for their sin. ","Whoever hates me also hates my Father. ","If I had not done works among them that no one else ever did
 they would not have sin; but as it is
 they have seen and hated both me and my Father. ","But in order that the word written in their law might be fulfilled
 \u2018They hated me without cause.\u2019","\u201cWhen the Advocate comes whom I will send you from the Father
 the Spirit of truth that proceeds from the Father
 he will testify to me. ","And you also testify
 because you have been with me from the beginning.","\u201cI have told you this so that you may not fall away. ","They will expel you from the synagogues; in fact
 the hour is coming when everyone who kills you will think he is offering worship to God. ","They will do this because they have not known either the Father or me. ","I have told you this so that when their hour comes you may remember that I told you. \u201cI did not tell you this from the beginning
 because I was with you.","But now I am going to the one who sent me
 and not one of you asks me
 \u2018Where are you going?\u2019 ","But because I told you this
 grief has filled your hearts. ","But I tell you the truth
 it is better for you that I go. For if I do not go
 the Advocate will not come to you. But if I go
 I will send him to you. ","And when he comes he will convict the world in regard to sin and righteousness and condemnation: ","sin
 because they do not believe in me; ","righteousness
 because I am going to the Father and you will no longer see me; ","condemnation
 because the ruler of this world has been condemned.","\u201cI have much more to tell you
 but you cannot bear it now. ","But when he comes
 the Spirit of truth
 he will guide you to all truth. He will not speak on his own
 but he will speak what he hears
 and will declare to you the things that are coming. ","He will glorify me
 because he will take from what is mine and declare it to you. ","Everything that the Father has is mine; for this reason I told you that he will take from what is mine and declare it to you.","\u201cA little while and you will no longer see me
 and again a little while later and you will see me.\u201d ","So some of his disciples said to one another
 \u201cWhat does this mean that he is saying to us
 \u2018A little while and you will not see me
 and again a little while and you will see me
\u2019 and \u2018Because I am going to the Father\u2019?\u201d ","So they said
 \u201cWhat is this \u2018little while\u2019 [of which he speaks]? We do not know what he means.\u201d ","Jesus knew that they wanted to ask him
 so he said to them
 \u201cAre you discussing with one another what I said
 \u2018A little while and you will not see me
 and again a little while and you will see me\u2019? ","Amen
 amen
 I say to you
 you will weep and mourn
 while the world rejoices; you will grieve
 but your grief will become joy. ","When a woman is in labor
 she is in anguish because her hour has arrived; but when she has given birth to a child
 she no longer remembers the pain because of her joy that a child has been born into the world. ","So you also are now in anguish. But I will see you again
 and your hearts will rejoice
 and no one will take your joy away from you. ","On that day you will not question me about anything. Amen
 amen
 I say to you
 whatever you ask the Father in my name he will give you. ","Until now you have not asked anything in my name; ask and you will receive
 so that your joy may be complete.","\u201cI have told you this in figures of speech. The hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figures but I will tell you clearly about the Father. ","On that day you will ask in my name
 and I do not tell you that I will ask the Father for you. ","For the Father himself loves you
 because you have loved me and have come to believe that I came from God. ","I came from the Father and have come into the world. Now I am leaving the world and going back to the Father.\u201d ","Jesus answered them
 \u201cDo you believe now? ","Behold
 the hour is coming and has arrived when each of you will be scattered to his own home and you will leave me alone. But I am not alone
 because the Father is with me. ","I have told you this so that you might have peace in me. In the world you will have trouble
 but take courage
 I have conquered the world.\u201d","When Jesus had said this
 he raised his eyes to heaven and said
 \u201cFather
 the hour has come. Give glory to your son
 so that your son may glorify you
","just as you gave him authority over all people
 so that he may give eternal life to all you gave him. ","Now this is eternal life
 that they should know you
 the only true God
 and the one whom you sent
 Jesus Christ. ","I glorified you on earth by accomplishing the work that you gave me to do. ","Now glorify me
 Father
 with you
 with the glory that I had with you before the world began.","\u201cI revealed your name to those whom you gave me out of the world. They belonged to you
 and you gave them to me
 and they have kept your word. ","Now they know that everything you gave me is from you
 ","because the words you gave to me I have given to them
 and they accepted them and truly understood that I came from you
 and they have believed that you sent me. ","I pray for them. I do not pray for the world but for the ones you have given me
 because they are yours
 ","and everything of mine is yours and everything of yours is mine
 and I have been glorified in them. ","And now I will no longer be in the world
 but they are in the world
 while I am coming to you. Holy Father
 keep them in your name that you have given me
 so that they may be one just as we are. ","When I was with them I protected them in your name that you gave me
 and I guarded them
 and none of them was lost except the son of destruction
 in order that the scripture might be fulfilled. ","But now I am coming to you. I speak this in the world so that they may share my joy completely. ","I gave them your word
 and the world hated them
 because they do not belong to the world any more than I belong to the world. ","I do not ask that you take them out of the world but that you keep them from the evil one. ","They do not belong to the world any more than I belong to the world. ","Consecrate them in the truth. Your word is truth. ","As you sent me into the world
 so I sent them into the world. ","And I consecrate myself for them
 so that they also may be consecrated in truth.","\u201cI pray not only for them
 but also for those who will believe in me through their word
 ","so that they may all be one
 as you

 are in me and I in you

 so that they may be one
 as we are one
 ","I in them and you in me

 they are your gift to me. I wish that where I am they also may be with me
 that they may see my glory that you gave me
 because you loved me before the foundation of the world. ","Righteous Father
 the world also does not know you
 but I know you
 and they know that you sent me. ","I made known to them your name and I will make it known
 that the love with which you loved me may be in them and I in them.\u201d","Jesus
 knowing everything that was going to happen to him
 went out and said to them
 \u201cWhom are you looking for?\u201d ","They answered him
 \u201cJesus the Nazorean.\u201d He said to them
 \u201cI AM.\u201d Judas his betrayer was also with them. ","When he said to them
 \u201cI AM
\u201d they turned away and fell to the ground. ","So he again asked them
 \u201cWhom are you looking for?\u201d They said
 \u201cJesus the Nazorean.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cI told you that I AM. So if you are looking for me
 let these men go.\u201d ","Jesus said to Peter
 \u201cPut your sword into its scabbard. Shall I not drink the cup that the Father gave me?\u201d","Then the maid who was the gatekeeper said to Peter
 \u201cYou are not one of this man\u2019s disciples
 are you?\u201d He said
 \u201cI am not.\u201d ","Jesus answered him
 \u201cI have spoken publicly to the world. I have always taught in a synagogue or in the temple area where all the Jews gather
 and in secret I have said nothing. ","Why ask me? Ask those who heard me what I said to them. They know what I said.\u201d ","Jesus answered him
 \u201cIf I have spoken wrongly
 testify to the wrong; but if I have spoken rightly
 why do you strike me?\u201d ","At this
 Pilate said to them
 \u201cTake him yourselves
 and judge him according to your law.\u201d The Jews answered him
 \u201cWe do not have the right to execute anyone
\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cDo you say this on your own or have others told you about me?\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cMy kingdom does not belong to this world. If my kingdom did belong to this world
 my attendants  be fighting to keep me from being handed over to the Jews. But as it is
 my kingdom is not here.\u201d ","So Pilate said to him
 \u201cThen you are a king?\u201d Jesus answered
 \u201cYou say I am a king. For this I was born and for this I came into the world
 to testify to the truth. Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice.\u201d ","Once more Pilate went out and said to them
 \u201cLook
 I am bringing him out to you

 wearing the crown of thorns and the purple cloak. And he said to them
 \u201cBehold
 the man!\u201d ","When the chief priests and the guards saw him they cried out
 \u201cCrucify him
 crucify him!\u201d Pilate said to them
 \u201cTake him yourselves and crucify him. I find no guilt in him.\u201d ","Jesus answered 
 \u201cYou would have no power over me if it had not been given to you from above. For this reason the one who handed me over to you has the greater sin.\u201d ","It was preparation day for Passover
 and it was about noon. And he said to the Jews
 \u201cBehold
 your king!\u201d ","When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple there whom he loved
 he said to his mother
 \u201cWoman

 your son.\u201d ","Then he said to the disciple
 \u201cBehold

 aware that everything was now finished

 \u201cI thirst.\u201d ","When Jesus had taken the wine
 he said
 \u201cIt is finished.\u201d And bowing his head
 he handed over the spirit.","So she ran and went to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved

 \u201cWoman
 why are you weeping? Whom are you looking for?\u201d She thought it was the gardener and said to him
 \u201cSir

 \u201cMary!\u201d She turned and said to him in Hebrew
 \u201cRabbouni

 \u201cStop holding on to me

 when the doors were locked
 where the disciples were

 \u201cPeace be with you.\u201d "," said to them again
 \u201cPeace be with you. As the Father has sent me
 so I send you.\u201d ","And when he had said this
 he breathed on them and said to them
 \u201cReceive the holy Spirit. ","Whose sins you forgive are forgiven them

 I will not believe.\u201d ","Now a week later his disciples were again inside and Thomas was with them. Jesus came

 \u201cPut your finger here and see my hands
 and bring your hand and put it into my side

 \u201cHave you come to believe because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and have believed.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cChildren
 have you caught anything to eat?\u201d They answered him
 \u201cNo.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cBring some of the fish you just caught.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cCome
 have breakfast.\u201d And none of the disciples dared to ask him
 \u201cWho are you?\u201d because they realized it was the Lord. ","When they had finished breakfast
 Jesus said to Simon Peter
 \u201cSimon

 \u201cYes
 Lord

 \u201cFeed my lambs.\u201d ","He then said to him a second time
 \u201cSimon
 son of John

 \u201cTend my sheep.\u201d ","He said to him the third time
 \u201cSimon
 son of John
 do you love me?\u201d Peter was distressed that he had said to him a third time
 \u201cDo you love me?\u201d and he said to him
 \u201cLord
 you know everything; you know that I love you.\u201d  said to him
 \u201cFeed my sheep. ","Amen
 amen

 he said to him
 \u201cFollow me.\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cWhat if I want him to remain until I come? What concern is it of yours? You follow me.\u201d ","So the word spread among the brothers that that disciple would not die. But Jesus had not told him that he would not die

 \u201cNo.\u201d","Then they said to him

 \u201cHere is truly an Israelite
 in whom there is no deceit!\u201d","Nathanael *said to Him
 \u201cHow do You know me?\u201d Jesus answered and said to him
 \u201cBefore Philip called you
 when you were under the fig tree
 I saw you.\u201d","Jesus answered and said to him
 \u201cBecause I said to you that I saw you under the fig tree
 do you believe? You will see greater things than these.\u201d","And He *said to him
 \u201cTruly
 truly
 I say to you
 you will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.\u201d","And Jesus *said to her
 \u201cWhat business do you have with Me
 woman? My hour has not yet come.\u201d","Jesus *said to them
 \u201cFill the waterpots with water.\u201d So they filled them up to the brim.","And He *said to them
 \u201cDraw some out now and take it to the headwaiter.\u201d And they took it to him.","and to those who were selling the doves He said
 \u201cTake these things away from here; stop making My Father\u2019s house a place of business!\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cDestroy this temple
 and in three days I will raise it up.\u201d","Jesus responded and said to him
 \u201cTruly
 truly
 I say to you
 unless someone is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cTruly
 truly
 I say to you
 unless someone is born of water and the Spirit
 he cannot enter the kingdom of God.","That which has been born of the flesh is flesh
 and that which has been born of the Spirit is spirit.","Do not be amazed that I said to you
 \u2018You must be born again.\u2019","The wind blows where it wishes
 and you hear the sound of it
 but you do not know where it is coming from and where it is going; so is everyone who has been born of the Spirit.\u201d","Jesus answered and said to him
 \u201cYou are the teacher of Israel
 and yet you do not understand these things?","Truly
 truly
 I say to you
 we speak of what we know and testify of what we have seen
 and you people do not accept our testimony.","If I told you earthly things and you do not believe
 how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?","No one has ascended into heaven
 except He who descended from heaven: the Son of Man.","And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness
 so must the Son of Man be lifted up
","so that everyone who believes will have eternal life in Him.","\u201cFor God so loved the world
 that He gave His only Son
 so that everyone who believes in Him will not perish
 but have eternal life.","For God did not send the Son into the world to judge the world
 but so that the world might be saved through Him.","The one who believes in Him is not judged; the one who does not believe has been judged already
 because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God.","And this is the judgment
 that the Light has come into the world
 and people loved the darkness rather than the Light; for their deeds were evil.","For everyone who does evil hates the Light
 and does not come to the Light
 so that his deeds will not be exposed.","But the one who practices the truth comes to the Light
 so that his deeds will be revealed as having been performed in God.\u201d","And they came to John and said to him
 \u201cRabbi
 He who was with you beyond the Jordan
 to whom you have testified\u2014behold
 He is baptizing and all the people are coming to Him.\u201d","A woman of Samaria *came to draw water. Jesus *said to her
 \u201cGive Me a drink.\u201d","Jesus replied to her
 \u201cIf you knew the gift of God
 and who it is who is saying to you
 \u2018Give Me a drink
\u2019 you would have asked Him
 and He would have given you living water.\u201d","Jesus answered and said to her
 \u201cEveryone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again;","but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall never be thirsty; but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up to eternal life.\u201d","The woman *said to Him
 \u201cSir
 give me this water so that I will not be thirsty
 nor come all the way here to draw water.\u201d","He *said to her
 \u201cGo
 call your husband and come here.\u201d","The woman answered and said to Him
 \u201cI have no husband.\u201d Jesus *said to her
 \u201cYou have correctly said
 \u2018I have no husband\u2019;","for you have had five husbands
 and the one whom you now have is not your husband; this which you have said is true.\u201d","Jesus *said to her
 \u201cBelieve Me
 woman
 that a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.","You Samaritans worship what you do not know; we worship what we do know
 because salvation is from the Jews.","But a time is coming
 and even now has arrived
 when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for such people the Father seeks to be His worshipers.","God is spirit
 and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.\u201d","Jesus *said to her
 \u201cI am He
 the One speaking to you.\u201d","But He said to them
 \u201cI have food to eat that you do not know about.\u201d","Jesus *said to them
 \u201cMy food is to do the will of Him who sent Me
 and to accomplish His work.","Do you not say
 \u2018There are still four months
 and then comes the harvest\u2019? Behold
 I tell you
 raise your eyes and observe the fields
 that they are white for harvest.","Already the one who reaps is receiving wages and is gathering fruit for eternal life
 so that the one who sows and the one who reaps may rejoice together.","For in this case the saying is true: \u2018One sows and another reaps.\u2019","I sent you to reap that for which you have not labored; others have labored
 and you have come into their labor.\u201d","and they were saying to the woman
 \u201cIt is no longer because of what you said that we believe
 for we have heard for ourselves and know that this One truly is the Savior of the world.\u201d","Then Jesus said to him
 \u201cUnless you people see signs and wonders
 you simply will not believe.\u201d","Jesus *said to him
 \u201cGo; your son is alive.\u201d The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and went home.","So he inquired of them the hour when he began to get better. Then they said to him
 \u201cYesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.\u201d","So the father knew that it was at that hour in which Jesus said to him
 \u201cYour son is alive\u201d; and he himself believed
 and his entire household.","Jesus
 upon seeing this man lying there and knowing that he had already been in that condition for a long time
 *said to him
 \u201cDo you want to get well?\u201d","Jesus *said to him
 \u201cGet up
 pick up your pallet and walk.\u201d","But he answered them
 \u201cHe who made me well was the one who said to me
 \u2018Pick up your pallet and walk.\u2019\u201d","Afterward
 Jesus *found him in the temple and said to him
 \u201cBehold
 you have become well; do not sin anymore
 so that nothing worse happens to you.\u201d","But He answered them
 \u201cMy Father is working until now
 and I Myself am working.\u201d","Therefore Jesus answered and was saying to them
 \u201cTruly
 truly
 I say to you
 the Son can do nothing of Himself
 unless it is something He sees the Father doing; for whatever the Father does
 these things the Son also does in the same way.","For the Father loves the Son and shows Him all things that He Himself is doing; and the Father will show Him greater works than these
 so that you will be amazed.","For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life
 so the Son also gives life to whom He wishes.","For not even the Father judges anyone
 but He has given all judgment to the Son
","so that all will honor the Son just as they honor the Father. The one who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him.","\u201cTruly
 truly
 I say to you
 the one who hears My word
 and believes Him who sent Me
 has eternal life
 and does not come into judgment
 but has passed out of death into life.","Truly
 truly
 I say to you
 a time is coming and even now has arrived
 when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God
 and those who hear will live.","For just as the Father has life in Himself
 so He gave to the Son also to have life in Himself;","and He gave Him authority to execute judgment
 because He is the Son of Man.","Do not be amazed at this; for a time is coming when all who are in the tombs will hear His voice
","and will come out: those who did the good deeds to a resurrection of life
 those who committed the bad deeds to a resurrection of judgment.","\u201cI can do nothing on My own. As I hear
 I judge; and My judgment is righteous
 because I do not seek My own will but the will of Him who sent Me.","\u201cIf I alone testify about Myself
 My testimony is not true.","There is another who testifies about Me
 and I know that the testimony which He gives about Me is true.","You have sent messengers to John
 and he has testified to the truth.","But the testimony I receive is not from man
 but I say these things so that you may be saved.","He was the lamp that was burning and shining
 and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light.","But the testimony I have is greater than the testimony of John; for the works which the Father has given Me to accomplish\u2014the very works that I do\u2014testify about Me
 that the Father has sent Me.","And the Father who sent Me
 He has testified about Me. You have neither heard His voice at any time
 nor seen His form.","Also you do not have His word remaining in you
 because you do not believe Him whom He sent.","You examine the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is those very Scriptures that testify about Me;","and yet you are unwilling to come to Me so that you may have life.","I do not receive glory from people;","but I know you
 that you do not have the love of God in yourselves.","I have come in My Father\u2019s name
 and you do not receive Me; if another comes in his own name
 you will receive him.","How can you believe
 when you accept glory from one another and you do not seek the glory that is from the one and only God?","Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father; the one who accuses you is Moses
 in whom you have put your hope.","For if you believed Moses
 you would believe Me; for he wrote about Me.","But if you do not believe his writings
 how will you believe My words?\u201d","So Jesus
 after raising His eyes and seeing that a large crowd was coming to Him
 *said to Philip
 \u201cWhere are we to buy bread so that these people may eat?\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cHave the people recline to eat.\u201d Now there was plenty of grass in the place. So the men reclined
 about five thousand in number.","And when they had eaten their fill
 He *said to His disciples
 \u201cGather up the leftover pieces so that nothing will be lost.\u201d","But He *said to them
 \u201cIt is I; do not be afraid.\u201d","Jesus answered them and said
 \u201cTruly
 truly
 I say to you
 you seek Me
 not because you saw signs
 but because you ate some of the loaves and were filled.","Do not work for the food that perishes
 but for the food that lasts for eternal life
 which the Son of Man will give you
 for on Him the Father
 God
 has set His seal.\u201d","Jesus answered and said to them
 \u201cThis is the work of God
 that you believe in Him whom He has sent.\u201d","Jesus then said to them
 \u201cTruly
 truly
 I say to you
 it is not Moses who has given you the bread out of heaven
 but it is My Father who gives you the true bread out of heaven.","For the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven and gives life to the world.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cI am the bread of life; the one who comes to Me will not be hungry
 and the one who believes in Me will never be thirsty.","But I said to you that you have indeed seen Me
 and yet you do not believe.","Everything that the Father gives Me will come to Me
 and the one who comes to Me I certainly will not cast out.","For I have come down from heaven
 not to do My own will
 but the will of Him who sent Me.","And this is the will of Him who sent Me
 that of everything that He has given Me I will lose nothing
 but will raise it up on the last day.","For this is the will of My Father
 that everyone who sees the Son and believes in Him will have eternal life
 and I Myself will raise him up on the last day.\u201d","Jesus answered and said to them
 \u201cStop complaining among yourselves.","No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him; and I will raise him up on the last day.","It is written in the Prophets: \u2018And they shall all be taught of God.\u2019 Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father
 comes to Me.","Not that anyone has seen the Father
 except the One who is from God; He has seen the Father.","Truly
 truly
 I say to you
 the one who believes has eternal life.","I am the bread of life.","Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness
 and they died.","This is the bread that comes down out of heaven
 so that anyone may eat from it and not die.","I am the living bread that came down out of heaven; if anyone eats from this bread
 he will live forever; and the bread which I will give for the life of the world also is My flesh.\u201d","So Jesus said to them
 \u201cTruly
 truly
 I say to you
 unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood
 you have no life in yourselves.","The one who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life
 and I will raise him up on the last day.","For My flesh is true food
 and My blood is true drink.","The one who eats My flesh and drinks My blood remains in Me
 and I in him.","Just as the living Father sent Me
 and I live because of the Father
 the one who eats Me
 he also will live because of Me.","This is the bread that came down out of heaven
 not as the fathers ate and died; the one who eats this bread will live forever.\u201d","But Jesus
 aware that His disciples were complaining about this
 said to them
 \u201cIs this offensive to you?","What then if you see the Son of Man ascending to where He was before?","It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh provides no benefit; the words that I have spoken to you are spirit
 and are life.","But there are some of you who do not believe.\u201d For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe
 and who it was who would betray Him.","And He was saying
 \u201cFor this reason I have told you that no one can come to Me unless it has been granted him from the Father.\u201d","So Jesus said to the twelve
 \u201cYou do not want to leave also
 do you?\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cDid I Myself not choose you
 the twelve? And yet one of you is a devil.\u201d","So His brothers said to Him
 \u201cMove on from here and go into Judea
 so that Your disciples also may see Your works which You are doing.","So Jesus *said to them
 \u201cMy time is not yet here
 but your time is always ready.","The world cannot hate you
 but it hates Me because I testify about it
 that its deeds are evil.","Go up to the feast yourselves; I am not going up to this feast
 because My time has not yet fully arrived.\u201d","So Jesus answered them and said
 \u201cMy teaching is not My own
 but His who sent Me.","If anyone is willing to do His will
 he will know about the teaching
 whether it is of God
 or I am speaking from Myself.","The one who speaks from himself seeks his own glory; but He who is seeking the glory of the One who sent Him
 He is true
 and there is no unrighteousness in Him.","\u201cDid Moses not give you the Law
 and yet none of you carries out the Law? Why are you seeking to kill Me?\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cI did one deed
 and you all are astonished.","For this reason Moses has given you circumcision (not that it is from Moses
 but from the fathers)
 and even on a Sabbath you circumcise a man.","If a man receives circumcision on a Sabbath so that the Law of Moses will not be broken
 are you angry at Me because I made an entire man well on a Sabbath?","Do not judge by the outward appearance
 but judge with righteous judgment.\u201d","So some of the people of Jerusalem were saying
 \u201cIs this man not the one whom they are seeking to kill?","Then Jesus cried out in the temple
 teaching and saying
 \u201cYou both know Me and you know where I am from; and I have not come of Myself
 but He who sent Me is true
 whom you do not know.","I do know Him
 because I am from Him
 and He sent Me.\u201d","Therefore Jesus said
 \u201cFor a little while longer I am going to be with you
 and then I am going to Him who sent Me.","You will seek Me
 and will not find Me; and where I am
 you cannot come.\u201d","The Jews then said to one another
 \u201cWhere does this man intend to go that we will not find Him? He does not intend to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks
 and teach the Greeks
 does He?","Now on the last day
 the great day of the feast
 Jesus stood and cried out
 saying
 \u201cIf anyone is thirsty
 let him come to Me and drink.","The one who believes in Me
 as the Scripture said
 \u2018From his innermost being will flow rivers of living water.\u2019\u201d","But this He said in reference to the Spirit
 whom those who believed in Him were to receive; for the Spirit was not yet given
 because Jesus was not yet glorified.","they *said to Him
 \u201cTeacher
 this woman has been caught in the very act of committing adultery.","When they persisted in asking Him
 He straightened up and said to them
 \u201cHe who is without sin among you
 let him be the first to throw a stone at her.\u201d","And straightening up
 Jesus said to her
 \u201cWoman
 where are they? Did no one condemn you?\u201d","She said
 \u201cNo one
 Lord.\u201d And Jesus said
 \u201cI do not condemn you
 either. Go. From now on do not sin any longer.\u201d]]","Then Jesus again spoke to them
 saying
 \u201cI am the Light of the world; the one who follows Me will not walk in the darkness
 but will have the Light of life.\u201d","Jesus answered and said to them
 \u201cEven if I am testifying about Myself
 My testimony is true
 because I know where I came from and where I am going; but you do not know where I come from or where I am going.","You judge according to the flesh; I am not judging anyone.","But even if I do judge
 My judgment is true; for I am not alone in it
 but I and the Father who sent Me.","Even in your Law it has been written that the testimony of two people is true.","I am He who testifies about Myself
 and the Father who sent Me testifies about Me.\u201d","So they were saying to Him
 \u201cWhere is Your Father?\u201d Jesus answered
 \u201cYou know neither Me nor My Father; if you knew Me
 you would know My Father also.\u201d","Then He said again to them
 \u201cI am going away
 and you will look for Me
 and will die in your sin; where I am going
 you cannot come.\u201d","And He was saying to them
 \u201cYou are from below
 I am from above; you are of this world
 I am not of this world.","Therefore I said to you that you will die in your sins; for unless you believe that I am
 you will die in your sins.\u201d","Then they were saying to Him
 \u201cWho are You?\u201d Jesus said to them
 \u201cWhat have I even been saying to you from the beginning?","I have many things to say and to judge regarding you
 but He who sent Me is true; and the things which I heard from Him
 these I say to the world.\u201d","So Jesus said
 \u201cWhen you lift up the Son of Man
 then you will know that I am
 and I do nothing on My own
 but I say these things as the Father instructed Me.","And He who sent Me is with Me; He has not left Me alone
 for I always do the things that are pleasing to Him.\u201d","So Jesus was saying to those Jews who had believed Him
 \u201cIf you continue in My word
 then you are truly My disciples;","and you will know the truth
 and the truth will set you free.\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cTruly
 truly I say to you
 everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin.","Now the slave does not remain in the house forever; the son does remain forever.","So if the Son sets you free
 you really will be free.","I know that you are Abraham\u2019s descendants; yet you are seeking to kill Me
 because My word has no place in you.","I speak of the things which I have seen with My Father; therefore you also do the things which you heard from your father.\u201d","They answered and said to Him
 \u201cAbraham is our father.\u201d Jesus *said to them
 \u201cIf you are Abraham\u2019s children
 do the deeds of Abraham.","But as it is
 you are seeking to kill Me
 a man who has told you the truth
 which I heard from God; this Abraham did not do.","You are doing the deeds of your father.\u201d They said to Him
 \u201cWe were not born as a result of sexual immorality; we have one Father: God.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cIf God were your Father
 you would love Me
 for I came forth from God and am here; for I have not even come on My own
 but He sent Me.","Why do you not understand what I am saying? It is because you cannot listen to My word.","You are of your father the devil
 and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning
 and does not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him. Whenever he tells a lie
 he speaks from his own nature
 because he is a liar and the father of lies.","But because I say the truth
 you do not believe Me.","Which one of you convicts Me of sin? If I speak truth
 why do you not believe Me?","The one who is of God hears the words of God; for this reason you do not hear them
 because you are not of God.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cI do not have a demon; on the contrary
 I honor My Father
 and you dishonor Me.","But I am not seeking My glory; there is One who seeks it
 and judges.","Truly
 truly I say to you
 if anyone follows My word
 he will never see death.\u201d","The Jews said to Him
 \u201cNow we know that You have a demon. Abraham died
 and the prophets as well; and yet You say
 \u2018If anyone follows My word
 he will never taste of death.\u2019","Jesus answered
 \u201cIf I glorify Myself
 My glory is nothing; it is My Father who glorifies Me
 of whom you say
 \u2018He is our God\u2019;","and you have not come to know Him
 but I know Him. And if I say that I do not know Him
 I will be a liar like you; but I do know Him
 and I follow His word.","Your father Abraham was overjoyed that he would see My day
 and he saw it and rejoiced.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cTruly
 truly I say to you
 before Abraham was born
 I am.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cIt was neither that this man sinned
 nor his parents; but it was so that the works of God might be displayed in him.","We must carry out the works of Him who sent Me as long as it is day; night is coming
 when no one can work.","While I am in the world
 I am the Light of the world.\u201d","and said to him
 \u201cGo
 wash in the pool of Siloam\u201d (which is translated
 Sent). So he left and washed
 and came back seeing.","He answered
 \u201cThe man who is called Jesus made mud
 and spread it on my eyes
 and said to me
 \u2018Go to Siloam and wash\u2019; so I went away and washed
 and I received sight.\u201d","And they said to him
 \u201cWhere is He?\u201d He *said
 \u201cI do not know.\u201d","So for a second time they summoned the man who had been blind
 and said to him
 \u201cGive glory to God; we know that this man is a sinner.\u201d","He then answered
 \u201cWhether He is a sinner
 I do not know; one thing I do know
 that though I was blind
 now I see.\u201d","So they said to him
 \u201cWhat did He do to you? How did He open your eyes?\u201d","He answered them
 \u201cI told you already and you did not listen; why do you want to hear it again? You do not want to become His disciples too
 do you?\u201d","Jesus heard that they had put him out
 and upon finding him
 He said
 \u201cDo you believe in the Son of Man?\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cYou have both seen Him
 and He is the one who is talking with you.\u201d","And Jesus said
 \u201cFor judgment I came into this world
 so that those who do not see may see
 and those who see may become blind.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cIf you were blind
 you would have no sin; but now that you maintain
 \u2018We see
\u2019 your sin remains.","\u201cTruly
 truly I say to you
 the one who does not enter by the door into the fold of the sheep
 but climbs up some other way
 he is a thief and a robber.","But the one who enters by the door is a shepherd of the sheep.","To him the doorkeeper opens
 and the sheep listen to his voice
 and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.","When he puts all his own sheep outside
 he goes ahead of them
 and the sheep follow him because they know his voice.","However
 a stranger they simply will not follow
 but will flee from him
 because they do not know the voice of strangers.\u201d","So Jesus said to them again
 \u201cTruly
 truly I say to you
 I am the door of the sheep.","All those who came before Me are thieves and robbers
 but the sheep did not listen to them.","I am the door; if anyone enters through Me
 he will be saved
 and will go in and out and find pasture.","The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I came so that they would have life
 and have it abundantly.","\u201cI am the good shepherd; the good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.","He who is a hired hand
 and not a shepherd
 who is not the owner of the sheep
 sees the wolf coming
 and leaves the sheep and flees; and the wolf snatches them and scatters the flock.","He flees because he is a hired hand and does not care about the sheep.","I am the good shepherd
 and I know My own
 and My own know Me
","just as the Father knows Me and I know the Father; and I lay down My life for the sheep.","And I have other sheep that are not of this fold; I must bring them also
 and they will listen to My voice; and they will become one flock
 with one shepherd.","For this reason the Father loves Me
 because I lay down My life so that I may take it back.","No one has taken it away from Me
 but I lay it down on My own. I have authority to lay it down
 and I have authority to take it back. This commandment I received from My Father.\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cI told you
 and you do not believe; the works that I do in My Father\u2019s name
 these testify of Me.","But you do not believe
 because you are not of My sheep.","My sheep listen to My voice
 and I know them
 and they follow Me;","and I give them eternal life
 and they will never perish; and no one will snatch them out of My hand.","My Father
 who has given them to Me
 is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father\u2019s hand.","I and the Father are one.\u201d","Jesus replied to them
 \u201cI showed you many good works from the Father; for which of them are you stoning Me?\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cHas it not been written in your Law: \u2018I said
 you are gods\u2019?","If he called them gods
 to whom the word of God came (and the Scripture cannot be nullified)
","are you saying of Him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world
 \u2018You are blaspheming
\u2019 because I said
 \u2018I am the Son of God\u2019?","If I do not do the works of My Father
 do not believe Me;","but if I do them
 even though you do not believe Me
 believe the works
 so that you may know and understand that the Father is in Me
 and I in the Father.\u201d","But when Jesus heard this
 He said
 \u201cThis sickness is not meant for death
 but is for the glory of God
 so that the Son of God may be glorified by it.\u201d","Then after this He *said to the disciples
 \u201cLet\u2019s go to Judea again.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cAre there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks during the day
 he does not stumble
 because he sees the light of this world.","But if anyone walks during the night
 he stumbles
 because the light is not in him.\u201d","This He said
 and after this He *said to them
 \u201cOur friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I am going so that I may awaken him from sleep.\u201d","So Jesus then said to them plainly
 \u201cLazarus died
","and I am glad for your sakes that I was not there
 so that you may believe; but let\u2019s go to him.\u201d","Therefore Thomas
 who was called Didymus
 said to his fellow disciples
 \u201cLet\u2019s also go
 so that we may die with Him!\u201d","Jesus *said to her
 \u201cYour brother will rise from the dead.\u201d","Jesus said to her
 \u201cI am the resurrection and the life; the one who believes in Me will live
 even if he dies
","and everyone who lives and believes in Me will never die. Do you believe this?\u201d","She *said to Him
 \u201cYes
 Lord; I have come to believe that You are the Christ
 the Son of God
 and He who comes into the world.\u201d","So when Mary came to the place where Jesus was
 she saw Him and fell at His feet
 saying to Him
 \u201cLord
 if You had been here
 my brother would not have died.\u201d","and He said
 \u201cWhere have you laid him?\u201d They *said to Him
 \u201cLord
 come and see.\u201d","Jesus *said
 \u201cRemove the stone.\u201d Martha
 the sister of the deceased
 *said to Him
 \u201cLord
 by this time there will be a stench
 for he has been dead four days.\u201d","Jesus *said to her
 \u201cDid I not say to you that if you believe
 you will see the glory of God?\u201d","So they removed the stone. And Jesus raised His eyes
 and said
 \u201cFather
 I thank You that You have heard Me.","But I knew that You always hear Me; nevertheless
 because of the people standing around I said it
 so that they may believe that You sent Me.\u201d","And when He had said these things
 He cried out with a loud voice
 \u201cLazarus
 come out!\u201d","Out came the man who had died
 bound hand and foot with wrappings
 and his face was wrapped around with a cloth. Jesus *said to them
 \u201cUnbind him
 and let him go.\u201d","Therefore Jesus said
 \u201cLeave her alone
 so that she may keep it for the day of My burial.","For you always have the poor with you
 but you do not always have Me.\u201d","So the people
 who were with Him when He called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead
 continued to testify about Him.","So the Pharisees said to one another
 \u201cYou see that you are not accomplishing anything; look
 the world has gone after Him!\u201d","these people then came to Philip
 who was from Bethsaida of Galilee
 and were making a request of him
 saying
 \u201cSir
 we wish to see Jesus.\u201d","But Jesus *answered them by saying
 \u201cThe hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.","Truly
 truly I say to you
 unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies
 it remains alone; but if it dies
 it bears much fruit.","The one who loves his life loses it
 and the one who hates his life in this world will keep it to eternal life.","If anyone serves Me
 he must follow Me; and where I am
 there My servant will be also; if anyone serves Me
 the Father will honor him.","\u201cNow My soul has become troubled; and what am I to say? \u2018Father
 save Me from this hour\u2019? But for this purpose I came to this hour.","Father
 glorify Your name.\u201d Then a voice came out of heaven: \u201cI have both glorified it
 and will glorify it again.\u201d","Jesus responded and said
 \u201cThis voice has not come for My sake
 but for yours.","Now judgment is upon this world; now the ruler of this world will be cast out.","And I
 if I am lifted up from the earth
 will draw all people to Myself.\u201d","So Jesus said to them
 \u201cFor a little while longer the Light is among you. Walk while you have the Light
 so that darkness will not overtake you; also
 the one who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going.","While you have the Light
 believe in the Light
 so that you may become sons of Light.\u201d These things Jesus proclaimed
 and He went away and hid Himself from them.","Now Jesus cried out and said
 \u201cThe one who believes in Me
 does not believe only in Me
 but also in Him who sent Me.","And the one who sees Me sees Him who sent Me.","I have come as Light into the world
 so that no one who believes in Me will remain in darkness.","If anyone hears My teachings and does not keep them
 I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world
 but to save the world.","The one who rejects Me and does not accept My teachings has one who judges him: the word which I spoke. That will judge him on the last day.","For I did not speak on My own
 but the Father Himself who sent Me has given Me a commandment as to what to say and what to speak.","And I know that His commandment is eternal life; therefore the things I speak
 I speak just as the Father has told Me.\u201d","Jesus answered and said to him
 \u201cWhat I am doing
 you do not realize right now
 but you will understand later.\u201d","Peter *said to Him
 \u201cNever shall You wash my feet!\u201d Jesus answered him
 \u201cIf I do not wash you
 you have no place with Me.\u201d","Jesus *said to him
 \u201cHe who has bathed needs only to wash his feet; otherwise he is completely clean. And you are clean\u2014but not all of you.\u201d","For He knew the one who was betraying Him; it was for this reason that He said
 \u201cNot all of you are clean.\u201d","Then
 when He had washed their feet
 and taken His garments and reclined at the table again
 He said to them
 \u201cDo you know what I have done for you?","You call Me \u2018Teacher\u2019 and \u2018Lord\u2019; and you are correct
 for so I am.","So if I
 the Lord and the Teacher
 washed your feet
 you also ought to wash one another\u2019s feet.","For I gave you an example
 so that you also would do just as I did for you.","Truly
 truly I say to you
 a slave is not greater than his master
 nor is one who is sent greater than the one who sent him.","If you know these things
 you are blessed if you do them.","I am not speaking about all of you. I know the ones whom I have chosen; but this is happening so that the Scripture may be fulfilled
 \u2018He who eats My bread has lifted up his heel against Me.\u2019","From now on I am telling you before it happens
 so that when it does happen
 you may believe that I am He.","Truly
 truly I say to you
 the one who receives anyone I send
 receives Me; and the one who receives Me receives Him who sent Me.\u201d","When Jesus had said these things
 He became troubled in spirit
 and testified and said
 \u201cTruly
 truly I say to you that one of you will betray Me.\u201d","Jesus then *answered
 \u201cThat man is the one for whom I shall dip the piece of bread and give it to him.\u201d So when He had dipped the piece of bread
 He *took and *gave it to Judas
 the son of Simon Iscariot.","After this
 Satan then entered him. Therefore Jesus *said to him
 \u201cWhat you are doing
 do it quickly.\u201d","Therefore when he had left
 Jesus *said
 \u201cNow is the Son of Man glorified
 and God is glorified in Him;","if God is glorified in Him
 God will also glorify Him in Himself
 and will glorify Him immediately.","Little children
 I am still with you a little longer. You will look for Me; and just as I said to the Jews
 now I also say to you: \u2018Where I am going
 you cannot come.\u2019","I am giving you a new commandment
 that you love one another; just as I have loved you
 that you also love one another.","By this all people will know that you are My disciples: if you have love for one another.\u201d","Simon Peter *said to Him
 \u201cLord
 where are You going?\u201d Jesus answered
 \u201cWhere I am going
 you cannot follow Me now; but you will follow later.\u201d","Jesus *replied
 \u201cWill you lay down your life for Me? Truly
 truly I say to you
 a rooster will not crow until you deny Me three times.","\u201cDo not let your heart be troubled; believe in God
 believe also in Me.","In My Father\u2019s house are many rooms; if that were not so
 I would have told you
 because I am going there to prepare a place for you.","And if I go and prepare a place for you
 I am coming again and will take you to Myself
 so that where I am
 there you also will be.","And you know the way where I am going.\u201d","Jesus *said to him
 \u201cI am the way
 and the truth
 and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me.","If you had known Me
 you would have known My Father also; from now on you know Him
 and have seen Him.\u201d","Jesus *said to him
 \u201cHave I been with you for so long a time
 and yet you have not come to know Me
 Philip? The one who has seen Me has seen the Father; how can you say
 \u2018Show us the Father\u2019?","Do you not believe that I am in the Father
 and the Father is in Me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on My own
 but the Father
 as He remains in Me
 does His works.","Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me; otherwise believe because of the works themselves.","Truly
 truly I say to you
 the one who believes in Me
 the works that I do
 he will do also; and greater works than these he will do; because I am going to the Father.","And whatever you ask in My name
 this I will do
 so that the Father may be glorified in the Son.","If you ask Me anything in My name
 I will do it.","\u201cIf you love Me
 you will keep My commandments.","I will ask the Father
 and He will give you another Helper
 so that He may be with you forever;","the Helper is the Spirit of truth
 whom the world cannot receive
 because it does not see Him or know Him; but you know Him because He remains with you and will be in you.","\u201cI will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you.","After a little while
 the world no longer is going to see Me
 but you are going to see Me; because I live
 you also will live.","On that day you will know that I am in My Father
 and you are in Me
 and I in you.","The one who has My commandments and keeps them is the one who loves Me; and the one who loves Me will be loved by My Father
 and I will love him and will reveal Myself to him.\u201d","Judas (not Iscariot) *said to Him
 \u201cLord
 what has happened that You are going to reveal Yourself to us and not to the world?\u201d","Jesus answered and said to him
 \u201cIf anyone loves Me
 he will follow My word; and My Father will love him
 and We will come to him and make Our dwelling with him.","The one who does not love Me does not follow My words; and the word which you hear is not Mine
 but the Father\u2019s who sent Me.","\u201cThese things I have spoken to you while remaining with you.","But the Helper
 the Holy Spirit whom the Father will send in My name
 He will teach you all things
 and remind you of all that I said to you.","Peace I leave you
 My peace I give you; not as the world gives
 do I give to you. Do not let your hearts be troubled
 nor fearful.","You heard that I said to you
 \u2018I am going away
 and I am coming to you.\u2019 If you loved Me
 you would have rejoiced because I am going to the Father
 for the Father is greater than I.","And now I have told you before it happens
 so that when it happens
 you may believe.","I will not speak much more with you
 for the ruler of the world is coming
 and he has nothing in regard to Me
","but so that the world may know that I love the Father
 I do exactly as the Father commanded Me. Get up
 let\u2019s go from here.","\u201cI am the true vine
 and My Father is the vinedresser.","Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit
 He takes away; and every branch that bears fruit
 He prunes it so that it may bear more fruit.","You are already clean because of the word which I have spoken to you.","Remain in Me
 and I in you. Just as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself but must remain in the vine
 so neither can you unless you remain in Me.","I am the vine
 you are the branches; the one who remains in Me
 and I in him bears much fruit
 for apart from Me you can do nothing.","If anyone does not remain in Me
 he is thrown away like a branch and dries up; and they gather them and throw them into the fire
 and they are burned.","If you remain in Me
 and My words remain in you
 ask whatever you wish
 and it will be done for you.","My Father is glorified by this
 that you bear much fruit
 and so prove to be My disciples.","Just as the Father has loved Me
 I also have loved you; remain in My love.","If you keep My commandments
 you will remain in My love; just as I have kept My Father\u2019s commandments and remain in His love.","These things I have spoken to you so that My joy may be in you
 and that your joy may be made full.","\u201cThis is My commandment
 that you love one another
 just as I have loved you.","Greater love has no one than this
 that a person will lay down his life for his friends.","You are My friends if you do what I command you.","No longer do I call you slaves
 for the slave does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends
 because all things that I have heard from My Father I have made known to you.","You did not choose Me but I chose you
 and appointed you that you would go and bear fruit
 and that your fruit would remain
 so that whatever you ask of the Father in My name He may give to you.","This I command you
 that you love one another.","\u201cIf the world hates you
 you know that it has hated Me before it hated you.","If you were of the world
 the world would love you as its own; but because you are not of the world
 but I chose you out of the world
 because of this the world hates you.","Remember the word that I said to you
 \u2018A slave is not greater than his master.\u2019 If they persecuted Me
 they will persecute you as well; if they followed My word
 they will follow yours also.","But all these things they will do to you on account of My name
 because they do not know the One who sent Me.","If I had not come and spoken to them
 they would not have sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.","The one who hates Me hates My Father also.","If I had not done among them the works which no one else did
 they would not have sin; but now they have both seen and hated Me and My Father as well.","But this has happened so that the word that is written in their Law will be fulfilled: \u2018They hated Me for no reason.\u2019","\u201cWhen the Helper comes
 whom I will send to you from the Father
 namely
 the Spirit of truth who comes from the Father
 He will testify about Me
","and you are testifying as well
 because you have been with Me from the beginning.","\u201cThese things I have spoken to you so that you will not be led into sin.","They will ban you from the synagogue
 yet an hour is coming for everyone who kills you to think that he is offering a service to God.","These things they will do because they have not known the Father nor Me.","But these things I have spoken to you
 so that when their hour comes
 you may remember that I told you of them. However
 I did not say these things to you at the beginning
 because I was with you.","\u201cBut now I am going to Him who sent Me; and none of you asks Me
 \u2018Where are You going?\u2019","But because I have said these things to you
 grief has filled your heart.","But I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I am leaving; for if I do not leave
 the Helper will not come to you; but if I go
 I will send Him to you.","And He
 when He comes
 will convict the world regarding sin
 and righteousness
 and judgment:","regarding sin
 because they do not believe in Me;","and regarding righteousness
 because I am going to the Father and you no longer are going to see Me;","and regarding judgment
 because the ruler of this world has been judged.","\u201cI have many more things to say to you
 but you cannot bear them at the present time.","But when He
 the Spirit of truth
 comes
 He will guide you into all the truth; for He will not speak on His own
 but whatever He hears
 He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come.","He will glorify Me
 for He will take from Mine and will disclose it to you.","All things that the Father has are Mine; this is why I said that He takes from Mine and will disclose it to you.","\u201cA little while
 and you no longer are going to see Me; and again a little while
 and you will see Me.\u201d","So some of His disciples said to one another
 \u201cWhat is this that He is telling us
 \u2018A little while
 and you are not going to see Me; and again a little while
 and you will see Me\u2019; and
 \u2018because I am going to the Father\u2019?\u201d","So they were saying
 \u201cWhat is this that He says
 \u2018A little while\u2019? We do not know what He is talking about.\u201d","Jesus knew that they wanted to question Him
 and He said to them
 \u201cAre you deliberating together about this
 that I said
 \u2018A little while
 and you are not going to see Me
 and again a little while
 and you will see Me\u2019?","Truly
 truly I say to you that you will weep and mourn
 but the world will rejoice; you will grieve
 but your grief will be turned into joy!","Whenever a woman is in labor she has pain
 because her hour has come; but when she gives birth to the child
 she no longer remembers the anguish because of the joy that a child has been born into the world.","Therefore you too have grief now; but I will see you again
 and your heart will rejoice
 and no one is going to take your joy away from you.","And on that day you will not question Me about anything. Truly
 truly I say to you
 if you ask the Father for anything in My name
 He will give it to you.","Until now you have asked for nothing in My name; ask and you will receive
 so that your joy may be made full.","\u201cThese things I have spoken to you in figures of speech; an hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figures of speech
 but will tell you plainly about the Father.","On that day you will ask in My name
 and I am not saying to you that I will request of the Father on your behalf;","for the Father Himself loves you
 because you have loved Me and have believed that I came forth from the Father.","I came forth from the Father and have come into the world; again
 I am leaving the world and going to the Father.\u201d","Jesus replied to them
 \u201cDo you now believe?","Behold
 an hour is coming
 and has already come
 for you to be scattered
 each to his own home
 and to leave Me alone; and yet I am not alone
 because the Father is with Me.","These things I have spoken to you so that in Me you may have peace. In the world you have tribulation
 but take courage; I have overcome the world.\u201d","Jesus spoke these things; and raising His eyes to heaven
 He said
 \u201cFather
 the hour has come; glorify Your Son
 so that the Son may glorify You
","just as You gave Him authority over all mankind
 so that to all whom You have given Him
 He may give eternal life.","And this is eternal life
 that they may know You
 the only true God
 and Jesus Christ whom You have sent.","I glorified You on the earth by accomplishing the work which You have given Me to do.","And now You
 Father
 glorify Me together with Yourself
 with the glory which I had with You before the world existed.","\u201cI have revealed Your name to the men whom You gave Me out of the world; they were Yours and You gave them to Me
 and they have followed Your word.","Now they have come to know that everything which You have given Me is from You;","for the words which You gave Me I have given to them; and they received them and truly understood that I came forth from You
 and they believed that You sent Me.","I ask on their behalf; I do not ask on behalf of the world
 but on the behalf of those whom You have given Me
 because they are Yours;","and all things that are Mine are Yours
 and Yours are Mine; and I have been glorified in them.","I am no longer going to be in the world; and yet they themselves are in the world
 and I am coming to You. Holy Father
 keep them in Your name
 the name which You have given Me
 so that they may be one just as We are.","While I was with them
 I was keeping them in Your name
 which You have given Me; and I guarded them
 and not one of them perished except the son of destruction
 so that the Scripture would be fulfilled.","But now I am coming to You; and these things I speak in the world so that they may have My joy made full in themselves.","I have given them Your word; and the world has hated them because they are not of the world
 just as I am not of the world.","I am not asking You to take them out of the world
 but to keep them away from the evil one.","They are not of the world
 just as I am not of the world.","Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth.","Just as You sent Me into the world
 I also sent them into the world.","And for their sakes I sanctify Myself
 so that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth.","\u201cI am not asking on behalf of these alone
 but also for those who believe in Me through their word
","that they may all be one; just as You
 Father
 are in Me and I in You
 that they also may be in Us
 so that the world may believe that You sent Me.","The glory which You have given Me I also have given to them
 so that they may be one
 just as We are one;","I in them and You in Me
 that they may be perfected in unity
 so that the world may know that You sent Me
 and You loved them
 just as You loved Me.","Father
 I desire that they also
 whom You have given Me
 be with Me where I am
 so that they may see My glory which You have given Me
 for You loved Me before the foundation of the world.","\u201cRighteous Father
 although the world has not known You
 yet I have known You; and these have known that You sent Me;","and I have made Your name known to them
 and will make it known
 so that the love with which You loved Me may be in them
 and I in them.\u201d","Jesus therefore
 knowing all the things that were coming upon Him
 came out into the open and *said to them
 \u201cWhom are you seeking?\u201d","They answered Him
 \u201cJesus the Nazarene.\u201d He *said to them
 \u201cI am He.\u201d And Judas also
 who was betraying Him
 was standing with them.","Now then
 when He said to them
 \u201cI am He
\u201d they drew back and fell to the ground.","He then asked them again
 \u201cWhom are you seeking?\u201d And they said
 \u201cJesus the Nazarene.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cI told you that I am He; so if you are seeking Me
 let these men go on their way.\u201d","So Jesus said to Peter
 \u201cPut the sword into the sheath; the cup which the Father has given Me
 am I not to drink it?\u201d","Then the slave woman who was the doorkeeper *said to Peter
 \u201cYou are not also one of this Man\u2019s disciples
 are you?\u201d He *said
 \u201cI am not.\u201d","Jesus answered him
 \u201cI have spoken openly to the world; I always taught in synagogues and in the temple area
 where all the Jews congregate; and I said nothing in secret.","Why are you asking Me? Ask those who have heard what I spoke to them. Look: these people know what I said.\u201d","Jesus answered him
 \u201cIf I have spoken wrongly
 testify of the wrong; but if rightly
 why do you strike Me?\u201d","So Pilate said to them
 \u201cTake Him yourselves
 and judge Him according to your law.\u201d The Jews said to him
 \u201cWe are not permitted to put anyone to death.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cAre you saying this on your own
 or did others tell you about Me?\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cMy kingdom is not of this world. If My kingdom were of this world
 My servants would be fighting so that I would not be handed over to the Jews; but as it is
 My kingdom is not of this realm.\u201d","Therefore Pilate said to Him
 \u201cSo You are a king?\u201d Jesus answered
 \u201cYou say correctly that I am a king. For this purpose I have been born
 and for this I have come into the world: to testify to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth listens to My voice.\u201d","And then Pilate came out again and *said to them
 \u201cSee
 I am bringing Him out to you so that you will know that I find no grounds at all for charges in His case.\u201d","Jesus then came out
 wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. And Pilate *said to them
 \u201cBehold
 the Man!\u201d","So when the chief priests and the officers saw Him
 they shouted
 saying
 \u201cCrucify
 crucify!\u201d Pilate *said to them
 \u201cTake Him yourselves and crucify Him; for I find no grounds for charges in His case!\u201d","Jesus answered him
 \u201cYou would have no authority over Me at all
 if it had not been given to you from above; for this reason the one who handed Me over to you has the greater sin.\u201d","Now it was the day of preparation for the Passover; it was about the sixth hour. And he *said to the Jews
 \u201cLook
 your King!\u201d","So when Jesus saw His mother
 and the disciple whom He loved standing nearby
 He *said to His mother
 \u201cWoman
 behold
 your son!\u201d","Then He *said to the disciple
 \u201cBehold
 your mother!\u201d And from that hour the disciple took her into his own household.","After this
 Jesus
 knowing that all things had already been accomplished
 in order that the Scripture would be fulfilled
 *said
 \u201cI am thirsty.\u201d","Therefore when Jesus had received the sour wine
 He said
 \u201cIt is finished!\u201d And He bowed His head and gave up His spirit.","So she *ran and *came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved
 and *said to them
 \u201cThey have taken the Lord from the tomb
 and we do not know where they have put Him.\u201d","And they *said to her
 \u201cWoman
 why are you weeping?\u201d She *said to them
 \u201cBecause they have taken away my Lord
 and I do not know where they put Him.\u201d","Jesus *said to her
 \u201cWoman
 why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?\u201d Thinking that He was the gardener
 she *said to Him
 \u201cSir
 if you have carried Him away
 tell me where you put Him
 and I will take Him away.\u201d","Jesus *said to her
 \u201cMary!\u201d She turned and *said to Him in Hebrew
 \u201cRabboni!\u201d (which means
 Teacher).","Jesus *said to her
 \u201cStop clinging to Me

 \u2018I am ascending to My Father and your Father
 and My God and your God.\u2019\u201d","Now when it was evening on that day
 the first day of the week
 and when the doors were shut where the disciples were together due to fear of the Jews
 Jesus came and stood in their midst
 and *said to them
 \u201cPeace be to you.\u201d","So Jesus said to them again
 \u201cPeace be to you; just as the Father has sent Me
 I also send you.\u201d","And when He had said this
 He breathed on them and *said to them
 \u201cReceive the Holy Spirit.","If you forgive the sins of any
 their sins have been forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any
 they have been retained.\u201d","So the other disciples were saying to him
 \u201cWe have seen the Lord!\u201d But he said to them
 \u201cUnless I see in His hands the imprint of the nails
 and put my finger into the place of the nails
 and put my hand into His side
 I will not believe.\u201d","Eight days later His disciples were again inside
 and Thomas was with them. Jesus *came

 \u201cPeace be to you.\u201d","Then He *said to Thomas
 \u201cPlace your finger here
 and see My hands; and take your hand and put it into My side; and do not continue in disbelief

 \u201cBecause you have seen Me
 have you now believed? Blessed are they who did not see

 \u201cChildren
 you do not have any fish to eat

 \u201cNo.\u201d","Jesus *said to them
 \u201cBring some of the fish which you have now caught.\u201d","Jesus *said to them
 \u201cCome and have breakfast.\u201d None of the disciples ventured to inquire of Him
 \u201cWho are You?\u201d knowing that it was the Lord.","Now when they had finished breakfast
 Jesus *said to Simon Peter
 \u201cSimon

 \u201cYes

 \u201cTend My lambs.\u201d","He *said to him again
 a second time
 \u201cSimon

 do you love Me?\u201d He *said to Him
 \u201cYes
 Lord; You know that I love You.\u201d He *said to him
 \u201cShepherd My sheep.\u201d","He *said to him the third time
 \u201cSimon
 son of John
 do you love Me?\u201d Peter was hurt because He said to him the third time
 \u201cDo you love Me?\u201d And he said to Him
 \u201cLord
 You know all things; You know that I love You.\u201d Jesus *said to him
 \u201cTend My sheep.","Truly
 truly I tell you
 when you were younger
 you used to put on your belt and walk wherever you wanted; but when you grow old
 you will stretch out your hands and someone else will put your belt on you
 and bring you where you do not want to go.\u201d","Now He said this
 indicating by what kind of death he would glorify God. And when He had said this
 He *said to him
 \u201cFollow Me!\u201d","Jesus *said to him
 \u201cIf I want him to remain until I come
 what is that to you? You follow Me!\u201d","Therefore this account went out among the brothers
 that that disciple would not die; yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die

 \u201cIf I want him to remain until I come

 \u201cThen who are you? Are you Elijah?\u201d He answered
 \u201cNo
 I am not.\u201d \u201cAre you the Prophet?\u201d they asked. He answered
 \u201cNo.\u201d","Then they said
 \u201cWho are you? Give us an answer to tell those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?\u201d","John told them in the words of the prophet Isaiah: \u201cI am the voice of one calling out in the desert: \u2018Make the road straight for the Lord.\u2019\u201d Isaiah 40:3","When Jesus turned and saw them following him
 he asked
 \u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d They said
 \u201cRabbi
 where are you staying?\u201d (\u201cRabbi\u201d means \u201cTeacher.\u201d)","He answered
 \u201cCome and see.\u201d So the two men went with Jesus and saw where he was staying and stayed there with him that day. It was about four o\u2019clock in the afternoon.","Then Andrew took Simon to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said
 \u201cYou are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas.\u201d (\u201cCephas\u201d means \u201cPeter.\u201d)","The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee. He found Philip and said to him
 \u201cFollow me.\u201d","Philip found Nathanael and told him
 \u201cWe have found the man that Moses wrote about in the law

 \u201cCan anything good come from Nazareth?\u201d Philip answered
 \u201cCome and see.\u201d","As Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him

 \u201cHow do you know me?\u201d Jesus answered
 \u201cI saw you when you were under the fig tree

 \u201cDo you believe simply because I told you I saw you under the fig tree? You will see greater things than that.\u201d ","And Jesus said to them

 the Son of Man must also be lifted up. ","So that everyone who believes can have eternal life in him.","\u201cGod loved the world so much that he gave his one and only Son so that whoever believes in him may not be lost
 but have eternal life. ","God did not send his Son into the world to judge the world guilty

 \u201cSir
 give me this water so I will never be thirsty again and will not have to come back here to get more water.\u201d","Jesus told her
 \u201cGo get your husband and come back here.\u201d","The woman answered
 \u201cI have no husband.\u201d Jesus said to her
 \u201cYou are right to say you have no husband. ","Really you have had five husbands
 and the man you live with now is not your husband. You told the truth.\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cBelieve me
 woman. The time is coming when neither in Jerusalem nor on this mountain will you actually worship the Father. ","You Samaritans worship something you don\u2019t understand. We understand what we worship
 because salvation comes from the Jews. ","The time is coming when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth

 the Father too is actively seeking such people to worship him. ","God is spirit
 and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.\u201d","Then Jesus said
 \u201cI am he\u2014I
 the one talking to you.\u201d","But Jesus answered
 \u201cI have food to eat that you know nothing about.\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cMy food is to do what the One who sent me wants me to do and to finish his work. ","You have a saying
 \u2018Four more months till harvest.\u2019 But I tell you
 open your eyes and look at the fields ready for harvest now. ","Already
 the one who harvests is being paid and is gathering crops for eternal life. So the one who plants and the one who harvests celebrate at the same time. ","Here the saying is true
 \u2018One person plants
 and another harvests.\u2019 ","I sent you to harvest a crop that you did not work on. Others did the work
 and you get to finish up their work.\u201d","They said to the woman

 \u201cDo you want to be well?\u201d","Then Jesus said
 \u201cStand up. Pick up your mat and walk.\u201d ","But he answered
 \u201cThe man who made me well told me
 \u2018Pick up your mat and walk.\u2019 \u201d","Later
 Jesus found the man at the Temple and said to him
 \u201cSee
 you are well now. Stop sinning so that something worse does not happen to you.\u201d","But Jesus said to them
 \u201cMy Father never stops working
 and so I keep working
 too.\u201d","But Jesus said
 \u201cI tell you the truth
 the Son can do nothing alone. The Son does only what he sees the Father doing
 because the Son does whatever the Father does. ","The Father loves the Son and shows the Son all the things he himself does. But the Father will show the Son even greater things than this so that you can all be amazed.","Just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life
 so also the Son gives life to those he wants to. ","In fact
 the Father judges no one
 but he has given the Son power to do all the judging ","so that all people will honor the Son as much as they honor the Father. Anyone who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.","\u201cI tell you the truth
 whoever hears what I say and believes in the One who sent me has eternal life. That person will not be judged guilty but has already left death and entered life. ","I tell you the truth
 the time is coming and is already here when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God
 and those who hear will have life. ","Life comes from the Father himself
 and he has allowed the Son to have life in himself as well. ","And the Father has given the Son the approval to judge
 because he is the Son of Man. ","Don\u2019t be surprised at this: A time is coming when all who are dead and in their graves will hear his voice.","Then they will come out of their graves. Those who did good will rise and have life forever
 but those who did evil will rise to be judged guilty.","\u201cI can do nothing alone. I judge only the way I am told
 so my judgment is fair. I don\u2019t try to please myself
 but I try to please the One who sent me.","\u201cIf only I tell people about myself
 what I say is not true. ","But there is another who tells about me
 and I know that the things he says about me are true.","\u201cYou have sent people to John
 and he has told you the truth. ","It is not that I need what humans say; I tell you this so you can be saved.","John was like a burning and shining lamp
 and you were happy to enjoy his light for a while.","\u201cBut I have a proof about myself that is greater than that of John. The things I do
 which are the things my Father gave me to do
 prove that the Father sent me. ","And the Father himself who sent me has given proof about me. You have never heard his voice or seen what he looks like.","His teaching does not live in you
 because you don\u2019t believe in the One the Father sent. ","You carefully study the Scriptures because you think they give you eternal life. They do in fact tell about me
 ","but you refuse to come to me to have that life.","\u201cI don\u2019t need praise from people.","But I know you\u2014I know that you don\u2019t have God\u2019s love in you.","I have come from my Father and speak for him
 but you don\u2019t accept me. But when another person comes
 speaking only for himself
 you will accept him. ","You try to get praise from each other
 but you do not try to get the praise that comes from the only God. So how can you believe? ","Don\u2019t think that I will stand before the Father and say you are wrong. The one who says you are wrong is Moses
 the one you hoped would save you. ","If you really believed Moses
 you would believe me
 because Moses wrote about me. ","But if you don\u2019t believe what Moses wrote
 how can you believe what I say?\u201d","When Jesus looked up and saw a large crowd coming toward him
 he said to Philip
 \u201cWhere can we buy enough bread for all these people to eat?\u201d ","Jesus said
 \u201cTell the people to sit down.\u201d There was plenty of grass there
 and about five thousand men sat down there. ","When they had all had enough to eat
 Jesus said to his followers
 \u201cGather the leftover pieces of fish and bread so that nothing is wasted.\u201d ","but Jesus said to them
 \u201cIt is I. Do not be afraid.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cI tell you the truth
 you aren\u2019t looking for me because you saw me do miracles. You are looking for me because you ate the bread and were satisfied. ","Don\u2019t work for the food that spoils. Work for the food that stays good always and gives eternal life. The Son of Man will give you this food
 because on him God the Father has put his power.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cThe work God wants you to do is this: Believe the One he sent.\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cI tell you the truth
 it was not Moses who gave you bread from heaven; it is my Father who is giving you the true bread from heaven. ","God\u2019s bread is the One who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.\u201d","Then Jesus said
 \u201cI am the bread that gives life. Whoever comes to me will never be hungry
 and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty. ","But as I told you before
 you have seen me and still don\u2019t believe. ","The Father gives me the people who are mine. Every one of them will come to me
 and I will always accept them. ","I came down from heaven to do what God wants me to do
 not what I want to do. ","Here is what the One who sent me wants me to do: I must not lose even one whom God gave me
 but I must raise them all on the last day. ","Those who see the Son and believe in him have eternal life
 and I will raise them on the last day. This is what my Father wants.\u201d","But Jesus answered
 \u201cStop complaining to each other. ","The Father is the One who sent me. No one can come to me unless the Father draws him to me
 and I will raise that person up on the last day. ","It is written in the prophets
 \u2018They will all be taught by God.\u2019 Everyone who listens to the Father and learns from him comes to me. ","No one has seen the Father except the One who is from God; only he has seen the Father.","I tell you the truth
 whoever believes has eternal life. ","I am the bread that gives life.","Your ancestors ate the manna in the desert
 but still they died. ","Here is the bread that comes down from heaven. Anyone who eats this bread will never die.","I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Anyone who eats this bread will live forever. This bread is my flesh

 \u201cI tell you the truth
 you must eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood. Otherwise
 you won\u2019t have real life in you. ","Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood have eternal life
 and I will raise them up on the last day. ","My flesh is true food
 and my blood is true drink. ","Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood live in me
 and I live in them. ","The living Father sent me
 and I live because of the Father. So whoever eats me will live because of me. ","I am not like the bread your ancestors ate. They ate that bread and still died. I am the bread that came down from heaven
 and whoever eats this bread will live forever.\u201d ","Knowing that his followers were complaining about this
 Jesus said
 \u201cDoes this teaching bother you? ","Then will it also bother you to see the Son of Man going back to the place where he came from?","It is the Spirit that gives life. The flesh doesn\u2019t give life. The words I told you are spirit
 and they give life. ","But some of you don\u2019t believe.\u201d (Jesus knew from the beginning who did not believe and who would turn against him.)","Jesus said
 \u201cThat is the reason I said
 \u2018If the Father does not bring a person to me
 that one cannot come.\u2019\u201d","Jesus asked the twelve followers
 \u201cDo you want to leave
 too?\u201d","Then Jesus answered
 \u201cI chose all twelve of you
 but one of you is a devil.\u201d","So Jesus\u2019 brothers said to him
 \u201cYou should leave here and go to Judea so your followers there can see the miracles you do. ","Jesus said to his brothers
 \u201cThe right time for me has not yet come
 but any time is right for you. ","The world cannot hate you
 but it hates me
 because I tell it the evil things it does. ","So you go to the feast. I will not go yet to this feast
 because the right time for me has not yet come.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cThe things I teach are not my own
 but they come from him who sent me. ","If people choose to do what God wants
 they will know that my teaching comes from God and not from me. ","Those who teach their own ideas are trying to get honor for themselves. But those who try to bring honor to the one who sent them speak the truth

 but none of you obeys that law. Why are you trying to kill me?\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cI did one miracle
 and you are all amazed. ","Moses gave you the law about circumcision. (But really Moses did not give you circumcision; it came from our ancestors.) And yet you circumcise a baby boy on a Sabbath day.","If a baby boy can be circumcised on a Sabbath day to obey the law of Moses
 why are you angry at me for healing a person\u2019s whole body on the Sabbath day? ","Stop judging by the way things look
 but judge by what is really right.\u201d","Then some of the people who lived in Jerusalem said
 \u201cThis is the man they are trying to kill. ","Jesus
 teaching in the Temple
 cried out
 \u201cYes

 whom you don\u2019t know. ","But I know him
 because I am from him

 \u201cI will be with you a little while longer. Then I will go back to the One who sent me. ","You will look for me
 but you will not find me. And you cannot come where I am.\u201d","Some people said to each other
 \u201cWhere will this man go so we cannot find him? Will he go to the Greek cities where our people live and teach the Greek people there? ","On the last and most important day of the feast Jesus stood up and said in a loud voice
 \u201cLet anyone who is thirsty come to me and drink. ","If anyone believes in me
 rivers of living water will flow out from that person\u2019s heart

 because Jesus had not yet been raised to glory. But later
 those who believed in Jesus would receive the Spirit.","They said to Jesus
 \u201cTeacher
 this woman was caught having sexual relations with a man who is not her husband. ","When they continued to ask Jesus their question
 he raised up and said
 \u201cAnyone here who has never sinned can throw the first stone at her.\u201d ","Jesus raised up again and asked her
 \u201cWoman
 where are they? Has no one judged you guilty?\u201d","She answered
 \u201cNo one
 sir.\u201d Then Jesus said
 \u201cI also don\u2019t judge you guilty. You may go now
 but don\u2019t sin anymore.\u201d]","Later
 Jesus talked to the people again
 saying
 \u201cI am the light of the world. The person who follows me will never live in darkness but will have the light that gives life.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cYes
 I am saying these things about myself
 but they are true. I know where I came from and where I am going. But you don\u2019t know where I came from or where I am going. ","You judge by human standards. I am not judging anyone.","But when I do judge
 I judge truthfully
 because I am not alone. The Father who sent me is with me. ","Your own law says that when two witnesses say the same thing
 you must accept what they say. ","I am one of the witnesses who speaks about myself
 and the Father who sent me is the other witness.\u201d","They asked
 \u201cWhere is your father?\u201d Jesus answered
 \u201cYou don\u2019t know me or my Father. If you knew me
 you would know my Father
 too.\u201d ","Again
 Jesus said to the people
 \u201cI will leave you
 and you will look for me

 \u201cYou people are from here below
 but I am from above. You belong to this world

 you will die in your sins if you don\u2019t believe that I am he.\u201d","They asked
 \u201cThen who are you?\u201d Jesus answered
 \u201cI am what I have told you from the beginning. ","I have many things to say and decide about you. But I tell people only the things I have heard from the One who sent me

 \u201cWhen you lift up the Son of Man
 you will know that I am he. You will know that these things I do are not by my own authority but that I say only what the Father has taught me. ","The One who sent me is with me. I always do what is pleasing to him
 so he has not left me alone.\u201d ","So Jesus said to the Jews who believed in him
 \u201cIf you continue to obey my teaching
 you are truly my followers. ","Then you will know the truth
 and the truth will make you free.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cI tell you the truth
 everyone who lives in sin is a slave to sin. ","A slave does not stay with a family forever
 but a son belongs to the family forever. ","So if the Son makes you free
 you will be truly free. ","I know you are Abraham\u2019s children

 \u201cOur father is Abraham.\u201d Jesus said
 \u201cIf you were really Abraham\u2019s children
 you would do the things Abraham did. ","I am a man who has told you the truth which I heard from God
 but you are trying to kill me. Abraham did nothing like that. ","So you are doing the things your own father did.\u201d But they said
 \u201cWe are not like children who never knew who their father was. God is our Father; he is the only Father we have.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cIf God were really your Father
 you would love me
 because I came from God and now I am here. I did not come by my own authority; God sent me. ","You don\u2019t understand what I say
 because you cannot accept my teaching. ","You belong to your father the devil
 and you want to do what he wants. He was a murderer from the beginning and was against the truth

 he shows what he is really like
 because he is a liar and the father of lies. ","But because I speak the truth
 you don\u2019t believe me. ","Can any of you prove that I am guilty of sin? If I am telling the truth
 why don\u2019t you believe me? ","The person who belongs to God accepts what God says. But you don\u2019t accept what God says
 because you don\u2019t belong to God.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cI have no demon in me. I give honor to my Father
 but you dishonor me. ","I am not trying to get honor for myself. There is One who wants this honor for me
 and he is the judge. ","I tell you the truth
 whoever obeys my teaching will never die.\u201d","They said to Jesus
 \u201cNow we know that you have a demon in you! Even Abraham and the prophets died. But you say
 \u2018Whoever obeys my teaching will never die.\u2019 ","Jesus answered
 \u201cIf I give honor to myself
 that honor is worth nothing. The One who gives me honor is my Father

 but I know him. If I said I did not know him
 I would be a liar like you. But I do know him
 and I obey what he says. ","Your father Abraham was very happy that he would see my day. He saw that day and was glad.\u201d","Jesus answered

 before Abraham was even born

 \u201cWhere is this man?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know
\u201d he answered.","So for the second time
 they called the man who had been blind. They said
 \u201cYou should give God the glory by telling the truth. We know that this man is a sinner.\u201d","He answered
 \u201cI don\u2019t know if he is a sinner. One thing I do know: I was blind
 and now I see.\u201d","They asked
 \u201cWhat did he do to you? How did he make you see again?\u201d","He answered
 \u201cI already told you
 and you didn\u2019t listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his followers
 too?\u201d","When Jesus heard that they had thrown him out
 Jesus found him and said
 \u201cDo you believe in the Son of Man?\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cYou have seen him. The Son of Man is the one talking with you.\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cI came into this world so that the world could be judged. I came so that the blind would see and so that those who see will become blind.\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cIf you were blind
 you would not be guilty of sin. But since you keep saying you see
 your guilt remains.\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cI tell you the truth
 the person who does not enter the sheepfold by the door
 but climbs in some other way
 is a thief and a robber. ","The one who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.","The one who guards the door opens it for him. And the sheep listen to the voice of the shepherd. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.","When he brings all his sheep out
 he goes ahead of them
 and they follow him because they know his voice. ","But they will never follow a stranger. They will run away from him because they don\u2019t know his voice.\u201d","So Jesus said again
 \u201cI tell you the truth
 I am the door for the sheep. ","All the people who came before me were thieves and robbers. The sheep did not listen to them.","I am the door
 and the person who enters through me will be saved and will be able to come in and go out and find pasture. ","A thief comes to steal and kill and destroy
 but I came to give life\u2014life in all its fullness.","\u201cI am the good shepherd. The good shepherd gives his life for the sheep.","The worker who is paid to keep the sheep is different from the shepherd who owns them. When the worker sees a wolf coming
 he runs away and leaves the sheep alone. Then the wolf attacks the sheep and scatters them. ","The man runs away because he is only a paid worker and does not really care about the sheep.","\u201cI am the good shepherd. I know my sheep
 and my sheep know me
 ","just as the Father knows me
 and I know the Father. I give my life for the sheep. ","I have other sheep that are not in this flock
 and I must bring them also. They will listen to my voice
 and there will be one flock and one shepherd. ","The Father loves me because I give my life so that I can take it back again.","No one takes it away from me; I give my own life freely. I have the right to give my life
 and I have the right to take it back. This is what my Father commanded me to do.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cI told you already
 but you did not believe. The miracles I do in my Father\u2019s name show who I am. ","But you don\u2019t believe
 because you are not my sheep. ","My sheep listen to my voice; I know them
 and they follow me. ","I give them eternal life
 and they will never die
 and no one can steal them out of my hand. ","My Father gave my sheep to me. He is greater than all
 and no person can steal my sheep out of my Father\u2019s hand. ","The Father and I are one.\u201d","But he said to them
 \u201cI have done many good works from the Father. Which of these good works are you killing me for?\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cIt is written in your law that God said
 \u2018I said
 you are gods.\u2019 ","This Scripture called those people gods who received God\u2019s message
 and Scripture is always true. ","So why do you say that I speak against God because I said
 \u2018I am God\u2019s Son\u2019? I am the one God chose and sent into the world. ","If I don\u2019t do what my Father does
 then don\u2019t believe me. ","But if I do what my Father does
 even though you don\u2019t believe in me
 believe what I do. Then you will know and understand that the Father is in me and I am in the Father.\u201d","When Jesus heard this
 he said
 \u201cThis sickness will not end in death. It is for the glory of God
 to bring glory to the Son of God.\u201d ","Then Jesus said to his followers
 \u201cLet\u2019s go back to Judea.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cAre there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the daylight
 he will not stumble
 because he can see by this world\u2019s light. ","But if anyone walks at night
 he stumbles because there is no light to help him see.\u201d","After Jesus said this
 he added
 \u201cOur friend Lazarus has fallen asleep
 but I am going there to wake him.\u201d","So then Jesus said plainly
 \u201cLazarus is dead. ","And I am glad for your sakes I was not there so that you may believe. But let\u2019s go to him now.\u201d","Then Thomas (the one called Didymus) said to the other followers
 \u201cLet us also go so that we can die with him.\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cYour brother will rise and live again.\u201d","Jesus said to her
 \u201cI am the resurrection and the life. Those who believe in me will have life even if they die. ","And everyone who lives and believes in me will never die. Martha
 do you believe this?\u201d","Martha answered
 \u201cYes
 Lord. I believe that you are the Christ
 the Son of God
 the One coming to the world.\u201d","But Mary went to the place where Jesus was. When she saw him
 she fell at his feet and said
 \u201cLord
 if you had been here
 my brother would not have died.\u201d","He asked
 \u201cWhere did you bury him?\u201d \u201cCome and see
 Lord
\u201d they said.","Jesus said
 \u201cMove the stone away.\u201d Martha
 the sister of the dead man
 said
 \u201cBut
 Lord
 it has been four days since he died. There will be a bad smell.\u201d","Then Jesus said to her
 \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you that if you believed you would see the glory of God?\u201d","So they moved the stone away from the entrance. Then Jesus looked up and said
 \u201cFather
 I thank you that you heard me. ","I know that you always hear me
 but I said these things because of the people here around me. I want them to believe that you sent me.\u201d ","After Jesus said this
 he cried out in a loud voice
 \u201cLazarus
 come out!\u201d ","The dead man came out
 his hands and feet wrapped with pieces of cloth
 and a cloth around his face. Jesus said to them
 \u201cTake the cloth off of him and let him go.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cLeave her alone. It was right for her to save this perfume for today
 the day for me to be prepared for burial. ","You will always have the poor with you
 but you will not always have me.\u201d","There had been many people with Jesus when he raised Lazarus from the dead and told him to come out of the tomb. Now they were telling others about what Jesus did.","So the Pharisees said to each other
 \u201cYou can see that nothing is going right for us. Look! The whole world is following him.\u201d","They went to Philip
 who was from Bethsaida in Galilee
 and said
 \u201cSir
 we would like to see Jesus.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cThe time has come for the Son of Man to receive his glory. ","I tell you the truth
 a grain of wheat must fall to the ground and die to make many seeds. But if it never dies
 it remains only a single seed. ","Those who love their lives will lose them
 but those who hate their lives in this world will keep true life forever. ","Whoever serves me must follow me. Then my servant will be with me everywhere I am. My Father will honor anyone who serves me.","\u201cNow I am very troubled. Should I say
 \u2018Father
 save me from this time\u2019? No
 I came to this time so I could suffer. ","Father
 bring glory to your name!\u201d Then a voice came from heaven
 \u201cI have brought glory to it
 and I will do it again.\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cThat voice was for your sake
 not mine. ","Now is the time for the world to be judged; now the ruler of this world will be thrown down.","If I am lifted up from the earth
 I will draw all people toward me.\u201d ","Then Jesus said
 \u201cThe light will be with you for a little longer
 so walk while you have the light. Then the darkness will not catch you. If you walk in the darkness
 you will not know where you are going. ","Believe in the light while you still have it so that you will become children of light.\u201d When Jesus had said this
 he left and hid himself from them.","Then Jesus cried out
 \u201cWhoever believes in me is really believing in the One who sent me. ","Whoever sees me sees the One who sent me.","I have come as light into the world so that whoever believes in me would not stay in darkness.","\u201cAnyone who hears my words and does not obey them
 I do not judge
 because I did not come to judge the world
 but to save the world. ","There is a judge for those who refuse to believe in me and do not accept my words. The word I have taught will be their judge on the last day.","The things I taught were not from myself. The Father who sent me told me what to say and what to teach.","And I know that eternal life comes from what the Father commands. So whatever I say is what the Father told me to say.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cYou don\u2019t understand now what I am doing
 but you will understand later.\u201d","Peter said
 \u201cNo
 you will never wash my feet.\u201d Jesus answered
 \u201cIf I don\u2019t wash your feet
 you are not one of my people.\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cAfter a person has had a bath
 his whole body is clean. He needs only to wash his feet. And you men are clean
 but not all of you.\u201d ","Jesus knew who would turn against him
 and that is why he said
 \u201cNot all of you are clean.\u201d","When he had finished washing their feet
 he put on his clothes and sat down again. He asked
 \u201cDo you understand what I have just done for you? ","You call me \u2018Teacher\u2019 and \u2018Lord
\u2019 and you are right
 because that is what I am. ","If I
 your Lord and Teacher
 have washed your feet
 you also should wash each other\u2019s feet. ","I did this as an example so that you should do as I have done for you.","I tell you the truth
 a servant is not greater than his master. A messenger is not greater than the one who sent him. ","If you know these things
 you will be blessed if you do them.","\u201cI am not talking about all of you. I know those I have chosen. But this is to bring about what the Scripture said: \u2018The man who ate at my table has turned against me.\u2019","I am telling you this now before it happens so that when it happens
 you will believe that I am he. ","I tell you the truth
 whoever accepts anyone I send also accepts me. And whoever accepts me also accepts the One who sent me.\u201d","After Jesus said this
 he was very troubled. He said openly
 \u201cI tell you the truth
 one of you will turn against me.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cI will dip this bread into the dish. The man I give it to is the man who will turn against me.\u201d So Jesus took a piece of bread
 dipped it
 and gave it to Judas Iscariot
 the son of Simon. ","As soon as Judas took the bread
 Satan entered him. Jesus said to him
 \u201cThe thing that you will do\u2014do it quickly.\u201d ","When Judas was gone
 Jesus said
 \u201cNow the Son of Man receives his glory
 and God receives glory through him. ","If God receives glory through him
 then God will give glory to the Son through himself. And God will give him glory quickly.\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cMy children
 I will be with you only a little longer. You will look for me
 and what I told the Jews
 I tell you now: Where I am going you cannot come.","\u201cI give you a new command: Love each other. You must love each other as I have loved you.","All people will know that you are my followers if you love each other.\u201d","Simon Peter asked Jesus
 \u201cLord
 where are you going?\u201d Jesus answered
 \u201cWhere I am going you cannot follow now
 but you will follow later.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cAre you ready to die for me? I tell you the truth
 before the rooster crows
 you will say three times that you don\u2019t know me.\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cDon\u2019t let your hearts be troubled. Trust in God
 and trust in me. ","There are many rooms in my Father\u2019s house; I would not tell you this if it were not true. I am going there to prepare a place for you.","After I go and prepare a place for you
 I will come back and take you to be with me so that you may be where I am. ","You know the way to the place where I am going.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cI am the way
 and the truth
 and the life. The only way to the Father is through me. ","If you really knew me
 you would know my Father
 too. But now you do know him
 and you have seen him.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cI have been with you a long time now. Do you still not know me
 Philip? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father. So why do you say
 \u2018Show us the Father\u2019? ","Don\u2019t you believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words I say to you don\u2019t come from me
 but the Father lives in me and does his own work. ","Believe me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in me. Or believe because of the miracles I have done.","I tell you the truth
 whoever believes in me will do the same things that I do. Those who believe will do even greater things than these

 I will do it for you so that the Father\u2019s glory will be shown through the Son. ","If you ask me for anything in my name
 I will do it.","\u201cIf you love me
 you will obey my commands. ","I will ask the Father

 because it does not see him or know him. But you know him
 because he lives with you and he will be in you.","\u201cI will not leave you all alone like orphans; I will come back to you.","In a little while the world will not see me anymore

 you will live

 \u201cBut
 Lord
 why do you plan to show yourself to us and not to the rest of the world?\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cIf people love me
 they will obey my teaching. My Father will love them

So don\u2019t let your hearts be troubled or afraid.","You heard me say to you
 \u2018I am going
 but I am coming back to you.\u2019 If you loved me
 you should be happy that I am going back to the Father
 because he is greater than I am. ","I have told you this now
 before it happens
 so that when it happens
 you will believe. ","I will not talk with you much longer
 because the ruler of this world is coming. He has no power over me
 ","but the world must know that I love the Father
 so I do exactly what the Father told me to do. \u201cCome now

And he trims and cleans every branch that produces fruit so that it will produce even more fruit.","You are already clean because of the words I have spoken to you.","Remain in me
 and I will remain in you. A branch cannot produce fruit alone but must remain in the vine. In the same way
 you cannot produce fruit alone but must remain in me.","\u201cI am the vine
 and you are the branches. If any remain in me and I remain in them
 they produce much fruit. But without me they can do nothing. ","If any do not remain in me
 they are like a branch that is thrown away and then dies. People pick up dead branches
 throw them into the fire
 and burn them. ","If you remain in me and follow my teachings
 you can ask anything you want

 fruit that will last. Then the Father will give you anything you ask for in my name. ","This is my command: Love each other.","\u201cIf the world hates you
 remember that it hated me first. ","If you belonged to the world

 they will do wrong to you

 they will obey yours
 too. ","They will do all this to you on account of me

 \u2018Where are you going?\u2019 ","Your hearts are filled with sadness because I have told you these things.","But I tell you the truth
 it is better for you that I go away. When I go away
 I will send the Helper to you. If I do not go away
 the Helper will not come. ","When the Helper comes
 he will prove to the people of the world the truth about sin
 about being right with God
 and about judgment. ","He will prove to them that sin is not believing in me.","He will prove to them that being right with God comes from my going to the Father and not being seen anymore.","And the Helper will prove to them that judgment happened when the ruler of this world was judged.","\u201cI have many more things to say to you

 he will lead you into all truth. He will not speak his own words

 \u2018Because I am going to the Father\u2019?\u201d ","They also asked
 \u201cWhat does he mean by \u2018a little while\u2019? We don\u2019t understand what he is saying.\u201d","Jesus saw that the followers wanted to ask him about this

 I will not need to ask the Father for you. ","The Father himself loves you. He loves you because you loved me and believed that I came from God.","I came from the Father into the world. Now I am leaving the world and going back to the Father.\u201d","Jesus answered

 \u201cMy kingdom does not belong to this world. If it belonged to this world
 my servants would have fought to keep me from being given over to the Jewish leaders. But my kingdom is from another place.\u201d","Pilate said
 \u201cSo you are a king!\u201d Jesus answered

 \u201cWhat I\u2019m about to tell you is true. The Son can do nothing by himself. He can do only what he sees his Father doing. What the Father does

You have never seen what he really looks like.","And his word does not live in you. That\u2019s because you do not believe the one he sent.","You study the Scriptures carefully. You study them because you think they will give you eternal life. The Scriptures you study are a witness about me.","But you refuse to come to me and receive life.","\u201cI do not accept praise from human beings.","But I know you.

 and you will die in your sin. You can\u2019t come where I am going.\u201d","But Jesus said
 \u201cYou are from below. I am from heaven. You are from this world. I am not from this world. ","I told you that you would die in your sins. This will happen if you don\u2019t believe that I am he. If you don\u2019t believe
 you will certainly die in your sins.\u201d","\u201cWho are you?\u201d they asked. \u201cJust what I have been telling you from the beginning
\u201d Jesus replied. ","\u201cI have a lot to say that will judge you. But the one who sent me can be trusted. And I tell the world what I have heard from him.\u201d","So Jesus said
 \u201cYou will lift up the Son of Man. Then you will know that I am he. You will also know that I do nothing on my own. I speak just what the Father has taught me. ","The one who sent me is with me. He has not left me alone
 because I always do what pleases him.\u201d ","Jesus spoke to the Jews who had believed him. \u201cIf you obey my teaching
\u201d he said
 \u201cyou are really my disciples. ","Then you will know the truth. And the truth will set you free.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cWhat I\u2019m about to tell you is true. Everyone who sins is a slave of sin. ","A slave has no lasting place in the family. But a son belongs to the family forever.","So if the Son of Man sets you free
 you will really be free. ","I know that you are Abraham\u2019s children. But you are looking for a way to kill me. You have no room for my word.","I am telling you what I saw when I was with my Father. You are doing what you have heard from your father. \u201d","\u201cAbraham is our father
\u201d they answered. Jesus said
 \u201cAre you really Abraham\u2019s children? If you are
 you will do what Abraham did. ","But you are looking for a way to kill me. I am a man who has told you the truth I heard from God. Abraham didn\u2019t do the things you want to do.","You are doing what your own father does.\u201d \u201cWe have the right to claim to be God\u2019s children
\u201d they objected. \u201cThe only Father we have is God himself.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cIf God were your Father
 you would love me. I have come here from God. I have not come on my own. God sent me. ","Why aren\u2019t my words clear to you? Because you can\u2019t really hear what I say.","You belong to your father
 the devil. You want to obey your father\u2019s wishes. From the beginning
 the devil was a murderer. He has never obeyed the truth. There is no truth in him. When he lies
 he speaks his natural language. He does this because he is a liar. He is the father of lies. ","But because I tell the truth
 you don\u2019t believe me! ","Can any of you prove I am guilty of sinning? Am I not telling the truth? Then why don\u2019t you believe me?","Whoever belongs to God hears what God says. The reason you don\u2019t hear is that you don\u2019t belong to God.\u201d","\u201cI am not controlled by a demon
\u201d said Jesus. \u201cI honor my Father. You do not honor me. ","I am not seeking glory for myself. But there is one who brings glory to me. He is the judge.","What I\u2019m about to tell you is true. Whoever obeys my word will never die.\u201d","Then they cried out
 \u201cNow we know you are controlled by a demon! Abraham died. So did the prophets. But you say that whoever obeys your word will never die. ","Jesus replied
 \u201cIf I bring glory to myself
 my glory means nothing. You claim that my Father is your God. He is the one who brings glory to me. ","You do not know him. But I know him. If I said I did not
 I would be a liar like you. But I do know him. And I obey his word. ","Your father Abraham was filled with joy at the thought of seeing my day. He saw it and was glad.\u201d","\u201cWhat I\u2019m about to tell you is true
\u201d Jesus answered. \u201cBefore Abraham was born
 I am!\u201d ","\u201cIt isn\u2019t because this man sinned
\u201d said Jesus. \u201cIt isn\u2019t because his parents sinned. He was born blind so that God\u2019s power could be shown by what\u2019s going to happen. ","While it is still day
 we must do the works of the one who sent me. Night is coming. Then no one can work. ","While I am in the world
 I am the light of the world.\u201d","\u201cGo
\u201d he told him. \u201cWash in the Pool of Siloam.\u201d Siloam means Sent. So the man went and washed. And he came home able to see.","He replied
 \u201cThe man they call Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes. He told me to go to Siloam and wash. So I went and washed. Then I could see.\u201d","\u201cWhere is this man?\u201d they asked him. \u201cI don\u2019t know
\u201d he said.","Again the Pharisees called the man who had been blind to come to them. \u201cGive glory to God by telling the truth!\u201d they said. \u201cWe know that the man who healed you is a sinner.\u201d","He replied
 \u201cI don\u2019t know if he is a sinner or not. I do know one thing. I was blind
 but now I can see!\u201d","Then they asked him
 \u201cWhat did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?\u201d","He answered
 \u201cI have already told you. But you didn\u2019t listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his disciples too?\u201d","Jesus heard that the Pharisees had thrown the man out of the synagogue. When Jesus found him
 he said
 \u201cDo you believe in the Son of Man?\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cYou have now seen him. In fact
 he is the one speaking with you.\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cI have come into this world to judge it. I have come so that people who are blind will see. I have come so that people who can see will become blind.\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cIf you were blind
 you would not be guilty of sin. But since you claim you can see
 you remain guilty.","\u201cWhat I\u2019m about to tell you Pharisees is true. What if someone does not enter the sheep pen through the gate but climbs in another way? That person is a thief and a robber.","The one who enters through the gate is the shepherd of the sheep.","The gatekeeper opens the gate for him. The sheep listen to his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.","When he has brought out all his own sheep
 he goes on ahead of them. His sheep follow him because they know his voice. ","But they will never follow a stranger. In fact
 they will run away from him. They don\u2019t recognize a stranger\u2019s voice.\u201d ","So Jesus said again
 \u201cWhat I\u2019m about to tell you is true. I am like a gate for the sheep. ","All who have come before me are thieves and robbers. But the sheep have not listened to them.","I\u2019m like a gate. Anyone who enters through me will be saved. They will come in and go out. And they will find plenty of food.","A thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I have come so they may have life. I want them to have it in the fullest possible way.","\u201cI am the good shepherd. The good shepherd gives his life for the sheep.","The hired man is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep. So when the hired man sees the wolf coming
 he leaves the sheep and runs away. Then the wolf attacks the flock and scatters it. ","The man runs away because he is a hired man. He does not care about the sheep.","\u201cI am the good shepherd. I know my sheep
 and my sheep know me. ","They know me just as the Father knows me and I know the Father. And I give my life for the sheep.","I have other sheep that do not belong to this sheep pen. I must bring them in too. They also will listen to my voice. Then there will be one flock and one shepherd.","The reason my Father loves me is that I give up my life. But I will take it back again.","No one takes it from me. I give it up myself. I have the authority to give it up. And I have the authority to take it back again. I received this command from my Father.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cI did tell you. But you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father\u2019s name are a witness for me. ","But you do not believe
 because you are not my sheep. ","My sheep listen to my voice. I know them
 and they follow me. ","I give them eternal life
 and they will never die. No one will steal them out of my hand. ","My Father
 who has given them to me
 is greater than anyone. No one can steal them out of my Father\u2019s hand. ","I and the Father are one.\u201d","But Jesus said to them
 \u201cI have shown you many good works from the Father. Which good work are you throwing stones at me for?\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cDidn\u2019t God say in your Law
 \u2018I have said you are \u201cgods\u201d\u2009\u2019? (Psalm 82:6) ","We know that Scripture is always true. God spoke to some people and called them \u2018gods.\u2019","If that is true
 what about the one the Father set apart as his very own? What about this one the Father sent into the world? Why do you charge me with saying a very evil thing? Is it because I said
 \u2018I am God\u2019s Son\u2019? ","Don\u2019t believe me unless I do the works of my Father.","But what if I do them? Even if you don\u2019t believe me
 believe these works. Then you will know and understand that the Father is in me and I am in the Father.\u201d ","When Jesus heard this
 he said
 \u201cThis sickness will not end in death. No
 it is for God\u2019s glory. God\u2019s Son will receive glory because of it.\u201d ","And then he said to his disciples
 \u201cLet us go back to Judea.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cAren\u2019t there 12 hours of daylight? Anyone who walks during the day won\u2019t trip and fall. They can see because of this world\u2019s light. ","But when they walk at night
 they\u2019ll trip and fall. They have no light.\u201d","After he said this
 Jesus went on speaking to them. \u201cOur friend Lazarus has fallen asleep
\u201d he said. \u201cBut I am going there to wake him up.\u201d","So then he told them plainly
 \u201cLazarus is dead. ","For your benefit
 I am glad I was not there. Now you will believe. But let us go to him.\u201d","Then Thomas
 who was also called Didymus
 spoke to the rest of the disciples. \u201cLet us go also

 \u201cYour brother will rise again.\u201d","Jesus said to her
 \u201cI am the resurrection and the life. Anyone who believes in me will live
 even if they die. ","And whoever lives by believing in me will never die. Do you believe this?\u201d","\u201cYes

 she fell at his feet. She said
 \u201cLord

 \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you that if you believe
 you will see God\u2019s glory?\u201d","So they took away the stone. Then Jesus looked up. He said
 \u201cFather
 I thank you for hearing me. ","I know that you always hear me. But I said this for the benefit of the people standing here. I said it so they will believe that you sent me.\u201d","Then Jesus called in a loud voice. He said
 \u201cLazarus

 \u201cThe time has come for the Son of Man to receive glory. ","What I\u2019m about to tell you is true. Unless a grain of wheat falls to the ground and dies

 it produces many seeds. ","Anyone who loves their life will lose it. But anyone who hates their life in this world will keep it and have eternal life.","Anyone who serves me must follow me. And where I am

 \u201cWhat does he mean by saying

 \u2018I am going to the Father\u2019?\u201d ","They kept asking

 you will see me\u2019? ","What I\u2019m about to tell you is true. You will weep and mourn while the world is full of joy. You will be sad

 she forgets the pain. She forgets because she is so happy that a baby has been born into the world. ","That\u2019s the way it is with you. Now it\u2019s your time to be sad. But I will see you again. Then you will be full of joy. And no one will take away your joy.","When that day comes

 I guarded them. I kept them safe through the name you gave me. None of them has been lost

 \u201cTake him yourselves. Judge him by your own law.\u201d \u201cBut we don\u2019t have the right to put anyone to death

 \u201cMy kingdom is not from this world. If it were

 then!\u201d said Pilate. Jesus answered
 \u201cYou say that I am a king. In fact

 \u201cYou were given power from heaven. If you weren\u2019t

 \u201cMay peace be with you! The Father has sent me. So now I am sending you.\u201d ","He then breathed on them. He said
 \u201cReceive the Holy Spirit. ","If you forgive anyone\u2019s sins
 their sins are forgiven. If you do not forgive them

 \u201cLord
 you know all things. You know that I love you.\u201d Jesus said
 \u201cFeed my sheep. ","What I\u2019m about to tell you is true. When you were younger
 you dressed yourself. You went wherever you wanted to go. But when you are old
 you will stretch out your hands. Someone else will dress you. Someone else will lead you where you do not want to go.\u201d ","Jesus said this to point out how Peter would die. His death would bring glory to God. Then Jesus said to him
 \u201cFollow me!\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cSuppose I want him to remain alive until I return. What does that matter to you? You must follow me.\u201d ","Because of what Jesus said
 a false report spread among the believers. The story was told that the disciple Jesus loved wouldn\u2019t die. But Jesus did not say he would not die. He only said
 \u201cSuppose I want him to remain alive until I return. What does that matter to you?\u201d","They asked him
 \u2018Then who are you? Are you Elijah?\u2019 He said
 \u2018I am not.\u2019 \u2018Are you the Prophet?\u2019 He answered
 \u2018No.\u2019","Finally they said
 \u2018Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?\u2019","John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet
 \u2018I am the voice of one calling in the wilderness

 \u2018You are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas\u2019 (which

 \u2018Follow me.\u2019","Philip found Nathanael and told him

 \u2018I saw you while you were still under the fig-tree before Philip called you.\u2019","Jesus said
 \u2018You believe because I told you I saw you under the fig-tree. You will see greater things than that.\u2019 ","He then added
 \u2018Very truly I tell you
 you will see \u201cheaven open

 why do you involve me?\u2019 Jesus replied. \u2018My hour has not yet come.\u2019","Jesus said to the servants
 \u2018Fill the jars with water\u2019; so they filled them to the brim.","Then he told them

 \u2018Destroy this temple

 \u2018Very truly I tell you
 no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again.\u2019","Jesus answered
 \u2018Very truly I tell you

 so the Son of Man must be lifted up
 ","that everyone who believes may have eternal life in him.\u2019","For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son
 that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. ","For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world
 but to save the world through him. ","Whoever believes in him is not condemned
 but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God\u2019s one and only Son. ","This is the verdict: light has come into the world

 and will not come into the light for fear that their deeds will be exposed. ","But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light

 the Son can do nothing by himself; he can do only what he sees his Father doing

 and he will show him even greater works than these
 so that you will be amazed. ","For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life
 even so the Son gives life to whom he is pleased to give it. ","Moreover
 the Father judges no one
 but has entrusted all judgment to the Son
 ","that all may honour the Son just as they honour the Father. Whoever does not honour the Son does not honour the Father

 whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be judged but has crossed over from death to life. ","Very truly I tell you
 a time is coming and has now come when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who hear will live. ","For as the Father has life in himself
 so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself. ","And he has given him authority to judge because he is the Son of Man.","\u2018Do not be amazed at this
 for a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice ","and come out \u2013 those who have done what is good will rise to live
 and those who have done what is evil will rise to be condemned. ","By myself I can do nothing; I judge only as I hear
 and my judgment is just

 my testimony is not true. ","There is another who testifies in my favour
 and I know that his testimony about me is true.","\u2018You have sent to John and he has testified to the truth.","Not that I accept human testimony; but I mention it that you may be saved.","John was a lamp that burned and gave light
 and you chose for a time to enjoy his light.","\u2018I have testimony weightier than that of John. For the works that the Father has given me to finish \u2013 the very works that I am doing \u2013 testify that the Father has sent me.","And the Father who sent me has himself testified concerning me. You have never heard his voice nor seen his form
 ","nor does his word dwell in you
 for you do not believe the one he sent. ","You study the Scriptures diligently because you think that in them you have eternal life. These are the very Scriptures that testify about me
 ","yet you refuse to come to me to have life.","\u2018I do not accept glory from human beings
 ","but I know you. I know that you do not have the love of God in your hearts.","I have come in my Father\u2019s name
 and you do not accept me; but if someone else comes in his own name
 you will accept him. ","How can you believe since you accept glory from one another but do not seek the glory that comes from the only God?","\u2018But do not think I will accuse you before the Father. Your accuser is Moses

 you would believe me

","It is written in the Prophets: \u201cThey will all be taught by God.\u201d Everyone who has heard the Father and learned from him comes to me.","No one has seen the Father except the one who is from God; only he has seen the Father.","Very truly I tell you
 the one who believes has eternal life. ","I am the bread of life.","Your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness
 yet they died. ","But here is the bread that comes down from heaven
 which anyone may eat and not die. ","I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Whoever eats this bread will live for ever. This bread is my flesh
 which I will give for the life of the world.\u2019","Jesus said to them
 \u2018Very truly I tell you
 unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood
 you have no life in you. ","Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life
 and I will raise them up at the last day. ","For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink.","Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me
 and I in them. ","Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father
 so the one who feeds on me will live because of me. ","This is the bread that came down from heaven. Your ancestors ate manna and died
 but whoever feeds on this bread will live for ever.\u2019 ","Aware that his disciples were grumbling about this
 Jesus said to them
 \u2018Does this offend you? ","Then what if you see the Son of Man ascend to where he was before!","The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to you \u2013 they are full of the Spirit and life.","Yet there are some of you who do not believe.\u2019 For Jesus had known from the beginning which of them did not believe and who would betray him.","He went on to say
 \u2018This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless the Father has enabled them.\u2019","\u2018You do not want to leave too
 do you?\u2019 Jesus asked the Twelve.","Then Jesus replied
 \u2018Have I not chosen you
 the Twelve? Yet one of you is a devil!\u2019 ","Jesus\u2019 brothers said to him
 \u2018Leave Galilee and go to Judea
 so that your disciples there may see the works you do. ","Therefore Jesus told them
 \u2018My time is not yet here; for you any time will do. ","The world cannot hate you
 but it hates me because I testify that its works are evil. ","You go to the festival. I am not going up to this festival
 because my time has not yet fully come.\u2019 ","Jesus answered
 \u2018My teaching is not my own. It comes from the one who sent me. ","Anyone who chooses to do the will of God will find out whether my teaching comes from God or whether I speak on my own.","Whoever speaks on their own does so to gain personal glory
 but he who seeks the glory of the one who sent him is a man of truth; there is nothing false about him. ","Has not Moses given you the law? Yet not one of you keeps the law. Why are you trying to kill me?\u2019","Jesus said to them
 \u2018I did one miracle
 and you are all amazed. ","Yet
 because Moses gave you circumcision (though actually it did not come from Moses
 but from the patriarchs)
 you circumcise a boy on the Sabbath. ","Now if a boy can be circumcised on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses may not be broken
 why are you angry with me for healing a man\u2019s whole body on the Sabbath? ","Stop judging by mere appearances
 but instead judge correctly.\u2019","At that point some of the people of Jerusalem began to ask
 \u2018Isn\u2019t this the man they are trying to kill? ","Then Jesus
 still teaching in the temple courts
 cried out
 \u2018Yes
 you know me
 and you know where I am from. I am not here on my own authority
 but he who sent me is true. You do not know him
 ","but I know him because I am from him and he sent me.\u2019","Jesus said
 \u2018I am with you for only a short time
 and then I am going to the one who sent me. ","You will look for me
 but you will not find me; and where I am
 you cannot come.\u2019","The Jews said to one another
 \u2018Where does this man intend to go that we cannot find him? Will he go where our people live scattered among the Greeks
 and teach the Greeks? ","On the last and greatest day of the festival
 Jesus stood and said in a loud voice
 \u2018Let anyone who is thirsty come to me and drink. ","Whoever believes in me
 as Scripture has said
 rivers of living water will flow from within them.\u2019 ","By this he meant the Spirit
 whom those who believed in him were later to receive. Up to that time the Spirit had not been given
 since Jesus had not yet been glorified.","and said to Jesus
 \u2018Teacher
 this woman was caught in the act of adultery. ","When they kept on questioning him
 he straightened up and said to them
 \u2018Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.\u2019 ","Jesus straightened up and asked her
 \u2018Woman
 where are they? Has no one condemned you?\u2019","\u2018No one
 sir
\u2019 she said. \u2018Then neither do I condemn you
\u2019 Jesus declared. \u2018Go now and leave your life of sin.\u2019","When Jesus spoke again to the people
 he said
 \u2018I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness
 but will have the light of life.\u2019","Jesus answered
 \u2018Even if I testify on my own behalf
 my testimony is valid
 for I know where I came from and where I am going. But you have no idea where I come from or where I am going. ","You judge by human standards; I pass judgment on no one.","But if I do judge
 my decisions are true
 because I am not alone. I stand with the Father
 who sent me. ","In your own Law it is written that the testimony of two witnesses is true.","I am one who testifies for myself; my other witness is the Father
 who sent me.\u2019","Then they asked him
 \u2018Where is your father?\u2019 \u2018You do not know me or my Father
\u2019 Jesus replied. \u2018If you knew me
 you would know my Father also.\u2019 ","Once more Jesus said to them
 \u2018I am going away
 and you will look for me
 and you will die in your sin. Where I go
 you cannot come.\u2019","But he continued
 \u2018You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world. ","I told you that you would die in your sins; if you do not believe that I am he
 you will indeed die in your sins.\u2019","\u2018Who are you?\u2019 they asked. \u2018Just what I have been telling you from the beginning
\u2019 Jesus replied. ","\u2018I have much to say in judgment of you. But he who sent me is trustworthy
 and what I have heard from him I tell the world.\u2019","So Jesus said
 \u2018When you have lifted up the Son of Man
 then you will know that I am he and that I do nothing on my own but speak just what the Father has taught me. ","The one who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone
 for I always do what pleases him.\u2019 ","To the Jews who had believed him
 Jesus said
 \u2018If you hold to my teaching
 you are really my disciples. ","Then you will know the truth
 and the truth will set you free.\u2019","Jesus replied
 \u2018Very truly I tell you
 everyone who sins is a slave to sin. ","Now a slave has no permanent place in the family
 but a son belongs to it for ever. ","So if the Son sets you free
 you will be free indeed. ","I know you are Abraham\u2019s descendants. Yet you are looking for a way to kill me
 because you have no room for my word. ","I am telling you what I have seen in the Father\u2019s presence
 and you are doing what you have heard from your father.\u2019","\u2018Abraham is our father
\u2019 they answered. \u2018If you were Abraham\u2019s children
\u2019 said Jesus
 \u2018then you would do what Abraham did. ","As it is
 you are looking for a way to kill me
 a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham did not do such things. ","You are doing the works of your own father.\u2019 \u2018We are not illegitimate children
\u2019 they protested. \u2018The only Father we have is God himself.\u2019","Jesus said to them
 \u2018If God were your Father
 you would love me
 for I have come here from God. I have not come on my own; God sent me. ","Why is my language not clear to you? Because you are unable to hear what I say.","You belong to your father
 the devil
 and you want to carry out your father\u2019s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning
 not holding to the truth
 for there is no truth in him. When he lies
 he speaks his native language
 for he is a liar and the father of lies. ","Yet because I tell the truth
 you do not believe me! ","Can any of you prove me guilty of sin? If I am telling the truth
 why don\u2019t you believe me? ","Whoever belongs to God hears what God says. The reason you do not hear is that you do not belong to God.\u2019","\u2018I am not possessed by a demon
\u2019 said Jesus
 \u2018but I honour my Father and you dishonour me. ","I am not seeking glory for myself; but there is one who seeks it
 and he is the judge. ","Very truly I tell you
 whoever obeys my word will never see death.\u2019","At this they exclaimed
 \u2018Now we know that you are demon-possessed! Abraham died and so did the prophets
 yet you say that whoever obeys your word will never taste death. ","Jesus replied
 \u2018If I glorify myself
 my glory means nothing. My Father
 whom you claim as your God
 is the one who glorifies me. ","Though you do not know him
 I know him. If I said I did not
 I would be a liar like you
 but I do know him and obey his word. ","Your father Abraham rejoiced at the thought of seeing my day; he saw it and was glad.\u2019","\u2018Very truly I tell you
\u2019 Jesus answered
 \u2018before Abraham was born
 I am!\u2019 ","\u2018Neither this man nor his parents sinned
\u2019 said Jesus
 \u2018but this happened so that the works of God might be displayed in him. ","As long as it is day
 we must do the works of him who sent me. Night is coming
 when no one can work. ","While I am in the world
 I am the light of the world.\u2019","\u2018Go
\u2019 he told him
 \u2018wash in the Pool of Siloam\u2019 (this word means \u2018Sent\u2019). So the man went and washed
 and came home seeing.","He replied
 \u2018The man they call Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes. He told me to go to Siloam and wash. So I went and washed
 and then I could see.\u2019","\u2018Where is this man?\u2019 they asked him. \u2018I don\u2019t know
\u2019 he said.","A second time they summoned the man who had been blind. \u2018Give glory to God by telling the truth
\u2019 they said. \u2018We know this man is a sinner.\u2019","He replied
 \u2018Whether he is a sinner or not
 I don\u2019t know. One thing I do know. I was blind but now I see!\u2019","Then they asked him
 \u2018What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?\u2019","He answered
 \u2018I have told you already and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his disciples too?\u2019","Jesus heard that they had thrown him out
 and when he found him
 he said
 \u2018Do you believe in the Son of Man?\u2019","Jesus said
 \u2018You have now seen him; in fact
 he is the one speaking with you.\u2019","Jesus said
 \u2018For judgment I have come into this world
 so that the blind will see and those who see will become blind.\u2019","Jesus said
 \u2018If you were blind
 you would not be guilty of sin; but now that you claim you can see
 your guilt remains.","\u2018Very truly I tell you Pharisees
 anyone who does not enter the sheepfold by the gate
 but climbs in by some other way
 is a thief and a robber. ","The one who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep.","The gatekeeper opens the gate for him
 and the sheep listen to his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. ","When he has brought out all his own
 he goes on ahead of them
 and his sheep follow him because they know his voice. ","But they will never follow a stranger; in fact
 they will run away from him because they do not recognise a stranger\u2019s voice.\u2019 ","Therefore Jesus said again
 \u2018Very truly I tell you
 I am the gate for the sheep. ","All who have come before me are thieves and robbers
 but the sheep have not listened to them. ","I am the gate; whoever enters through me will be saved. They will come in and go out
 and find pasture. ","The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life
 and have it to the full.","\u2018I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.","The hired hand is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep. So when he sees the wolf coming
 he abandons the sheep and runs away. Then the wolf attacks the flock and scatters it. ","The man runs away because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep.","\u2018I am the good shepherd; I know my sheep and my sheep know me \u2013","just as the Father knows me and I know the Father \u2013 and I lay down my life for the sheep.","I have other sheep that are not of this sheepfold. I must bring them also. They too will listen to my voice
 and there shall be one flock and one shepherd. ","The reason my Father loves me is that I lay down my life \u2013 only to take it up again.","No one takes it from me
 but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again. This command I received from my Father.\u2019","Jesus answered
 \u2018I did tell you
 but you do not believe. The works I do in my Father\u2019s name testify about me
 ","but you do not believe because you are not my sheep.","My sheep listen to my voice; I know them
 and they follow me. ","I give them eternal life
 and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of my hand. ","My Father
 who has given them to me
 is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father\u2019s hand. ","I and the Father are one.\u2019","but Jesus said to them
 \u2018I have shown you many good works from the Father. For which of these do you stone me?\u2019","Jesus answered them
 \u2018Is it not written in your Law
 \u201cI have said you are \u2018gods\u2019\u201d? ","If he called them \u201cgods\u201d
 to whom the word of God came \u2013 and Scripture cannot be set aside \u2013  ","what about the one whom the Father set apart as his very own and sent into the world? Why then do you accuse me of blasphemy because I said
 \u201cI am God\u2019s Son\u201d? ","Do not believe me unless I do the works of my Father.","But if I do them
 even though you do not believe me
 believe the works
 that you may know and understand that the Father is in me
 and I in the Father.\u2019 ","When he heard this
 Jesus said
 \u2018This illness will not end in death. No
 it is for God\u2019s glory so that God\u2019s Son may be glorified through it.\u2019 ","and then he said to his disciples
 \u2018Let us go back to Judea.\u2019","Jesus answered
 \u2018Are there not twelve hours of daylight? Anyone who walks in the day-time will not stumble
 for they see by this world\u2019s light. ","It is when a person walks at night that they stumble
 for they have no light.\u2019","After he had said this
 he went on to tell them
 \u2018Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I am going there to wake him up.\u2019","So then he told them plainly
 \u2018Lazarus is dead
 ","and for your sake I am glad I was not there
 so that you may believe. But let us go to him.\u2019","Then Thomas (also known as Didymus) said to the rest of the disciples
 \u2018Let us also go
 that we may die with him.\u2019","Jesus said to her
 \u2018Your brother will rise again.\u2019","Jesus said to her
 \u2018I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live
 even though they die; ","and whoever lives by believing in me will never die. Do you believe this?\u2019","\u2018Yes
 Lord
\u2019 she replied
 \u2018I believe that you are the Messiah
 the Son of God
 who is to come into the world.\u2019","When Mary reached the place where Jesus was and saw him
 she fell at his feet and said
 \u2018Lord
 if you had been here
 my brother would not have died.\u2019","\u2018Where have you laid him?\u2019 he asked. \u2018Come and see
 Lord
\u2019 they replied.","\u2018Take away the stone
\u2019 he said. \u2018But
 Lord

 the sister of the dead man
 \u2018by this time there is a bad odour
 for he has been there four days.\u2019","Then Jesus said
 \u2018Did I not tell you that if you believe
 you will see the glory of God?\u2019","So they took away the stone. Then Jesus looked up and said
 \u2018Father
 I thank you that you have heard me. ","I knew that you always hear me
 but I said this for the benefit of the people standing here
 that they may believe that you sent me.\u2019","When he had said this
 Jesus called in a loud voice
 \u2018Lazarus
 come out!\u2019 ","The dead man came out
 his hands and feet wrapped with strips of linen
 and a cloth round his face. Jesus said to them
 \u2018Take off the grave clothes and let him go.\u2019","\u2018Leave her alone
\u2019 Jesus replied. \u2018It was intended that she should save this perfume for the day of my burial. ","You will always have the poor among you
 but you will not always have me.\u2019","Now the crowd that was with him when he called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to spread the word.","So the Pharisees said to one another
 \u2018See
 this is getting us nowhere. Look how the whole world has gone after him!\u2019","They came to Philip
 who was from Bethsaida in Galilee
 with a request. \u2018Sir
\u2019 they said
 \u2018we would like to see Jesus.\u2019 ","Jesus replied
 \u2018The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. ","Very truly I tell you
 unless a grain of wheat falls to the ground and dies
 it remains only a single seed. But if it dies
 it produces many seeds. ","Anyone who loves their life will lose it
 while anyone who hates their life in this world will keep it for eternal life. ","Whoever serves me must follow me; and where I am
 my servant also will be. My Father will honour the one who serves me.","\u2018Now my soul is troubled
 and what shall I say? \u201cFather
 save me from this hour\u201d? No
 it was for this very reason I came to this hour. ","Father
 glorify your name!\u2019 Then a voice came from heaven
 \u2018I have glorified it
 and will glorify it again.\u2019 ","Jesus said
 \u2018This voice was for your benefit
 not mine. ","Now is the time for judgment on this world; now the prince of this world will be driven out.","And I
 when I am lifted up from the earth
 will draw all people to myself.\u2019 ","Then Jesus told them
 \u2018You are going to have the light just a little while longer. Walk while you have the light
 before darkness overtakes you. Whoever walks in the dark does not know where they are going. ","Believe in the light while you have the light
 so that you may become children of light.\u2019 When he had finished speaking
 Jesus left and hid himself from them.","Then Jesus cried out
 \u2018Whoever believes in me does not believe in me only

 I do not judge that person. For I did not come to judge the world
 but to save the world. ","There is a judge for the one who rejects me and does not accept my words; the very words I have spoken will condemn them at the last day.","For I did not speak on my own
 but the Father who sent me commanded me to say all that I have spoken. ","I know that his command leads to eternal life. So whatever I say is just what the Father has told me to say.\u2019","Jesus replied
 \u2018You do not realise now what I am doing

\u2019 said Peter
 \u2018you shall never wash my feet.\u2019 Jesus answered
 \u2018Unless I wash you
 you have no part with me.\u2019","Jesus answered
 \u2018Those who have had a bath need only to wash their feet; their whole body is clean. And you are clean
 though not every one of you.\u2019 ","For he knew who was going to betray him

 you also should wash one another\u2019s feet. ","I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you.","Very truly I tell you
 no servant is greater than his master

 Jesus was troubled in spirit and testified
 \u2018Very truly I tell you

 \u2018It is the one to whom I will give this piece of bread when I have dipped it in the dish.\u2019 Then

 Satan entered into him. So Jesus told him

 just as I have kept my Father\u2019s commands and remain in his love. ","I have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete.","My command is this: love each other as I have loved you.","Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one\u2019s life for one\u2019s friends.","You are my friends if you do what I command.","I no longer call you servants
 because a servant does not know his master\u2019s business. Instead
 I have called you friends
 for everything that I learned from my Father I have made known to you. ","You did not choose me
 but I chose you and appointed you so that you might go and bear fruit \u2013 fruit that will last \u2013 and so that whatever you ask in my name the Father will give you. ","This is my command: love each other.","\u2018If the world hates you
 keep in mind that it hated me first. ","If you belonged to the world
 it would love you as its own. As it is
 you do not belong to the world
 but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you. ","Remember what I told you: \u201cA servant is not greater than his master.\u201d If they persecuted me
 they will persecute you also. If they obeyed my teaching
 they will obey yours also. ","They will treat you this way because of my name
 for they do not know the one who sent me. ","If I had not come and spoken to them
 they would not be guilty of sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin. ","Whoever hates me hates my Father as well.","If I had not done among them the works no one else did
 they would not be guilty of sin. As it is
 they have seen
 and yet they have hated both me and my Father. ","But this is to fulfil what is written in their Law: \u201cThey hated me without reason.\u201d","\u2018When the Advocate comes
 whom I will send to you from the Father \u2013 the Spirit of truth who goes out from the Father \u2013 he will testify about me. ","And you also must testify
 for you have been with me from the beginning.","\u2018All this I have told you so that you will not fall away.","They will put you out of the synagogue; in fact
 the time is coming when anyone who kills you will think they are offering a service to God. ","They will do such things because they have not known the Father or me.","I have told you this
 so that when their time comes you will remember that I warned you about them. I did not tell you this from the beginning because I was with you
 ","but now I am going to him who sent me. None of you asks me
 \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d ","Rather
 you are filled with grief because I have said these things. ","But very truly I tell you
 it is for your good that I am going away. Unless I go away
 the Advocate will not come to you; but if I go
 I will send him to you. ","When he comes
 he will prove the world to be in the wrong about sin and righteousness and judgment: ","about sin
 because people do not believe in me; ","about righteousness
 because I am going to the Father
 where you can see me no longer; ","and about judgment
 because the prince of this world now stands condemned.","\u2018I have much more to say to you
 more than you can now bear. ","But when he
 the Spirit of truth
 comes
 he will guide you into all the truth. He will not speak on his own; he will speak only what he hears
 and he will tell you what is yet to come. ","He will glorify me because it is from me that he will receive what he will make known to you.","All that belongs to the Father is mine. That is why I said the Spirit will receive from me what he will make known to you.\u2019","Jesus went on to say
 \u2018In a little while you will see me no more
 and then after a little while you will see me.\u2019","At this
 some of his disciples said to one another
 \u2018What does he mean by saying
 \u201cIn a little while you will see me no more
 and then after a little while you will see me
\u201d and \u201cBecause I am going to the Father\u201d?\u2019 ","They kept asking
 \u2018What does he mean by \u201ca little while\u201d? We don\u2019t understand what he is saying.\u2019","Jesus saw that they wanted to ask him about this
 so he said to them
 \u2018Are you asking one another what I meant when I said
 \u201cIn a little while you will see me no more
 and then after a little while you will see me\u201d? ","Very truly I tell you
 you will weep and mourn while the world rejoices. You will grieve
 but your grief will turn to joy. ","A woman giving birth to a child has pain because her time has come; but when her baby is born she forgets the anguish because of her joy that a child is born into the world.","So with you: now is your time of grief
 but I will see you again and you will rejoice
 and no one will take away your joy. ","In that day you will no longer ask me anything. Very truly I tell you
 my Father will give you whatever you ask in my name. ","Until now you have not asked for anything in my name. Ask and you will receive
 and your joy will be complete.","\u2018Though I have been speaking figuratively
 a time is coming when I will no longer use this kind of language but will tell you plainly about my Father. ","In that day you will ask in my name. I am not saying that I will ask the Father on your behalf.","No
 the Father himself loves you because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God. ","I came from the Father and entered the world; now I am leaving the world and going back to the Father.\u2019","\u2018Do you now believe?\u2019 Jesus replied.","\u2018A time is coming and in fact has come when you will be scattered
 each to your own home. You will leave me all alone. Yet I am not alone
 for my Father is with me.","\u2018I have told you these things
 so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.\u2019","After Jesus said this
 he looked towards heaven and prayed: \u2018Father
 the hour has come. Glorify your Son
 that your Son may glorify you. ","For you granted him authority over all people that he might give eternal life to all those you have given him.","Now this is eternal life: that they know you
 the only true God
 and Jesus Christ
 whom you have sent. ","I have brought you glory on earth by finishing the work you gave me to do.","And now
 Father
 glorify me in your presence with the glory I had with you before the world began.","\u2018I have revealed you to those whom you gave me out of the world. They were yours; you gave them to me and they have obeyed your word.","Now they know that everything you have given me comes from you.","For I gave them the words you gave me and they accepted them. They knew with certainty that I came from you
 and they believed that you sent me. ","I pray for them. I am not praying for the world
 but for those you have given me
 for they are yours. ","All I have is yours
 and all you have is mine. And glory has come to me through them. ","I will remain in the world no longer
 but they are still in the world
 and I am coming to you. Holy Father
 protect them by the power of your name
 the name you gave me
 so that they may be one as we are one. ","While I was with them
 I protected them and kept them safe by that name you gave me. None has been lost except the one doomed to destruction so that Scripture would be fulfilled.","\u2018I am coming to you now
 but I say these things while I am still in the world
 so that they may have the full measure of my joy within them. ","I have given them your word and the world has hated them
 for they are not of the world any more than I am of the world. ","My prayer is not that you take them out of the world but that you protect them from the evil one.","They are not of the world
 even as I am not of it. ","Sanctify them by the truth; your word is truth.","As you sent me into the world
 I have sent them into the world. ","For them I sanctify myself
 that they too may be truly sanctified.","\u2018My prayer is not for them alone. I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message
 ","that all of them may be one
 Father
 just as you are in me and I am in you. May they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me. ","I have given them the glory that you gave me
 that they may be one as we are one \u2013  ","I in them and you in me \u2013 so that they may be brought to complete unity. Then the world will know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me.","\u2018Father
 I want those you have given me to be with me where I am
 and to see my glory
 the glory you have given me because you loved me before the creation of the world.","\u2018Righteous Father
 though the world does not know you
 I know you
 and they know that you have sent me. ","I have made you known to them
 and will continue to make you known in order that the love you have for me may be in them and that I myself may be in them.\u2019","Jesus
 knowing all that was going to happen to him
 went out and asked them
 \u2018Who is it you want?\u2019","\u2018Jesus of Nazareth
\u2019 they replied. \u2018I am he
\u2019 Jesus said. (And Judas the traitor was standing there with them.) ","When Jesus said
 \u2018I am he
\u2019 they drew back and fell to the ground.","Again he asked them
 \u2018Who is it you want?\u2019 \u2018Jesus of Nazareth
\u2019 they said.","Jesus answered
 \u2018I told you that I am he. If you are looking for me
 then let these men go.\u2019 ","Jesus commanded Peter
 \u2018Put your sword away! Shall I not drink the cup the Father has given me?\u2019","\u2018You aren\u2019t one of this man\u2019s disciples too
 are you?\u2019 she asked Peter. He replied
 \u2018I am not.\u2019","\u2018I have spoken openly to the world
\u2019 Jesus replied. \u2018I always taught in synagogues or at the temple
 where all the Jews come together. I said nothing in secret. ","Why question me? Ask those who heard me. Surely they know what I said.\u2019","\u2018If I said something wrong
\u2019 Jesus replied
 \u2018testify as to what is wrong. But if I spoke the truth
 why did you strike me?\u2019 ","Pilate said
 \u2018Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law.\u2019 \u2018But we have no right to execute anyone
\u2019 they objected. ","\u2018Is that your own idea
\u2019 Jesus asked
 \u2018or did others talk to you about me?\u2019","Jesus said
 \u2018My kingdom is not of this world. If it were
 my servants would fight to prevent my arrest by the Jewish leaders. But now my kingdom is from another place.\u2019","\u2018You are a king
 then!\u2019 said Pilate. Jesus answered
 \u2018You say that I am a king. In fact
 the reason I was born and came into the world is to testify to the truth. Everyone on the side of truth listens to me.\u2019","Once more Pilate came out and said to the Jews gathered there
 \u2018Look
 I am bringing him out to you to let you know that I find no basis for a charge against him.\u2019 ","When Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe
 Pilate said to them
 \u2018Here is the man!\u2019","As soon as the chief priests and their officials saw him
 they shouted
 \u2018Crucify! Crucify!\u2019 But Pilate answered
 \u2018You take him and crucify him. As for me
 I find no basis for a charge against him.\u2019","Jesus answered
 \u2018You would have no power over me if it were not given to you from above. Therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin.\u2019","It was the day of Preparation of the Passover; it was about noon. \u2018Here is your king
\u2019 Pilate said to the Jews.","When Jesus saw his mother there
 and the disciple whom he loved standing near by
 he said to her
 \u2018Woman
 here is your son
\u2019 ","and to the disciple
 \u2018Here is your mother.\u2019 From that time on
 this disciple took her into his home.","Later
 knowing that everything had now been finished
 and so that Scripture would be fulfilled
 Jesus said
 \u2018I am thirsty.\u2019 ","When he had received the drink
 Jesus said
 \u2018It is finished.\u2019 With that
 he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.","So she came running to Simon Peter and the other disciple
 the one Jesus loved
 and said
 \u2018They have taken the Lord out of the tomb
 and we don\u2019t know where they have put him!\u2019","They asked her
 \u2018Woman
 why are you crying?\u2019 \u2018They have taken my Lord away
\u2019 she said
 \u2018and I don\u2019t know where they have put him.\u2019 ","He asked her
 \u2018Woman
 why are you crying? Who is it you are looking for?\u2019 Thinking he was the gardener
 she said
 \u2018Sir
 if you have carried him away
 tell me where you have put him
 and I will get him.\u2019","Jesus said to her
 \u2018Mary.\u2019 She turned towards him and cried out in Aramaic
 \u2018Rabboni!\u2019 (which means \u2018Teacher\u2019).","Jesus said
 \u2018Do not hold on to me
 for I have not yet ascended to the Father. Go instead to my brothers and tell them
 \u201cI am ascending to my Father and your Father
 to my God and your God.\u201d\u2019","On the evening of that first day of the week
 when the disciples were together
 with the doors locked for fear of the Jewish leaders
 Jesus came and stood among them and said
 \u2018Peace be with you!\u2019 ","Again Jesus said
 \u2018Peace be with you! As the Father has sent me
 I am sending you.\u2019 ","And with that he breathed on them and said
 \u2018Receive the Holy Spirit. ","If you forgive anyone\u2019s sins
 their sins are forgiven; if you do not forgive them
 they are not forgiven.\u2019","So the other disciples told him
 \u2018We have seen the Lord!\u2019 But he said to them
 \u2018Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were
 and put my hand into his side
 I will not believe.\u2019","A week later his disciples were in the house again
 and Thomas was with them. Though the doors were locked
 Jesus came and stood among them and said
 \u2018Peace be with you!\u2019 ","Then he said to Thomas
 \u2018Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe.\u2019","Then Jesus told him
 \u2018Because you have seen me
 you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.\u2019","He called out to them
 \u2018Friends
 haven\u2019t you any fish?\u2019 \u2018No
\u2019 they answered.","Jesus said to them
 \u2018Bring some of the fish you have just caught.\u2019 ","Jesus said to them
 \u2018Come and have breakfast.\u2019 None of the disciples dared ask him
 \u2018Who are you?\u2019 They knew it was the Lord. ","When they had finished eating
 Jesus said to Simon Peter
 \u2018Simon son of John
 do you love me more than these?\u2019 \u2018Yes
 Lord
\u2019 he said
 \u2018you know that I love you.\u2019 Jesus said
 \u2018Feed my lambs.\u2019","Again Jesus said
 \u2018Simon son of John
 do you love me?\u2019 He answered
 \u2018Yes
 Lord
 you know that I love you.\u2019 Jesus said
 \u2018Take care of my sheep.\u2019","The third time he said to him
 \u2018Simon son of John
 do you love me?\u2019 Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time
 \u2018Do you love me?\u2019 He said
 \u2018Lord
 you know all things; you know that I love you.\u2019 Jesus said
 \u2018Feed my sheep. ","Very truly I tell you
 when you were younger you dressed yourself and went where you wanted; but when you are old you will stretch out your hands
 and someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go.\u2019 ","Jesus said this to indicate the kind of death by which Peter would glorify God. Then he said to him
 \u2018Follow me!\u2019","Jesus answered
 \u2018If I want him to remain alive until I return
 what is that to you? You must follow me.\u2019 ","Because of this
 the rumour spread among the believers that this disciple would not die. But Jesus did not say that he would not die; he only said
 \u2018If I want him to remain alive until I return
 what is that to you?\u2019","And they asked him
 \u201cWhat then? Are you Elijah?\u201d He said
 \u201cI am not.\u201d \u201cAre you the Prophet?\u201d And he answered
 \u201cNo.\u201d","Then they said to him
 \u201cWho are you
 that we may give an answer to those who sent us? What do you say about yourself?\u201d","He said: \u201cI am \u2018The voice of one crying in the wilderness: \u201cMake straight the way of the Lord
\u201d \u2019 as the prophet Isaiah said.\u201d","Then Jesus turned
 and seeing them following
 said to them
 \u201cWhat do you seek?\u201d They said to Him
 \u201cRabbi\u201d (which is to say
 when translated

 \u201cwhere are You staying?\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cCome and see.\u201d They came and saw where He was staying
 and remained with Him that day (now it was about the tenth hour).","And he brought him to Jesus. Now when Jesus looked at him
 He said
 \u201cYou are Simon the son of Jonah. You shall be called Cephas\u201d (which is translated
 A Stone).","The following day Jesus wanted to go to Galilee
 and He found Philip and said to him
 \u201cFollow Me.\u201d ","Philip found Nathanael and said to him
 \u201cWe have found Him of whom Moses in the law

 \u201cCan anything good come out of Nazareth?\u201d Philip said to him
 \u201cCome and see.\u201d","Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward Him
 and said of him
 \u201cBehold
 an Israelite indeed
 in whom is no deceit!\u201d","Nathanael said to Him
 \u201cHow do You know me?\u201d Jesus answered and said to him
 \u201cBefore Philip called you
 when you were under the fig tree
 I saw you.\u201d","Jesus answered and said to him
 \u201cBecause I said to you
 \u2018I saw you under the fig tree
\u2019 do you believe? You will see greater things than these.\u201d ","And He said to him
 \u201cMost assuredly
 I say to you
 hereafter you shall see heaven open
 and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.\u201d","Jesus said to her
 \u201cWoman
 what does your concern have to do with Me? My hour has not yet come.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cFill the waterpots with water.\u201d And they filled them up to the brim. ","And He said to them
 \u201cDraw some out now
 and take it to the master of the feast.\u201d And they took it. ","And He said to those who sold doves
 \u201cTake these things away! Do not make My Father\u2019s house a house of merchandise!\u201d ","Jesus answered and said to them

 how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things? ","No one has ascended to heaven but He who came down from heaven
 that is
 the Son of Man who is in heaven. ","And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness
 even so must the Son of Man be lifted up
 ","that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life.","For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son

 \u201cMost assuredly
 I say to you
 the Son can do nothing of Himself

 the Son also does in like manner. ","For the Father loves the Son
 and shows Him all things that He Himself does; and He will show Him greater works than these
 that you may marvel. ","For as the Father raises the dead and gives life to them
 even so the Son gives life to whom He will. ","For the Father judges no one
 but has committed all judgment to the Son

 I say to you
 he who hears My word and believes in Him who sent Me has everlasting life
 and shall not come into judgment
 but has passed from death into life. ","Most assuredly
 I say to you
 the hour is coming
 and now is
 when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God; and those who hear will live. ","For as the Father has life in Himself
 so He has granted the Son to have life in Himself
 ","and has given Him authority to execute judgment also
 because He is the Son of Man. ","Do not marvel at this; for the hour is coming in which all who are in the graves will hear His voice","and come forth\u2014those who have done good
 to the resurrection of life

 to the resurrection of condemnation. ","I can of Myself do nothing. As I hear
 I judge; and My judgment is righteous

 My witness is not true. ","There is another who bears witness of Me
 and I know that the witness which He witnesses of Me is true. ","You have sent to John
 and he has borne witness to the truth. ","Yet I do not receive testimony from man
 but I say these things that you may be saved. ","He was the burning and shining lamp
 and you were willing for a time to rejoice in his light. ","But I have a greater witness than John\u2019s; for the works which the Father has given Me to finish\u2014the very works that I do\u2014bear witness of Me
 that the Father has sent Me. ","And the Father Himself
 who sent Me
 has testified of Me. You have neither heard His voice at any time
 nor seen His form. ","But you do not have His word abiding in you
 because whom He sent
 Him you do not believe. ","You search the Scriptures
 for in them you think you have eternal life; and these are they which testify of Me. ","But you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life.","\u201cI do not receive honor from men.","But I know you
 that you do not have the love of God in you. ","I have come in My Father\u2019s name
 and you do not receive Me; if another comes in his own name
 him you will receive. ","How can you believe
 who receive honor from one another
 and do not seek the honor that comes from the only God? ","Do not think that I shall accuse you to the Father; there is one who accuses you\u2014Moses
 in whom you trust. ","For if you believed Moses
 you would believe Me; for he wrote about Me. ","But if you do not believe his writings
 how will you believe My words?\u201d","Then Jesus lifted up His eyes
 and seeing a great multitude coming toward Him
 He said to Philip
 \u201cWhere shall we buy bread
 that these may eat?\u201d ","Then Jesus said
 \u201cMake the people sit down.\u201d Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down
 in number about five thousand. ","So when they were filled
 He said to His disciples
 \u201cGather up the fragments that remain
 so that nothing is lost.\u201d ","But He said to them
 \u201cIt is I; do not be afraid.\u201d ","Jesus answered them and said
 \u201cMost assuredly
 I say to you
 you seek Me
 not because you saw the signs
 but because you ate of the loaves and were filled. ","Do not labor for the food which perishes
 but for the food which endures to everlasting life
 which the Son of Man will give you
 because God the Father has set His seal on Him.\u201d","Jesus answered and said to them
 \u201cThis is the work of God
 that you believe in Him whom He sent.\u201d","Then Jesus said to them
 \u201cMost assuredly
 I say to you
 Moses did not give you the bread from heaven
 but My Father gives you the true bread from heaven. ","For the bread of God is He who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.\u201d","And Jesus said to them
 \u201cI am the bread of life. He who comes to Me shall never hunger
 and he who believes in Me shall never thirst. ","But I said to you that you have seen Me and yet do not believe.","All that the Father gives Me will come to Me
 and the one who comes to Me I will by no means cast out. ","For I have come down from heaven
 not to do My own will
 but the will of Him who sent Me. ","This is the will of the Father who sent Me
 that of all He has given Me I should lose nothing
 but should raise it up at the last day. ","And this is the will of Him who sent Me
 that everyone who sees the Son and believes in Him may have everlasting life; and I will raise him up at the last day.\u201d","Jesus therefore answered and said to them
 \u201cDo not murmur among yourselves. ","No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him; and I will raise him up at the last day.","It is written in the prophets
 \u2018And they shall all be taught by God.\u2019 Therefore everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to Me. ","Not that anyone has seen the Father
 except He who is from God; He has seen the Father. ","Most assuredly
 I say to you
 he who believes in Me has everlasting life. ","I am the bread of life.","Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness
 and are dead. ","This is the bread which comes down from heaven
 that one may eat of it and not die. ","I am the living bread which came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread
 he will live forever; and the bread that I shall give is My flesh
 which I shall give for the life of the world.\u201d","Then Jesus said to them
 \u201cMost assuredly
 I say to you
 unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood
 you have no life in you. ","Whoever eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life
 and I will raise him up at the last day. ","For My flesh is food indeed
 and My blood is drink indeed. ","He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me
 and I in him. ","As the living Father sent Me
 and I live because of the Father
 so he who feeds on Me will live because of Me. ","This is the bread which came down from heaven\u2014not as your fathers ate the manna
 and are dead. He who eats this bread will live forever.\u201d","When Jesus knew in Himself that His disciples complained about this
 He said to them
 \u201cDoes this offend you? ","What then if you should see the Son of Man ascend where He was before?","It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing. The words that I speak to you are spirit
 and they are life. ","But there are some of you who do not believe.\u201d For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe
 and who would betray Him. ","And He said
 \u201cTherefore I have said to you that no one can come to Me unless it has been granted to him by My Father.\u201d","Then Jesus said to the twelve
 \u201cDo you also want to go away?\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cDid I not choose you
 the twelve
 and one of you is a devil?\u201d ","His brothers therefore said to Him
 \u201cDepart from here and go into Judea
 that Your disciples also may see the works that You are doing. ","Then Jesus said to them
 \u201cMy time has not yet come
 but your time is always ready. ","The world cannot hate you
 but it hates Me because I testify of it that its works are evil. ","You go up to this feast. I am not yet going up to this feast
 for My time has not yet fully come.\u201d ","Jesus answered them and said
 \u201cMy doctrine is not Mine
 but His who sent Me. ","If anyone wills to do His will
 he shall know concerning the doctrine
 whether it is from God or whether I speak on My own authority. ","He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory; but He who seeks the glory of the One who sent Him is true
 and no unrighteousness is in Him. ","Did not Moses give you the law
 yet none of you keeps the law? Why do you seek to kill Me?\u201d","Jesus answered and said to them
 \u201cI did one work
 and you all marvel. ","Moses therefore gave you circumcision (not that it is from Moses
 but from the fathers)
 and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath. ","If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath
 so that the law of Moses should not be broken
 are you angry with Me because I made a man completely well on the Sabbath? ","Do not judge according to appearance
 but judge with righteous judgment.\u201d","Now some of them from Jerusalem said
 \u201cIs this not He whom they seek to kill? ","Then Jesus cried out
 as He taught in the temple
 saying
 \u201cYou both know Me
 and you know where I am from; and I have not come of Myself
 but He who sent Me is true
 whom you do not know. ","But I know Him
 for I am from Him
 and He sent Me.\u201d","Then Jesus said to them
 \u201cI shall be with you a little while longer
 and then I go to Him who sent Me. ","You will seek Me and not find Me
 and where I am you cannot come.\u201d","Then the Jews said among themselves
 \u201cWhere does He intend to go that we shall not find Him? Does He intend to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks? ","On the last day
 that great day of the feast
 Jesus stood and cried out
 saying
 \u201cIf anyone thirsts
 let him come to Me and drink. ","He who believes in Me
 as the Scripture has said
 out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.\u201d ","But this He spoke concerning the Spirit
 whom those believing in Him would receive; for the Holy Spirit was not yet given
 because Jesus was not yet glorified.","they said to Him
 \u201cTeacher
 this woman was caught in adultery
 in the very act. ","So when they continued asking Him
 He raised Himself up and said to them
 \u201cHe who is without sin among you
 let him throw a stone at her first.\u201d ","When Jesus had raised Himself up and saw no one but the woman
 He said to her
 \u201cWoman
 where are those accusers of yours? Has no one condemned you?\u201d","She said
 \u201cNo one
 Lord.\u201d And Jesus said to her
 \u201cNeither do I condemn you; go and sin no more.\u201d","Then Jesus spoke to them again
 saying
 \u201cI am the light of the world. He who follows Me shall not walk in darkness
 but have the light of life.\u201d","Jesus answered and said to them
 \u201cEven if I bear witness of Myself
 My witness is true
 for I know where I came from and where I am going; but you do not know where I come from and where I am going. ","You judge according to the flesh; I judge no one.","And yet if I do judge
 My judgment is true; for I am not alone
 but I am with the Father who sent Me. ","It is also written in your law that the testimony of two men is true.","I am One who bears witness of Myself
 and the Father who sent Me bears witness of Me.\u201d","Then they said to Him
 \u201cWhere is Your Father?\u201d Jesus answered
 \u201cYou know neither Me nor My Father. If you had known Me
 you would have known My Father also.\u201d","Then Jesus said to them again
 \u201cI am going away
 and you will seek Me
 and will die in your sin. Where I go you cannot come.\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cYou are from beneath; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world. ","Therefore I said to you that you will die in your sins; for if you do not believe that I am He
 you will die in your sins.\u201d","Then they said to Him
 \u201cWho are You?\u201d And Jesus said to them
 \u201cJust what I have been saying to you from the beginning. ","I have many things to say and to judge concerning you
 but He who sent Me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I heard from Him.\u201d","Then Jesus said to them
 \u201cWhen you lift up the Son of Man
 then you will know that I am He
 and that I do nothing of Myself; but as My Father taught Me
 I speak these things. ","And He who sent Me is with Me. The Father has not left Me alone
 for I always do those things that please Him.\u201d ","Then Jesus said to those Jews who believed Him
 \u201cIf you abide in My word
 you are My disciples indeed. ","And you shall know the truth
 and the truth shall make you free.\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cMost assuredly
 I say to you
 whoever commits sin is a slave of sin. ","And a slave does not abide in the house forever
 but a son abides forever. ","Therefore if the Son makes you free
 you shall be free indeed.","\u201cI know that you are Abraham\u2019s descendants
 but you seek to kill Me
 because My word has no place in you. ","I speak what I have seen with My Father
 and you do what you have seen with your father.\u201d","They answered and said to Him
 \u201cAbraham is our father.\u201d Jesus said to them
 \u201cIf you were Abraham\u2019s children
 you would do the works of Abraham. ","But now you seek to kill Me
 a Man who has told you the truth which I heard from God. Abraham did not do this. ","You do the deeds of your father.\u201d Then they said to Him
 \u201cWe were not born of fornication; we have one Father\u2014God.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cIf God were your Father
 you would love Me
 for I proceeded forth and came from God; nor have I come of Myself
 but He sent Me. ","Why do you not understand My speech? Because you are not able to listen to My word.","You are of your father the devil
 and the desires of your father you want to do. He was a murderer from the beginning
 and does not stand in the truth
 because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie
 he speaks from his own resources
 for he is a liar and the father of it. ","But because I tell the truth
 you do not believe Me. ","Which of you convicts Me of sin? And if I tell the truth
 why do you not believe Me? ","He who is of God hears God\u2019s words; therefore you do not hear
 because you are not of God.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cI do not have a demon; but I honor My Father
 and you dishonor Me. ","And I do not seek My own glory; there is One who seeks and judges.","Most assuredly
 I say to you
 if anyone keeps My word he shall never see death.\u201d","Then the Jews said to Him
 \u201cNow we know that You have a demon! Abraham is dead
 and the prophets; and You say
 \u2018If anyone keeps My word he shall never taste death.\u2019 ","Jesus answered
 \u201cIf I honor Myself
 My honor is nothing. It is My Father who honors Me
 of whom you say that He is your God. ","Yet you have not known Him
 but I know Him. And if I say
 \u2018I do not know Him
\u2019 I shall be a liar like you; but I do know Him and keep His word. ","Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day
 and he saw it and was glad.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cMost assuredly
 I say to you
 before Abraham was
 I AM.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cNeither this man nor his parents sinned
 but that the works of God should be revealed in him. ","I must work the works of Him who sent Me while it is day; the night is coming when no one can work.","As long as I am in the world
 I am the light of the world.\u201d","And He said to him
 \u201cGo
 wash in the pool of Siloam\u201d (which is translated
 Sent). So he went and washed
 and came back seeing.","He answered and said
 \u201cA Man called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes and said to me
 \u2018Go to the pool of Siloam and wash.\u2019 So I went and washed
 and I received sight.\u201d","Then they said to him
 \u201cWhere is He?\u201d He said
 \u201cI do not know.\u201d","So they again called the man who was blind
 and said to him
 \u201cGive God the glory! We know that this Man is a sinner.\u201d","He answered and said
 \u201cWhether He is a sinner or not I do not know. One thing I know: that though I was blind
 now I see.\u201d","Then they said to him again
 \u201cWhat did He do to you? How did He open your eyes?\u201d","He answered them
 \u201cI told you already
 and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also want to become His disciples?\u201d","Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when He had found him
 He said to him
 \u201cDo you believe in the Son of God?\u201d","And Jesus said to him
 \u201cYou have both seen Him and it is He who is talking with you.\u201d","And Jesus said
 \u201cFor judgment I have come into this world
 that those who do not see may see
 and that those who see may be made blind.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cIf you were blind
 you would have no sin; but now you say
 \u2018We see.\u2019 Therefore your sin remains.","\u201cMost assuredly
 I say to you
 he who does not enter the sheepfold by the door
 but climbs up some other way
 the same is a thief and a robber. ","But he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.","To him the doorkeeper opens
 and the sheep hear his voice; and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. ","And when he brings out his own sheep
 he goes before them; and the sheep follow him
 for they know his voice. ","Yet they will by no means follow a stranger
 but will flee from him
 for they do not know the voice of strangers.\u201d ","Then Jesus said to them again
 \u201cMost assuredly
 I say to you
 I am the door of the sheep. ","All who ever came before Me are thieves and robbers
 but the sheep did not hear them. ","I am the door. If anyone enters by Me
 he will be saved
 and will go in and out and find pasture. ","The thief does not come except to steal
 and to kill
 and to destroy. I have come that they may have life
 and that they may have it more abundantly.","\u201cI am the good shepherd. The good shepherd gives His life for the sheep.","But a hireling
 he who is not the shepherd
 one who does not own the sheep
 sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees; and the wolf catches the sheep and scatters them. ","The hireling flees because he is a hireling and does not care about the sheep.","I am the good shepherd; and I know My sheep
 and am known by My own. ","As the Father knows Me
 even so I know the Father; and I lay down My life for the sheep. ","And other sheep I have which are not of this fold; them also I must bring
 and they will hear My voice; and there will be one flock and one shepherd.","\u201cTherefore My Father loves Me
 because I lay down My life that I may take it again. ","No one takes it from Me
 but I lay it down of Myself. I have power to lay it down
 and I have power to take it again. This command I have received from My Father.\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cI told you
 and you do not believe. The works that I do in My Father\u2019s name
 they bear witness of Me. ","But you do not believe
 because you are not of My sheep
 as I said to you. ","My sheep hear My voice
 and I know them
 and they follow Me. ","And I give them eternal life
 and they shall never perish; neither shall anyone snatch them out of My hand. ","My Father
 who has given them to Me
 is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch them out of My Father\u2019s hand. ","I and My Father are one.\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cMany good works I have shown you from My Father. For which of those works do you stone Me?\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cIs it not written in your law
 \u2018I said
 \u201cYou are gods\u201d \u2019? ","If He called them gods
 to whom the word of God came (and the Scripture cannot be broken)
 ","do you say of Him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world
 \u2018You are blaspheming
\u2019 because I said
 \u2018I am the Son of God\u2019? ","If I do not do the works of My Father
 do not believe Me; ","but if I do
 though you do not believe Me
 believe the works
 that you may know and believe that the Father is in Me
 and I in Him.\u201d ","When Jesus heard that
 He said
 \u201cThis sickness is not unto death
 but for the glory of God
 that the Son of God may be glorified through it.\u201d","Then after this He said to the disciples
 \u201cLet us go to Judea again.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cAre there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the day
 he does not stumble
 because he sees the light of this world. ","But if one walks in the night
 he stumbles
 because the light is not in him.\u201d ","These things He said
 and after that He said to them
 \u201cOur friend Lazarus sleeps
 but I go that I may wake him up.\u201d","Then Jesus said to them plainly
 \u201cLazarus is dead. ","And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there
 that you may believe. Nevertheless let us go to him.\u201d","Then Thomas
 who is called the Twin
 said to his fellow disciples
 \u201cLet us also go
 that we may die with Him.\u201d","Jesus said to her
 \u201cYour brother will rise again.\u201d","Jesus said to her
 \u201cI am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in Me
 though he may die
 he shall live. ","And whoever lives and believes in Me shall never die. Do you believe this?\u201d","She said to Him
 \u201cYes
 Lord
 I believe that You are the Christ
 the Son of God
 who is to come into the world.\u201d","Then
 when Mary came where Jesus was
 and saw Him
 she fell down at His feet
 saying to Him
 \u201cLord
 if You had been here
 my brother would not have died.\u201d","And He said
 \u201cWhere have you laid him?\u201d They said to Him
 \u201cLord
 come and see.\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cTake away the stone.\u201d Martha
 the sister of him who was dead
 said to Him
 \u201cLord
 by this time there is a stench
 for he has been dead four days.\u201d","Jesus said to her
 \u201cDid I not say to you that if you would believe you would see the glory of God?\u201d ","Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead man was lying. And Jesus lifted up His eyes and said
 \u201cFather
 I thank You that You have heard Me. ","And I know that You always hear Me
 but because of the people who are standing by I said this
 that they may believe that You sent Me.\u201d ","Now when He had said these things
 He cried with a loud voice
 \u201cLazarus
 come forth!\u201d ","And he who had died came out bound hand and foot with graveclothes
 and his face was wrapped with a cloth. Jesus said to them
 \u201cLoose him
 and let him go.\u201d","But Jesus said
 \u201cLet her alone; she has kept this for the day of My burial. ","For the poor you have with you always
 but Me you do not have always.\u201d","Therefore the people
 who were with Him when He called Lazarus out of his tomb and raised him from the dead
 bore witness. ","The Pharisees therefore said among themselves
 \u201cYou see that you are accomplishing nothing. Look
 the world has gone after Him!\u201d","Then they came to Philip
 who was from Bethsaida of Galilee
 and asked him
 saying
 \u201cSir
 we wish to see Jesus.\u201d","But Jesus answered them
 saying
 \u201cThe hour has come that the Son of Man should be glorified. ","Most assuredly
 I say to you
 unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies
 it remains alone; but if it dies
 it produces much grain. ","He who loves his life will lose it
 and he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life. ","If anyone serves Me
 let him follow Me; and where I am
 there My servant will be also. If anyone serves Me
 him My Father will honor.","\u201cNow My soul is troubled
 and what shall I say? \u2018Father
 save Me from this hour\u2019? But for this purpose I came to this hour. ","Father
 glorify Your name.\u201d Then a voice came from heaven
 saying
 \u201cI have both glorified it and will glorify it again.\u201d","Jesus answered and said
 \u201cThis voice did not come because of Me
 but for your sake. ","Now is the judgment of this world; now the ruler of this world will be cast out.","And I
 if I am lifted up from the earth
 will draw all peoples to Myself.\u201d ","Then Jesus said to them
 \u201cA little while longer the light is with you. Walk while you have the light
 lest darkness overtake you; he who walks in darkness does not know where he is going. ","While you have the light
 believe in the light
 that you may become sons of light.\u201d These things Jesus spoke
 and departed
 and was hidden from them.","Then Jesus cried out and said
 \u201cHe who believes in Me
 believes not in Me but in Him who sent Me. ","And he who sees Me sees Him who sent Me.","I have come as a light into the world
 that whoever believes in Me should not abide in darkness. ","And if anyone hears My words and does not believe
 I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world but to save the world. ","He who rejects Me
 and does not receive My words
 has that which judges him\u2014the word that I have spoken will judge him in the last day. ","For I have not spoken on My own authority; but the Father who sent Me gave Me a command
 what I should say and what I should speak. ","And I know that His command is everlasting life. Therefore
 whatever I speak
 just as the Father has told Me
 so I speak.\u201d","Jesus answered and said to him
 \u201cWhat I am doing you do not understand now
 but you will know after this.\u201d","Peter said to Him
 \u201cYou shall never wash my feet!\u201d Jesus answered him
 \u201cIf I do not wash you
 you have no part with Me.\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cHe who is bathed needs only to wash his feet
 but is completely clean; and you are clean
 but not all of you.\u201d ","For He knew who would betray Him; therefore He said
 \u201cYou are not all clean.\u201d","So when He had washed their feet
 taken His garments
 and sat down again
 He said to them
 \u201cDo you know what I have done to you? ","You call Me Teacher and Lord
 and you say well
 for so I am. ","If I then
 your Lord and Teacher
 have washed your feet
 you also ought to wash one another\u2019s feet. ","For I have given you an example
 that you should do as I have done to you. ","Most assuredly
 I say to you
 a servant is not greater than his master; nor is he who is sent greater than he who sent him. ","If you know these things
 blessed are you if you do them.","\u201cI do not speak concerning all of you. I know whom I have chosen; but that the Scripture may be fulfilled
 \u2018He who eats bread with Me has lifted up his heel against Me.\u2019 ","Now I tell you before it comes
 that when it does come to pass
 you may believe that I am He. ","Most assuredly
 I say to you
 he who receives whomever I send receives Me; and he who receives Me receives Him who sent Me.\u201d","When Jesus had said these things
 He was troubled in spirit
 and testified and said
 \u201cMost assuredly
 I say to you
 one of you will betray Me.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cIt is he to whom I shall give a piece of bread when I have dipped it.\u201d And having dipped the bread
 He gave it to Judas Iscariot
 the son of Simon. ","Now after the piece of bread
 Satan entered him. Then Jesus said to him
 \u201cWhat you do
 do quickly.\u201d ","So
 when he had gone out

 that you love one another; as I have loved you
 that you also love one another. ","By this all will know that you are My disciples

 \u201cWill you lay down your life for My sake? Most assuredly

 I say to you
 he who believes in Me
 the works that I do he will do also; and greater works than these he will do

 that I will do
 that the Father may be glorified in the Son. ","If you ask anything in My name
 I will do it.","\u201cIf you love Me

 for He dwells with you and will be in you. ","I will not leave you orphans; I will come to you.","\u201cA little while longer and the world will see Me no more
 but you will see Me. Because I live
 you will live also. ","At that day you will know that I am in My Father
 and you in Me
 and I in you. ","He who has My commandments and keeps them
 it is he who loves Me. And he who loves Me will be loved by My Father
 and I will love him and manifest Myself to him.\u201d","Judas (not Iscariot) said to Him
 \u201cLord
 how is it that You will manifest Yourself to us
 and not to the world?\u201d","Jesus answered and said to him
 \u201cIf anyone loves Me
 he will keep My word; and My Father will love him
 and We will come to him and make Our home with him. ","He who does not love Me does not keep My words; and the word which you hear is not Mine but the Father\u2019s who sent Me.","\u201cThese things I have spoken to you while being present with you.","But the Helper
 the Holy Spirit
 whom the Father will send in My name
 He will teach you all things
 and bring to your remembrance all things that I said to you. ","Peace I leave with you
 My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your heart be troubled
 neither let it be afraid. ","You have heard Me say to you
 \u2018I am going away and coming back to you.\u2019 If you loved Me
 you would rejoice because I said
 \u2018I am going to the Father
\u2019 for My Father is greater than I.","\u201cAnd now I have told you before it comes
 that when it does come to pass
 you may believe. ","I will no longer talk much with you
 for the ruler of this world is coming
 and he has nothing in Me. ","But that the world may know that I love the Father
 and as the Father gave Me commandment
 so I do. Arise
 let us go from here.","\u201cI am the true vine
 and My Father is the vinedresser. ","Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit He takes away; and every branch that bears fruit He prunes
 that it may bear more fruit. ","You are already clean because of the word which I have spoken to you.","Abide in Me
 and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself
 unless it abides in the vine
 neither can you
 unless you abide in Me.","\u201cI am the vine
 you are the branches. He who abides in Me
 and I in him
 bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing. ","If anyone does not abide in Me
 he is cast out as a branch and is withered; and they gather them and throw them into the fire
 and they are burned. ","If you abide in Me
 and My words abide in you
 you will ask what you desire
 and it shall be done for you. ","By this My Father is glorified
 that you bear much fruit; so you will be My disciples.","\u201cAs the Father loved Me
 I also have loved you; abide in My love. ","If you keep My commandments
 you will abide in My love
 just as I have kept My Father\u2019s commandments and abide in His love.","\u201cThese things I have spoken to you
 that My joy may remain in you
 and that your joy may be full. ","This is My commandment
 that you love one another as I have loved you. ","Greater love has no one than this
 than to lay down one\u2019s life for his friends. ","You are My friends if you do whatever I command you.","No longer do I call you servants
 for a servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends
 for all things that I heard from My Father I have made known to you. ","You did not choose Me
 but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit
 and that your fruit should remain
 that whatever you ask the Father in My name He may give you. ","These things I command you
 that you love one another.","\u201cIf the world hates you
 you know that it hated Me before it hated you. ","If you were of the world
 the world would love its own. Yet because you are not of the world
 but I chose you out of the world
 therefore the world hates you. ","Remember the word that I said to you
 \u2018A servant is not greater than his master.\u2019 If they persecuted Me
 they will also persecute you. If they kept My word
 they will keep yours also. ","But all these things they will do to you for My name\u2019s sake
 because they do not know Him who sent Me. ","If I had not come and spoken to them
 they would have no sin
 but now they have no excuse for their sin. ","He who hates Me hates My Father also.","If I had not done among them the works which no one else did
 they would have no sin; but now they have seen and also hated both Me and My Father. ","But this happened that the word might be fulfilled which is written in their law
 \u2018They hated Me without a cause.\u2019","\u201cBut when the Helper comes
 whom I shall send to you from the Father
 the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father
 He will testify of Me. ","And you also will bear witness
 because you have been with Me from the beginning.","\u201cThese things I have spoken to you
 that you should not be made to stumble. ","They will put you out of the synagogues; yes
 the time is coming that whoever kills you will think that he offers God service. ","And these things they will do to you because they have not known the Father nor Me.","But these things I have told you
 that when the time comes
 you may remember that I told you of them. \u201cAnd these things I did not say to you at the beginning
 because I was with you.","\u201cBut now I go away to Him who sent Me
 and none of you asks Me
 \u2018Where are You going?\u2019 ","But because I have said these things to you
 sorrow has filled your heart. ","Nevertheless I tell you the truth. It is to your advantage that I go away; for if I do not go away
 the Helper will not come to you; but if I depart
 I will send Him to you. ","And when He has come
 He will convict the world of sin
 and of righteousness
 and of judgment: ","of sin
 because they do not believe in Me; ","of righteousness
 because I go to My Father and you see Me no more; ","of judgment
 because the ruler of this world is judged.","\u201cI still have many things to say to you
 but you cannot bear them now. ","However
 when He
 the Spirit of truth
 has come
 He will guide you into all truth; for He will not speak on His own authority
 but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will tell you things to come. ","He will glorify Me
 for He will take of what is Mine and declare it to you. ","All things that the Father has are Mine. Therefore I said that He will take of Mine and declare it to you.","\u201cA little while
 and you will not see Me; and again a little while
 and you will see Me
 because I go to the Father.\u201d","Then some of His disciples said among themselves
 \u201cWhat is this that He says to us
 \u2018A little while
 and you will not see Me; and again a little while
 and you will see Me\u2019; and
 \u2018because I go to the Father\u2019?\u201d ","They said therefore
 \u201cWhat is this that He says
 \u2018A little while\u2019? We do not know what He is saying.\u201d","Now Jesus knew that they desired to ask Him
 and He said to them
 \u201cAre you inquiring among yourselves about what I said
 \u2018A little while
 and you will not see Me; and again a little while
 and you will see Me\u2019? ","Most assuredly
 I say to you that you will weep and lament
 but the world will rejoice; and you will be sorrowful
 but your sorrow will be turned into joy. ","A woman
 when she is in labor
 has sorrow because her hour has come; but as soon as she has given birth to the child
 she no longer remembers the anguish
 for joy that a human being has been born into the world. ","Therefore you now have sorrow; but I will see you again and your heart will rejoice
 and your joy no one will take from you.","\u201cAnd in that day you will ask Me nothing. Most assuredly
 I say to you
 whatever you ask the Father in My name He will give you. ","Until now you have asked nothing in My name. Ask
 and you will receive
 that your joy may be full.","\u201cThese things I have spoken to you in figurative language; but the time is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figurative language
 but I will tell you plainly about the Father. ","In that day you will ask in My name
 and I do not say to you that I shall pray the Father for you; ","for the Father Himself loves you
 because you have loved Me
 and have believed that I came forth from God. ","I came forth from the Father and have come into the world. Again
 I leave the world and go to the Father.\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cDo you now believe? ","Indeed the hour is coming
 yes
 has now come
 that you will be scattered
 each to his own
 and will leave Me alone. And yet I am not alone
 because the Father is with Me. ","These things I have spoken to you
 that in Me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation; but be of good cheer
 I have overcome the world.\u201d","Jesus spoke these words
 lifted up His eyes to heaven
 and said: \u201cFather
 the hour has come. Glorify Your Son
 that Your Son also may glorify You
 ","as You have given Him authority over all flesh

 that they may know You
 the only true God
 and Jesus Christ whom You have sent. ","I have glorified You on the earth. I have finished the work which You have given Me to do.","And now
 O Father
 glorify Me together with Yourself
 with the glory which I had with You before the world was.","\u201cI have manifested Your name to the men whom You have given Me out of the world. They were Yours
 You gave them to Me
 and they have kept Your word. ","Now they have known that all things which You have given Me are from You.","For I have given to them the words which You have given Me; and they have received them
 and have known surely that I came forth from You; and they have believed that You sent Me.","\u201cI pray for them. I do not pray for the world but for those whom You have given Me

 I kept them in Your name. Those whom You gave Me I have kept; and none of them is lost except the son of perdition
 that the Scripture might be fulfilled. ","But now I come to You

 I also have sent them into the world. ","And for their sakes I sanctify Myself

 I desire that they also whom You gave Me may be with Me where I am
 that they may behold My glory which You have given Me; for You loved Me before the foundation of the world. ","O righteous Father! The world has not known You

 knowing all things that would come upon Him
 went forward and said to them
 \u201cWhom are you seeking?\u201d","They answered Him
 \u201cJesus of Nazareth.\u201d Jesus said to them
 \u201cI am He.\u201d And Judas
 who betrayed Him
 also stood with them. ","Now when He said to them
 \u201cI am He
\u201d they drew back and fell to the ground.","Then He asked them again
 \u201cWhom are you seeking?\u201d And they said
 \u201cJesus of Nazareth.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cI have told you that I am He. Therefore
 if you seek Me
 let these go their way
\u201d ","So Jesus said to Peter
 \u201cPut your sword into the sheath. Shall I not drink the cup which My Father has given Me?\u201d","Then the servant girl who kept the door said to Peter
 \u201cYou are not also one of this Man\u2019s disciples
 are you?\u201d He said
 \u201cI am not.\u201d","Jesus answered him
 \u201cI spoke openly to the world. I always taught in synagogues and in the temple
 where the Jews always meet
 and in secret I have said nothing. ","Why do you ask Me? Ask those who have heard Me what I said to them. Indeed they know what I said.\u201d","Jesus answered him
 \u201cIf I have spoken evil
 bear witness of the evil; but if well
 why do you strike Me?\u201d","Then Pilate said to them
 \u201cYou take Him and judge Him according to your law.\u201d Therefore the Jews said to him
 \u201cIt is not lawful for us to put anyone to death
\u201d ","Jesus answered him
 \u201cAre you speaking for yourself about this
 or did others tell you this concerning Me?\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cMy kingdom is not of this world. If My kingdom were of this world
 My servants would fight
 so that I should not be delivered to the Jews; but now My kingdom is not from here.\u201d","Pilate therefore said to Him
 \u201cAre You a king then?\u201d Jesus answered
 \u201cYou say rightly that I am a king. For this cause I was born
 and for this cause I have come into the world
 that I should bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears My voice.\u201d","Pilate then went out again
 and said to them
 \u201cBehold
 I am bringing Him out to you
 that you may know that I find no fault in Him.\u201d","Then Jesus came out
 wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. And Pilate said to them
 \u201cBehold the Man!\u201d","Therefore
 when the chief priests and officers saw Him
 they cried out
 saying
 \u201cCrucify Him
 crucify Him!\u201d Pilate said to them
 \u201cYou take Him and crucify Him
 for I find no fault in Him.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cYou could have no power at all against Me unless it had been given you from above. Therefore the one who delivered Me to you has the greater sin.\u201d","Now it was the Preparation Day of the Passover
 and about the sixth hour. And he said to the Jews
 \u201cBehold your King!\u201d","When Jesus therefore saw His mother
 and the disciple whom He loved standing by
 He said to His mother
 \u201cWoman
 behold your son!\u201d ","Then He said to the disciple
 \u201cBehold your mother!\u201d And from that hour that disciple took her to his own home.","After this
 Jesus
 knowing that all things were now accomplished
 that the Scripture might be fulfilled
 said
 \u201cI thirst!\u201d ","So when Jesus had received the sour wine
 He said
 \u201cIt is finished!\u201d And bowing His head
 He gave up His spirit.","Then she ran and came to Simon Peter
 and to the other disciple
 whom Jesus loved

 \u201cThey have taken away the Lord out of the tomb
 and we do not know where they have laid Him.\u201d","Then they said to her
 \u201cWoman
 why are you weeping?\u201d She said to them
 \u201cBecause they have taken away my Lord
 and I do not know where they have laid Him.\u201d","Jesus said to her
 \u201cWoman
 why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?\u201d She
 supposing Him to be the gardener
 said to Him
 \u201cSir
 if You have carried Him away
 tell me where You have laid Him
 and I will take Him away.\u201d","Jesus said to her
 \u201cMary!\u201d She turned and said to Him
 \u201cRabboni!\u201d (which is to say
 Teacher).","Jesus said to her
 \u201cDo not cling to Me
 for I have not yet ascended to My Father; but go to My brethren and say to them
 \u2018I am ascending to My Father and your Father
 and to My God and your God.\u2019 \u201d","Then
 the same day at evening
 being the first day of the week
 when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled
 for fear of the Jews
 Jesus came and stood in the midst
 and said to them
 \u201cPeace be with you.\u201d ","So Jesus said to them again
 \u201cPeace to you! As the Father has sent Me
 I also send you.\u201d ","And when He had said this
 He breathed on them
 and said to them
 \u201cReceive the Holy Spirit. ","If you forgive the sins of any
 they are forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any
 they are retained.\u201d","The other disciples therefore said to him
 \u201cWe have seen the Lord.\u201d So he said to them
 \u201cUnless I see in His hands the print of the nails
 and put my finger into the print of the nails
 and put my hand into His side
 I will not believe.\u201d","And after eight days His disciples were again inside
 and Thomas with them. Jesus came
 the doors being shut
 and stood in the midst
 and said
 \u201cPeace to you!\u201d ","Then He said to Thomas
 \u201cReach your finger here
 and look at My hands; and reach your hand here
 and put it into My side. Do not be unbelieving
 but believing.\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cThomas
 because you have seen Me
 you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.\u201d","Then Jesus said to them
 \u201cChildren
 have you any food?\u201d They answered Him
 \u201cNo.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cBring some of the fish which you have just caught.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cCome and eat breakfast.\u201d Yet none of the disciples dared ask Him
 \u201cWho are You?\u201d\u2014knowing that it was the Lord. ","So when they had eaten breakfast
 Jesus said to Simon Peter
 \u201cSimon
 son of Jonah
 do you love Me more than these?\u201d He said to Him
 \u201cYes
 Lord; You know that I love You.\u201d He said to him
 \u201cFeed My lambs.\u201d","He said to him again a second time
 \u201cSimon
 son of Jonah
 do you love Me?\u201d He said to Him
 \u201cYes
 Lord; You know that I love You.\u201d He said to him
 \u201cTend My sheep.\u201d","He said to him the third time
 \u201cSimon
 son of Jonah
 do you love Me?\u201d Peter was grieved because He said to him the third time
 \u201cDo you love Me?\u201d And he said to Him
 \u201cLord
 You know all things; You know that I love You.\u201d Jesus said to him
 \u201cFeed My sheep. ","Most assuredly
 I say to you
 when you were younger
 you girded yourself and walked where you wished; but when you are old
 you will stretch out your hands
 and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish.\u201d ","This He spoke
 signifying by what death he would glorify God. And when He had spoken this
 He said to him
 \u201cFollow Me.\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cIf I will that he remain till I come
 what is that to you? You follow Me.\u201d","Then this saying went out among the brethren that this disciple would not die. Yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die

 who are you?\u201d they asked. \u201cAre you Elijah?\u201d \u201cNo

 so the Son of Man must be lifted up
","so that everyone who believes in him will have eternal life.","\u201cFor this is how God loved the world: He gave his one and only Son
 so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life.","God sent his Son into the world not to judge the world

 \u201cWill you never believe in me unless you see miraculous signs and wonders?\u201d","Then Jesus told him
 \u201cGo back home. Your son will live!\u201d And the man believed what Jesus said and started home.","He asked them when the boy had begun to get better
 and they replied
 \u201cYesterday afternoon at one o\u2019clock his fever suddenly disappeared!\u201d","Then the father realized that that was the very time Jesus had told him
 \u201cYour son will live.\u201d And he and his entire household believed in Jesus.","When Jesus saw him and knew he had been ill for a long time
 he asked him
 \u201cWould you like to get well?\u201d","Jesus told him
 \u201cStand up
 pick up your mat
 and walk!\u201d","But he replied
 \u201cThe man who healed me told me
 \u2018Pick up your mat and walk.\u2019\u201d","But afterward Jesus found him in the Temple and told him
 \u201cNow you are well; so stop sinning
 or something even worse may happen to you.\u201d","But Jesus replied
 \u201cMy Father is always working
 and so am I.\u201d","So Jesus explained
 \u201cI tell you the truth
 the Son can do nothing by himself. He does only what he sees the Father doing. Whatever the Father does
 the Son also does.","For the Father loves the Son and shows him everything he is doing. In fact
 the Father will show him how to do even greater works than healing this man. Then you will truly be astonished.","For just as the Father gives life to those he raises from the dead
 so the Son gives life to anyone he wants.","In addition
 the Father judges no one. Instead
 he has given the Son absolute authority to judge
","so that everyone will honor the Son
 just as they honor the Father. Anyone who does not honor the Son is certainly not honoring the Father who sent him.","\u201cI tell you the truth
 those who listen to my message and believe in God who sent me have eternal life. They will never be condemned for their sins
 but they have already passed from death into life.","\u201cAnd I assure you that the time is coming
 indeed it\u2019s here now
 when the dead will hear my voice\u2014the voice of the Son of God. And those who listen will live.","The Father has life in himself
 and he has granted that same life-giving power to his Son.","And he has given him authority to judge everyone because he is the Son of Man.","Don\u2019t be so surprised! Indeed
 the time is coming when all the dead in their graves will hear the voice of God\u2019s Son
","and they will rise again. Those who have done good will rise to experience eternal life
 and those who have continued in evil will rise to experience judgment.","I can do nothing on my own. I judge as God tells me. Therefore
 my judgment is just
 because I carry out the will of the one who sent me
 not my own will.","\u201cIf I were to testify on my own behalf
 my testimony would not be valid.","But someone else is also testifying about me
 and I assure you that everything he says about me is true.","In fact
 you sent investigators to listen to John the Baptist
 and his testimony about me was true.","Of course
 I have no need of human witnesses
 but I say these things so you might be saved.","John was like a burning and shining lamp
 and you were excited for a while about his message.","But I have a greater witness than John\u2014my teachings and my miracles. The Father gave me these works to accomplish
 and they prove that he sent me.","And the Father who sent me has testified about me himself. You have never heard his voice or seen him face to face
","and you do not have his message in your hearts
 because you do not believe me\u2014the one he sent to you.","\u201cYou search the Scriptures because you think they give you eternal life. But the Scriptures point to me!","Yet you refuse to come to me to receive this life.","\u201cYour approval means nothing to me
","because I know you don\u2019t have God\u2019s love within you.","For I have come to you in my Father\u2019s name
 and you have rejected me. Yet if others come in their own name
 you gladly welcome them.","No wonder you can\u2019t believe! For you gladly honor each other
 but you don\u2019t care about the honor that comes from the one who alone is God.","\u201cYet it isn\u2019t I who will accuse you before the Father. Moses will accuse you! Yes
 Moses
 in whom you put your hopes.","If you really believed Moses
 you would believe me
 because he wrote about me.","But since you don\u2019t believe what he wrote
 how will you believe what I say?\u201d","Jesus soon saw a huge crowd of people coming to look for him. Turning to Philip
 he asked
 \u201cWhere can we buy bread to feed all these people?\u201d","\u201cTell everyone to sit down
\u201d Jesus said. So they all sat down on the grassy slopes. (The men alone numbered about 5
000.)","After everyone was full
 Jesus told his disciples
 \u201cNow gather the leftovers
 so that nothing is wasted.\u201d","but he called out to them
 \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. I am here!\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cI tell you the truth
 you want to be with me because I fed you
 not because you understood the miraculous signs.","But don\u2019t be so concerned about perishable things like food. Spend your energy seeking the eternal life that the Son of Man can give you. For God the Father has given me the seal of his approval.\u201d","Jesus told them
 \u201cThis is the only work God wants from you: Believe in the one he has sent.\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cI tell you the truth
 Moses didn\u2019t give you bread from heaven. My Father did. And now he offers you the true bread from heaven.","The true bread of God is the one who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cI am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never be hungry again. Whoever believes in me will never be thirsty.","But you haven\u2019t believed in me even though you have seen me.","However
 those the Father has given me will come to me
 and I will never reject them.","For I have come down from heaven to do the will of God who sent me
 not to do my own will.","And this is the will of God
 that I should not lose even one of all those he has given me
 but that I should raise them up at the last day.","For it is my Father\u2019s will that all who see his Son and believe in him should have eternal life. I will raise them up at the last day.\u201d","But Jesus replied
 \u201cStop complaining about what I said.","For no one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws them to me
 and at the last day I will raise them up.","As it is written in the Scriptures
 \u2018They will all be taught by God.\u2019 Everyone who listens to the Father and learns from him comes to me.","(Not that anyone has ever seen the Father; only I
 who was sent from God
 have seen him.)","\u201cI tell you the truth
 anyone who believes has eternal life.","Yes
 I am the bread of life!","Your ancestors ate manna in the wilderness
 but they all died.","Anyone who eats the bread from heaven
 however
 will never die.","I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Anyone who eats this bread will live forever; and this bread
 which I will offer so the world may live
 is my flesh.\u201d","So Jesus said again
 \u201cI tell you the truth
 unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood
 you cannot have eternal life within you.","But anyone who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life
 and I will raise that person at the last day.","For my flesh is true food
 and my blood is true drink.","Anyone who eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me
 and I in him.","I live because of the living Father who sent me; in the same way
 anyone who feeds on me will live because of me.","I am the true bread that came down from heaven. Anyone who eats this bread will not die as your ancestors did (even though they ate the manna) but will live forever.\u201d","Jesus was aware that his disciples were complaining
 so he said to them
 \u201cDoes this offend you?","Then what will you think if you see the Son of Man ascend to heaven again?","The Spirit alone gives eternal life. Human effort accomplishes nothing. And the very words I have spoken to you are spirit and life.","But some of you do not believe me.\u201d (For Jesus knew from the beginning which ones didn\u2019t believe
 and he knew who would betray him.)","Then he said
 \u201cThat is why I said that people can\u2019t come to me unless the Father gives them to me.\u201d","Then Jesus turned to the Twelve and asked
 \u201cAre you also going to leave?\u201d","Then Jesus said
 \u201cI chose the twelve of you
 but one is a devil.\u201d","and Jesus\u2019 brothers said to him
 \u201cLeave here and go to Judea
 where your followers can see your miracles!","Jesus replied
 \u201cNow is not the right time for me to go
 but you can go anytime.","The world can\u2019t hate you
 but it does hate me because I accuse it of doing evil.","You go on. I\u2019m not going to this festival
 because my time has not yet come.\u201d","So Jesus told them
 \u201cMy message is not my own; it comes from God who sent me.","Anyone who wants to do the will of God will know whether my teaching is from God or is merely my own.","Those who speak for themselves want glory only for themselves
 but a person who seeks to honor the one who sent him speaks truth
 not lies.","Moses gave you the law
 but none of you obeys it! In fact
 you are trying to kill me.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cI did one miracle on the Sabbath
 and you were amazed.","But you work on the Sabbath
 too
 when you obey Moses\u2019 law of circumcision. (Actually
 this tradition of circumcision began with the patriarchs
 long before the law of Moses.)","For if the correct time for circumcising your son falls on the Sabbath
 you go ahead and do it so as not to break the law of Moses. So why should you be angry with me for healing a man on the Sabbath?","Look beneath the surface so you can judge correctly.\u201d","Some of the people who lived in Jerusalem started to ask each other
 \u201cIsn\u2019t this the man they are trying to kill?","While Jesus was teaching in the Temple
 he called out
 \u201cYes
 you know me
 and you know where I come from. But I\u2019m not here on my own. The one who sent me is true
 and you don\u2019t know him.","But I know him because I come from him
 and he sent me to you.\u201d","But Jesus told them
 \u201cI will be with you only a little longer. Then I will return to the one who sent me.","You will search for me but not find me. And you cannot go where I am going.\u201d","The Jewish leaders were puzzled by this statement. \u201cWhere is he planning to go?\u201d they asked. \u201cIs he thinking of leaving the country and going to the Jews in other lands? Maybe he will even teach the Greeks!","On the last day
 the climax of the festival
 Jesus stood and shouted to the crowds
 \u201cAnyone who is thirsty may come to me!","Anyone who believes in me may come and drink! For the Scriptures declare
 \u2018Rivers of living water will flow from his heart.\u2019\u201d","(When he said \u201cliving water
\u201d he was speaking of the Spirit
 who would be given to everyone believing in him. But the Spirit had not yet been given
 because Jesus had not yet entered into his glory.)","\u201cTeacher
\u201d they said to Jesus
 \u201cthis woman was caught in the act of adultery.","They kept demanding an answer
 so he stood up again and said
 \u201cAll right
 but let the one who has never sinned throw the first stone!\u201d","Then Jesus stood up again and said to the woman
 \u201cWhere are your accusers? Didn\u2019t even one of them condemn you?\u201d","\u201cNo
 Lord
\u201d she said. And Jesus said
 \u201cNeither do I. Go and sin no more.\u201d","Jesus spoke to the people once more and said
 \u201cI am the light of the world. If you follow me
 you won\u2019t have to walk in darkness
 because you will have the light that leads to life.\u201d","Jesus told them
 \u201cThese claims are valid even though I make them about myself. For I know where I came from and where I am going
 but you don\u2019t know this about me.","You judge me by human standards
 but I do not judge anyone.","And if I did
 my judgment would be correct in every respect because I am not alone. The Father who sent me is with me.","Your own law says that if two people agree about something
 their witness is accepted as fact.","I am one witness
 and my Father who sent me is the other.\u201d","\u201cWhere is your father?\u201d they asked. Jesus answered
 \u201cSince you don\u2019t know who I am
 you don\u2019t know who my Father is. If you knew me
 you would also know my Father.\u201d","Later Jesus said to them again
 \u201cI am going away. You will search for me but will die in your sin. You cannot come where I am going.\u201d","Jesus continued
 \u201cYou are from below; I am from above. You belong to this world; I do not.","That is why I said that you will die in your sins; for unless you believe that I am who I claim to be
 you will die in your sins.\u201d","\u201cWho are you?\u201d they demanded. Jesus replied
 \u201cThe one I have always claimed to be.","I have much to say about you and much to condemn
 but I won\u2019t. For I say only what I have heard from the one who sent me
 and he is completely truthful.\u201d","So Jesus said
 \u201cWhen you have lifted up the Son of Man on the cross
 then you will understand that I am he. I do nothing on my own but say only what the Father taught me.","And the one who sent me is with me\u2014he has not deserted me. For I always do what pleases him.\u201d","Jesus said to the people who believed in him
 \u201cYou are truly my disciples if you remain faithful to my teachings.","And you will know the truth
 and the truth will set you free.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cI tell you the truth
 everyone who sins is a slave of sin.","A slave is not a permanent member of the family
 but a son is part of the family forever.","So if the Son sets you free
 you are truly free.","Yes
 I realize that you are descendants of Abraham. And yet some of you are trying to kill me because there\u2019s no room in your hearts for my message.","I am telling you what I saw when I was with my Father. But you are following the advice of your father.\u201d","\u201cOur father is Abraham!\u201d they declared. \u201cNo
\u201d Jesus replied
 \u201cfor if you were really the children of Abraham
 you would follow his example.","Instead
 you are trying to kill me because I told you the truth
 which I heard from God. Abraham never did such a thing.","No
 you are imitating your real father.\u201d They replied
 \u201cWe aren\u2019t illegitimate children! God himself is our true Father.\u201d","Jesus told them
 \u201cIf God were your Father
 you would love me
 because I have come to you from God. I am not here on my own
 but he sent me.","Why can\u2019t you understand what I am saying? It\u2019s because you can\u2019t even hear me!","For you are the children of your father the devil
 and you love to do the evil things he does. He was a murderer from the beginning. He has always hated the truth
 because there is no truth in him. When he lies
 it is consistent with his character; for he is a liar and the father of lies.","So when I tell the truth
 you just naturally don\u2019t believe me!","Which of you can truthfully accuse me of sin? And since I am telling you the truth
 why don\u2019t you believe me?","Anyone who belongs to God listens gladly to the words of God. But you don\u2019t listen because you don\u2019t belong to God.\u201d","\u201cNo
\u201d Jesus said
 \u201cI have no demon in me. For I honor my Father\u2014and you dishonor me.","And though I have no wish to glorify myself
 God is going to glorify me. He is the true judge.","I tell you the truth
 anyone who obeys my teaching will never die!\u201d","The people said
 \u201cNow we know you are possessed by a demon. Even Abraham and the prophets died
 but you say
 \u2018Anyone who obeys my teaching will never die!\u2019","Jesus answered
 \u201cIf I want glory for myself
 it doesn\u2019t count. But it is my Father who will glorify me. You say
 \u2018He is our God
\u2019","but you don\u2019t even know him. I know him. If I said otherwise
 I would be as great a liar as you! But I do know him and obey him.","Your father Abraham rejoiced as he looked forward to my coming. He saw it and was glad.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cI tell you the truth
 before Abraham was even born
 I am!\u201d","\u201cIt was not because of his sins or his parents\u2019 sins
\u201d Jesus answered. \u201cThis happened so the power of God could be seen in him.","We must quickly carry out the tasks assigned us by the one who sent us. The night is coming
 and then no one can work.","But while I am here in the world
 I am the light of the world.\u201d","He told him
 \u201cGo wash yourself in the pool of Siloam\u201d (Siloam means \u201csent\u201d). So the man went and washed and came back seeing!","He told them
 \u201cThe man they call Jesus made mud and spread it over my eyes and told me
 \u2018Go to the pool of Siloam and wash yourself.\u2019 So I went and washed
 and now I can see!\u201d","\u201cWhere is he now?\u201d they asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know
\u201d he replied.","So for the second time they called in the man who had been blind and told him
 \u201cGod should get the glory for this
 because we know this man Jesus is a sinner.\u201d","\u201cI don\u2019t know whether he is a sinner
\u201d the man replied. \u201cBut I know this: I was blind
 and now I can see!\u201d","\u201cBut what did he do?\u201d they asked. \u201cHow did he heal you?\u201d","\u201cLook!\u201d the man exclaimed. \u201cI told you once. Didn\u2019t you listen? Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his disciples
 too?\u201d","When Jesus heard what had happened
 he found the man and asked
 \u201cDo you believe in the Son of Man?\u201d","\u201cYou have seen him
\u201d Jesus said
 \u201cand he is speaking to you!\u201d","Then Jesus told him
 \u201cI entered this world to render judgment\u2014to give sight to the blind and to show those who think they see that they are blind.\u201d","\u201cIf you were blind
 you wouldn\u2019t be guilty
\u201d Jesus replied. \u201cBut you remain guilty because you claim you can see.","\u201cI tell you the truth
 anyone who sneaks over the wall of a sheepfold
 rather than going through the gate
 must surely be a thief and a robber!","But the one who enters through the gate is the shepherd of the sheep.","The gatekeeper opens the gate for him
 and the sheep recognize his voice and come to him. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.","After he has gathered his own flock
 he walks ahead of them
 and they follow him because they know his voice.","They won\u2019t follow a stranger; they will run from him because they don\u2019t know his voice.\u201d","so he explained it to them: \u201cI tell you the truth
 I am the gate for the sheep.","All who came before me were thieves and robbers. But the true sheep did not listen to them.","Yes
 I am the gate. Those who come in through me will be saved. They will come and go freely and will find good pastures.","The thief\u2019s purpose is to steal and kill and destroy. My purpose is to give them a rich and satisfying life.","\u201cI am the good shepherd. The good shepherd sacrifices his life for the sheep.","A hired hand will run when he sees a wolf coming. He will abandon the sheep because they don\u2019t belong to him and he isn\u2019t their shepherd. And so the wolf attacks them and scatters the flock.","The hired hand runs away because he\u2019s working only for the money and doesn\u2019t really care about the sheep.","\u201cI am the good shepherd; I know my own sheep
 and they know me
","just as my Father knows me and I know the Father. So I sacrifice my life for the sheep.","I have other sheep
 too
 that are not in this sheepfold. I must bring them also. They will listen to my voice
 and there will be one flock with one shepherd.","\u201cThe Father loves me because I sacrifice my life so I may take it back again.","No one can take my life from me. I sacrifice it voluntarily. For I have the authority to lay it down when I want to and also to take it up again. For this is what my Father has commanded.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cI have already told you
 and you don\u2019t believe me. The proof is the work I do in my Father\u2019s name.","But you don\u2019t believe me because you are not my sheep.","My sheep listen to my voice; I know them
 and they follow me.","I give them eternal life
 and they will never perish. No one can snatch them away from me
","for my Father has given them to me
 and he is more powerful than anyone else. No one can snatch them from the Father\u2019s hand.","The Father and I are one.\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cAt my Father\u2019s direction I have done many good works. For which one are you going to stone me?\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cIt is written in your own Scriptures that God said to certain leaders of the people
 \u2018I say
 you are gods!\u2019","And you know that the Scriptures cannot be altered. So if those people who received God\u2019s message were called \u2018gods
\u2019","why do you call it blasphemy when I say
 \u2018I am the Son of God\u2019? After all
 the Father set me apart and sent me into the world.","Don\u2019t believe me unless I carry out my Father\u2019s work.","But if I do his work
 believe in the evidence of the miraculous works I have done
 even if you don\u2019t believe me. Then you will know and understand that the Father is in me
 and I am in the Father.\u201d","But when Jesus heard about it he said
 \u201cLazarus\u2019s sickness will not end in death. No
 it happened for the glory of God so that the Son of God will receive glory from this.\u201d","Finally
 he said to his disciples
 \u201cLet\u2019s go back to Judea.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cThere are twelve hours of daylight every day. During the day people can walk safely. They can see because they have the light of this world.","But at night there is danger of stumbling because they have no light.\u201d","Then he said
 \u201cOur friend Lazarus has fallen asleep
 but now I will go and wake him up.\u201d","So he told them plainly
 \u201cLazarus is dead.","And for your sakes
 I\u2019m glad I wasn\u2019t there
 for now you will really believe. Come
 let\u2019s go see him.\u201d","Thomas
 nicknamed the Twin
 said to his fellow disciples
 \u201cLet\u2019s go
 too\u2014and die with Jesus.\u201d","Jesus told her
 \u201cYour brother will rise again.\u201d","Jesus told her
 \u201cI am the resurrection and the life. Anyone who believes in me will live
 even after dying.","Everyone who lives in me and believes in me will never ever die. Do you believe this
 Martha?\u201d","\u201cYes
 Lord
\u201d she told him. \u201cI have always believed you are the Messiah
 the Son of God
 the one who has come into the world from God.\u201d","When Mary arrived and saw Jesus
 she fell at his feet and said
 \u201cLord
 if only you had been here
 my brother would not have died.\u201d","\u201cWhere have you put him?\u201d he asked them. They told him
 \u201cLord
 come and see.\u201d","\u201cRoll the stone aside
\u201d Jesus told them. But Martha
 the dead man\u2019s sister
 protested
 \u201cLord
 he has been dead for four days. The smell will be terrible.\u201d","Jesus responded
 \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you that you would see God\u2019s glory if you believe?\u201d","So they rolled the stone aside. Then Jesus looked up to heaven and said
 \u201cFather
 thank you for hearing me.","You always hear me
 but I said it out loud for the sake of all these people standing here
 so that they will believe you sent me.\u201d","Then Jesus shouted
 \u201cLazarus
 come out!\u201d","And the dead man came out
 his hands and feet bound in graveclothes
 his face wrapped in a headcloth. Jesus told them
 \u201cUnwrap him and let him go!\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cLeave her alone. She did this in preparation for my burial.","You will always have the poor among you
 but you will not always have me.\u201d","Many in the crowd had seen Jesus call Lazarus from the tomb
 raising him from the dead
 and they were telling others about it.","Then the Pharisees said to each other
 \u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do. Look
 everyone has gone after him!\u201d","paid a visit to Philip
 who was from Bethsaida in Galilee. They said
 \u201cSir
 we want to meet Jesus.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cNow the time has come for the Son of Man to enter into his glory.","I tell you the truth
 unless a kernel of wheat is planted in the soil and dies
 it remains alone. But its death will produce many new kernels\u2014a plentiful harvest of new lives.","Those who love their life in this world will lose it. Those who care nothing for their life in this world will keep it for eternity.","Anyone who wants to serve me must follow me
 because my servants must be where I am. And the Father will honor anyone who serves me.","\u201cNow my soul is deeply troubled. Should I pray
 \u2018Father
 save me from this hour\u2019? But this is the very reason I came!","Father
 bring glory to your name.\u201d Then a voice spoke from heaven
 saying
 \u201cI have already brought glory to my name
 and I will do so again.\u201d","Then Jesus told them
 \u201cThe voice was for your benefit
 not mine.","The time for judging this world has come
 when Satan
 the ruler of this world
 will be cast out.","And when I am lifted up from the earth
 I will draw everyone to myself.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cMy light will shine for you just a little longer. Walk in the light while you can
 so the darkness will not overtake you. Those who walk in the darkness cannot see where they are going.","Put your trust in the light while there is still time; then you will become children of the light.\u201d After saying these things
 Jesus went away and was hidden from them.","Jesus shouted to the crowds
 \u201cIf you trust me
 you are trusting not only me

 you are seeing the one who sent me.","I have come as a light to shine in this dark world

 for I have come to save the world and not to judge it.","But all who reject me and my message will be judged on the day of judgment by the truth I have spoken.","I don\u2019t speak on my own authority. The Father who sent me has commanded me what to say and how to say it.","And I know his commands lead to eternal life; so I say whatever the Father tells me to say.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cYou don\u2019t understand now what I am doing
 but someday you will.\u201d","\u201cNo
\u201d Peter protested
 \u201cyou will never ever wash my feet!\u201d Jesus replied
 \u201cUnless I wash you
 you won\u2019t belong to me.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cA person who has bathed all over does not need to wash
 except for the feet
 to be entirely clean. And you disciples are clean
 but not all of you.\u201d","For Jesus knew who would betray him. That is what he meant when he said
 \u201cNot all of you are clean.\u201d","After washing their feet
 he put on his robe again and sat down and asked
 \u201cDo you understand what I was doing?","You call me \u2018Teacher\u2019 and \u2018Lord
\u2019 and you are right
 because that\u2019s what I am.","And since I
 your Lord and Teacher
 have washed your feet
 you ought to wash each other\u2019s feet.","I have given you an example to follow. Do as I have done to you.","I tell you the truth
 slaves are not greater than their master. Nor is the messenger more important than the one who sends the message.","Now that you know these things
 God will bless you for doing them.","\u201cI am not saying these things to all of you; I know the ones I have chosen. But this fulfills the Scripture that says
 \u2018The one who eats my food has turned against me.\u2019","I tell you this beforehand
 so that when it happens you will believe that I am the Messiah.","I tell you the truth
 anyone who welcomes my messenger is welcoming me
 and anyone who welcomes me is welcoming the Father who sent me.\u201d","Now Jesus was deeply troubled
 and he exclaimed
 \u201cI tell you the truth
 one of you will betray me!\u201d","Jesus responded
 \u201cIt is the one to whom I give the bread I dip in the bowl.\u201d And when he had dipped it
 he gave it to Judas
 son of Simon Iscariot.","When Judas had eaten the bread
 Satan entered into him. Then Jesus told him
 \u201cHurry and do what you\u2019re going to do.\u201d","As soon as Judas left the room
 Jesus said
 \u201cThe time has come for the Son of Man to enter into his glory
 and God will be glorified because of him.","And since God receives glory because of the Son
 he will give his own glory to the Son
 and he will do so at once.","Dear children
 I will be with you only a little longer. And as I told the Jewish leaders
 you will search for me
 but you can\u2019t come where I am going.","So now I am giving you a new commandment: Love each other. Just as I have loved you
 you should love each other.","Your love for one another will prove to the world that you are my disciples.\u201d","Simon Peter asked
 \u201cLord
 where are you going?\u201d And Jesus replied
 \u201cYou can\u2019t go with me now
 but you will follow me later.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cDie for me? I tell you the truth
 Peter\u2014before the rooster crows tomorrow morning
 you will deny three times that you even know me.","\u201cDon\u2019t let your hearts be troubled. Trust in God
 and trust also in me.","There is more than enough room in my Father\u2019s home. If this were not so
 would I have told you that I am going to prepare a place for you?","When everything is ready
 I will come and get you
 so that you will always be with me where I am.","And you know the way to where I am going.\u201d","Jesus told him
 \u201cI am the way
 the truth
 and the life. No one can come to the Father except through me.","If you had really known me
 you would know who my Father is. From now on
 you do know him and have seen him!\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cHave I been with you all this time
 Philip
 and yet you still don\u2019t know who I am? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father! So why are you asking me to show him to you?","Don\u2019t you believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words I speak are not my own
 but my Father who lives in me does his work through me.","Just believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me. Or at least believe because of the work you have seen me do.","\u201cI tell you the truth
 anyone who believes in me will do the same works I have done
 and even greater works
 because I am going to be with the Father.","You can ask for anything in my name
 and I will do it
 so that the Son can bring glory to the Father.","Yes
 ask me for anything in my name
 and I will do it!","\u201cIf you love me
 obey my commandments.","And I will ask the Father
 and he will give you another Advocate
 who will never leave you.","He is the Holy Spirit
 who leads into all truth. The world cannot receive him
 because it isn\u2019t looking for him and doesn\u2019t recognize him. But you know him
 because he lives with you now and later will be in you.","No
 I will not abandon you as orphans\u2014I will come to you.","Soon the world will no longer see me
 but you will see me. Since I live
 you also will live.","When I am raised to life again
 you will know that I am in my Father
 and you are in me
 and I am in you.","Those who accept my commandments and obey them are the ones who love me. And because they love me
 my Father will love them. And I will love them and reveal myself to each of them.\u201d","Judas (not Judas Iscariot
 but the other disciple with that name) said to him
 \u201cLord
 why are you going to reveal yourself only to us and not to the world at large?\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cAll who love me will do what I say. My Father will love them
 and we will come and make our home with each of them.","Anyone who doesn\u2019t love me will not obey me. And remember
 my words are not my own. What I am telling you is from the Father who sent me.","I am telling you these things now while I am still with you.","But when the Father sends the Advocate as my representative\u2014that is
 the Holy Spirit\u2014he will teach you everything and will remind you of everything I have told you.","\u201cI am leaving you with a gift\u2014peace of mind and heart. And the peace I give is a gift the world cannot give. So don\u2019t be troubled or afraid.","Remember what I told you: I am going away
 but I will come back to you again. If you really loved me
 you would be happy that I am going to the Father
 who is greater than I am.","I have told you these things before they happen so that when they do happen
 you will believe.","\u201cI don\u2019t have much more time to talk to you
 because the ruler of this world approaches. He has no power over me
","but I will do what the Father requires of me
 so that the world will know that I love the Father. Come
 let\u2019s be going.","\u201cI am the true grapevine
 and my Father is the gardener.","He cuts off every branch of mine that doesn\u2019t produce fruit
 and he prunes the branches that do bear fruit so they will produce even more.","You have already been pruned and purified by the message I have given you.","Remain in me
 and I will remain in you. For a branch cannot produce fruit if it is severed from the vine
 and you cannot be fruitful unless you remain in me.","\u201cYes
 I am the vine; you are the branches. Those who remain in me
 and I in them
 will produce much fruit. For apart from me you can do nothing.","Anyone who does not remain in me is thrown away like a useless branch and withers. Such branches are gathered into a pile to be burned.","But if you remain in me and my words remain in you
 you may ask for anything you want
 and it will be granted!","When you produce much fruit
 you are my true disciples. This brings great glory to my Father.","\u201cI have loved you even as the Father has loved me. Remain in my love.","When you obey my commandments
 you remain in my love
 just as I obey my Father\u2019s commandments and remain in his love.","I have told you these things so that you will be filled with my joy. Yes
 your joy will overflow!","This is my commandment: Love each other in the same way I have loved you.","There is no greater love than to lay down one\u2019s life for one\u2019s friends.","You are my friends if you do what I command.","I no longer call you slaves
 because a master doesn\u2019t confide in his slaves. Now you are my friends
 since I have told you everything the Father told me.","You didn\u2019t choose me. I chose you. I appointed you to go and produce lasting fruit
 so that the Father will give you whatever you ask for
 using my name.","This is my command: Love each other.","\u201cIf the world hates you
 remember that it hated me first.","The world would love you as one of its own if you belonged to it
 but you are no longer part of the world. I chose you to come out of the world
 so it hates you.","Do you remember what I told you? \u2018A slave is not greater than the master.\u2019 Since they persecuted me
 naturally they will persecute you. And if they had listened to me
 they would listen to you.","They will do all this to you because of me
 for they have rejected the one who sent me.","They would not be guilty if I had not come and spoken to them. But now they have no excuse for their sin.","Anyone who hates me also hates my Father.","If I hadn\u2019t done such miraculous signs among them that no one else could do
 they would not be guilty. But as it is
 they have seen everything I did
 yet they still hate me and my Father.","This fulfills what is written in their Scriptures: \u2018They hated me without cause.\u2019","\u201cBut I will send you the Advocate\u2014the Spirit of truth. He will come to you from the Father and will testify all about me.","And you must also testify about me because you have been with me from the beginning of my ministry.","\u201cI have told you these things so that you won\u2019t abandon your faith.","For you will be expelled from the synagogues
 and the time is coming when those who kill you will think they are doing a holy service for God.","This is because they have never known the Father or me.","Yes
 I\u2019m telling you these things now
 so that when they happen
 you will remember my warning. I didn\u2019t tell you earlier because I was going to be with you for a while longer.","\u201cBut now I am going away to the one who sent me
 and not one of you is asking where I am going.","Instead
 you grieve because of what I\u2019ve told you.","But in fact
 it is best for you that I go away
 because if I don\u2019t
 the Advocate won\u2019t come. If I do go away
 then I will send him to you.","And when he comes
 he will convict the world of its sin
 and of God\u2019s righteousness
 and of the coming judgment.","The world\u2019s sin is that it refuses to believe in me.","Righteousness is available because I go to the Father
 and you will see me no more.","Judgment will come because the ruler of this world has already been judged.","\u201cThere is so much more I want to tell you
 but you can\u2019t bear it now.","When the Spirit of truth comes
 he will guide you into all truth. He will not speak on his own but will tell you what he has heard. He will tell you about the future.","He will bring me glory by telling you whatever he receives from me.","All that belongs to the Father is mine; this is why I said
 \u2018The Spirit will tell you whatever he receives from me.\u2019","\u201cIn a little while you won\u2019t see me anymore. But a little while after that
 you will see me again.\u201d","Some of the disciples asked each other
 \u201cWhat does he mean when he says
 \u2018In a little while you won\u2019t see me
 but then you will see me
\u2019 and \u2018I am going to the Father\u2019?","And what does he mean by \u2018a little while\u2019? We don\u2019t understand.\u201d","Jesus realized they wanted to ask him about it
 so he said
 \u201cAre you asking yourselves what I meant? I said in a little while you won\u2019t see me
 but a little while after that you will see me again.","I tell you the truth
 you will weep and mourn over what is going to happen to me
 but the world will rejoice. You will grieve
 but your grief will suddenly turn to wonderful joy.","It will be like a woman suffering the pains of labor. When her child is born
 her anguish gives way to joy because she has brought a new baby into the world.","So you have sorrow now
 but I will see you again; then you will rejoice
 and no one can rob you of that joy.","At that time you won\u2019t need to ask me for anything. I tell you the truth
 you will ask the Father directly
 and he will grant your request because you use my name.","You haven\u2019t done this before. Ask
 using my name
 and you will receive
 and you will have abundant joy.","\u201cI have spoken of these matters in figures of speech
 but soon I will stop speaking figuratively and will tell you plainly all about the Father.","Then you will ask in my name. I\u2019m not saying I will ask the Father on your behalf
","for the Father himself loves you dearly because you love me and believe that I came from God.","Yes
 I came from the Father into the world
 and now I will leave the world and return to the Father.\u201d","Jesus asked
 \u201cDo you finally believe?","But the time is coming\u2014indeed it\u2019s here now\u2014when you will be scattered
 each one going his own way
 leaving me alone. Yet I am not alone because the Father is with me.","I have told you all this so that you may have peace in me. Here on earth you will have many trials and sorrows. But take heart
 because I have overcome the world.\u201d","After saying all these things
 Jesus looked up to heaven and said
 \u201cFather
 the hour has come. Glorify your Son so he can give glory back to you.","For you have given him authority over everyone. He gives eternal life to each one you have given him.","And this is the way to have eternal life\u2014to know you
 the only true God
 and Jesus Christ
 the one you sent to earth.","I brought glory to you here on earth by completing the work you gave me to do.","Now
 Father
 bring me into the glory we shared before the world began.","\u201cI have revealed you to the ones you gave me from this world. They were always yours. You gave them to me
 and they have kept your word.","Now they know that everything I have is a gift from you
","for I have passed on to them the message you gave me. They accepted it and know that I came from you
 and they believe you sent me.","\u201cMy prayer is not for the world
 but for those you have given me
 because they belong to you.","All who are mine belong to you
 and you have given them to me
 so they bring me glory.","Now I am departing from the world; they are staying in this world
 but I am coming to you. Holy Father
 you have given me your name; now protect them by the power of your name so that they will be united just as we are.","During my time here
 I protected them by the power of the name you gave me. I guarded them so that not one was lost
 except the one headed for destruction
 as the Scriptures foretold.","\u201cNow I am coming to you. I told them many things while I was with them in this world so they would be filled with my joy.","I have given them your word. And the world hates them because they do not belong to the world
 just as I do not belong to the world.","I\u2019m not asking you to take them out of the world
 but to keep them safe from the evil one.","They do not belong to this world any more than I do.","Make them holy by your truth; teach them your word
 which is truth.","Just as you sent me into the world
 I am sending them into the world.","And I give myself as a holy sacrifice for them so they can be made holy by your truth.","\u201cI am praying not only for these disciples but also for all who will ever believe in me through their message.","I pray that they will all be one
 just as you and I are one\u2014as you are in me
 Father
 and I am in you. And may they be in us so that the world will believe you sent me.","\u201cI have given them the glory you gave me
 so they may be one as we are one.","I am in them and you are in me. May they experience such perfect unity that the world will know that you sent me and that you love them as much as you love me.","Father
 I want these whom you have given me to be with me where I am. Then they can see all the glory you gave me because you loved me even before the world began!","\u201cO righteous Father
 the world doesn\u2019t know you
 but I do; and these disciples know you sent me.","I have revealed you to them
 and I will continue to do so. Then your love for me will be in them
 and I will be in them.\u201d","Jesus fully realized all that was going to happen to him
 so he stepped forward to meet them. \u201cWho are you looking for?\u201d he asked.","\u201cJesus the Nazarene
\u201d they replied. \u201cI am he
\u201d Jesus said. (Judas
 who betrayed him
 was standing with them.)","As Jesus said \u201cI am he
\u201d they all drew back and fell to the ground!","Once more he asked them
 \u201cWho are you looking for?\u201d And again they replied
 \u201cJesus the Nazarene.\u201d","\u201cI told you that I am he

 let these others go.\u201d","But Jesus said to Peter
 \u201cPut your sword back into its sheath. Shall I not drink from the cup of suffering the Father has given me?\u201d","The woman asked Peter
 \u201cYou\u2019re not one of that man\u2019s disciples
 are you?\u201d \u201cNo
\u201d he said
 \u201cI am not.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cEveryone knows what I teach. I have preached regularly in the synagogues and the Temple
 where the people gather. I have not spoken in secret.","Why are you asking me this question? Ask those who heard me. They know what I said.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cIf I said anything wrong
 you must prove it. But if I\u2019m speaking the truth
 why are you beating me?\u201d","\u201cThen take him away and judge him by your own law
\u201d Pilate told them. \u201cOnly the Romans are permitted to execute someone
\u201d the Jewish leaders replied.","Jesus replied
 \u201cIs this your own question
 or did others tell you about me?\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cMy Kingdom is not an earthly kingdom. If it were
 my followers would fight to keep me from being handed over to the Jewish leaders. But my Kingdom is not of this world.\u201d","Pilate said
 \u201cSo you are a king?\u201d Jesus responded
 \u201cYou say I am a king. Actually
 I was born and came into the world to testify to the truth. All who love the truth recognize that what I say is true.\u201d","Pilate went outside again and said to the people
 \u201cI am going to bring him out to you now
 but understand clearly that I find him not guilty.\u201d","Then Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. And Pilate said
 \u201cLook
 here is the man!\u201d","When they saw him
 the leading priests and Temple guards began shouting
 \u201cCrucify him! Crucify him!\u201d \u201cTake him yourselves and crucify him
\u201d Pilate said. \u201cI find him not guilty.\u201d","Then Jesus said
 \u201cYou would have no power over me at all unless it were given to you from above. So the one who handed me over to you has the greater sin.\u201d","It was now about noon on the day of preparation for the Passover. And Pilate said to the people
 \u201cLook
 here is your king!\u201d","When Jesus saw his mother standing there beside the disciple he loved
 he said to her
 \u201cDear woman
 here is your son.\u201d","And he said to this disciple
 \u201cHere is your mother.\u201d And from then on this disciple took her into his home.","Jesus knew that his mission was now finished
 and to fulfill Scripture he said
 \u201cI am thirsty.\u201d","When Jesus had tasted it
 he said
 \u201cIt is finished!\u201d Then he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.","She ran and found Simon Peter and the other disciple

 he cannot get into the holy nation of God. ","Whatever is born of the flesh is flesh. Whatever is born of the Spirit is spirit.","\u201cDo not be surprised that I said to you
 \u2018You must be born again.\u2019 ","The wind blows where it wants to and you hear its sound. You do not know where it comes from or where it goes. It is the same with everyone who is born of the Spirit of God.\u201d","Jesus said

That One is the Son of Man *Who is in heaven.","As Moses lifted up the snake in the desert
 so the Son of Man must be lifted up. ","Then whoever puts his trust in Him will have life that lasts forever.","For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son. Whoever puts his trust in God\u2019s Son will not be lost but will have life that lasts forever.","For God did not send His Son into the world to say it is guilty. He sent His Son so the world might be saved from the punishment of sin by Him.","Whoever puts his trust in His Son is not guilty. Whoever does not put his trust in Him is guilty already. It is because he does not put his trust in the name of the only Son of God.","\u201cThe Light has come into the world. And the Light is the test by which men are guilty or not. People love darkness more than the Light because the things they do are sinful.","Everyone who sins hates the Light.

What he does will be seen because he has done what God wanted him to do.\u201d","They came to John and said to him

 He called with a loud voice
 \u201cLazarus

 \u201cTake off the grave clothes and let him go!\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cLet her alone. She has kept it for the time when I will be buried. ","You will always have poor people with you.

 \u201cThe hour is near for the Son of Man to be taken to heaven to receive great honor. ","For sure
 I tell you
 unless a seed falls into the ground and dies
 it will only be a seed. If it dies
 it will give much grain. ","Anyone who loves his life will lose it. Anyone who hates his life in this world will keep it forever.","If anyone wants to serve Me
 he must follow Me. So where I am
 the one who wants to serve Me will be there also. If anyone serves Me
 My Father will honor him. ","\u201cNow My soul is troubled. Should I say

 I will attract all people toward Me.\u201d ","Jesus said to them

 he does not know where he is going. ","While you have the Light
 put your trust in the Light. Then you will be the sons of the Light.\u201d Jesus said these things and then went away. He hid Himself from them.","Then Jesus spoke with a loud voice

 you will be happy if you do them. ","\u201cI am not speaking about all of you. I know the ones I have chosen. What is written in the Holy Writings must happen. It says

 What then? Are you Elijah?","Then said they to him
 Who are you
 so that we may give an answer to those who sent us: what do you say about yourself?","He said
 I am the voice of a crier in the wilderness
 Make straight the way of the Lord! as the prophet Isaiah said.","And Jesus turned about and saw them following and said to them
 What are you seeking? They said to him
 Rabbi (which means
 Teacher)
 where are you staying? ","He said to them
 Come and see.","And he brought him to Jesus. And Jesus regarded him and said
 You are Simon
 the son of Jonah. You shall be called Cephas (which translated is
 a rock).","The day following
 Jesus decided to go into Galilee. And he found Philip and said to him
 Follow me. ","And Philip found Nathanael and said to him
 We have found him of whom Moses in the law and the prophets did write: Jesus
 the son of Joseph of Nazareth. ","And Nathanael said to him
 Can any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip said to him
 Come and see.","Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him and said of him
 Behold a right Israelite
 in whom there is no guile. ","Nathanael said to him
 Where did you know me? Jesus answered and said to him
 Before Philip called you
 when you were under the fig tree
 I saw you. ","Jesus answered and said to him
 Because I said to you
 I saw you under the fig tree
 you believe. You will see greater things than these.","And he said to him
 Truly truly I say to you
 hereafter you shall see heaven open
 and the angels of God ascending and descending over the Son of man.","Jesus said to her
 Woman
 what have I to do with you? My hour is not yet come. ","And Jesus said to them
 Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim. ","And he said to them
 Draw some out now
 and bring it to the master of the feast. And they brought it.","and said to those who sold doves
 Take these things away from here
 and do not make my Father\u2019s house a house of merchandise! ","Jesus answered and said to them
 Destroy this temple
 and in three days I will rear it up again.","Jesus answered and said to him
 Truly truly I say to you
 unless a man be born anew
 he cannot see the kingdom of God.","Jesus answered
 Truly truly I say to you
 unless a man be born of water and of the Spirit
 he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. ","That which is born of the flesh is flesh
 and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. ","Marvel not that I said to you
 you must be born anew. ","The wind blows where it will
 and you hear its sound
 but cannot tell from whence it comes and where it goes. That is how it is with everyone that is born of the Spirit.","Jesus answered and said to him
 Are you a teacher in Israel
 and do not know these things? ","Truly truly I say to you
 we speak what we know
 and testify what we have seen
 and you people do not receive our witness. ","If when I tell you all earthly things
 you do not believe
 how will you believe if I tell you of heavenly things? ","And no man ascends up to heaven but he who came down from heaven; that is to say
 the Son of man who is in heaven. ","And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness
 even so must the Son of man be lifted up
 ","so that no one who believes in him will perish
 but will have eternal life.","For God so loves the world
 that he has given his only Son
 so that none who believe in him should perish
 but should have everlasting life. ","For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world
 but so that the world through him could be saved. ","Whoever believes on him shall not be condemned. But whoever does not believe is condemned already
 because he does not believe in the name of the only Son of God. ","And this is the condemnation: that light has come into the world
 and men loved darkness more than light
 because their deeds were evil. ","For everyone who does evil hates the light
 and does not come to the light
 lest his deeds should be reproved. ","But whoever does truth comes to the light
 so that his deeds may be known
 that they are wrought in God.","And they came to John and said to him
 Rabbi
 he who was with you beyond the Jordan
 of whom you bear witness
 behold
 he is baptizing
 and everyone is going to him.","and there came a woman of Samaria to draw water. And Jesus said to her
 Give me to drink. ","Jesus answered and said to her
 If you knew the gift of God
 and who it is that says to you
 Give me to drink
 you would have asked of him
 and he would have given you the water of life.","Jesus answered and said to her
 Whoever drinks of this water will thirst again. ","But whoever drinks of the water that I give him shall never more thirst
 but the water that I give him will be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.","The woman said to him
 Sir
 give me of that water so that I may not thirst
 nor come here to draw. ","Jesus said to her
 Go and call your husband
 and come here. ","The woman answered and said to him
 I have no husband. Jesus said to her
 You have well said
 I have no husband. ","For you have had five husbands
 and he whom you now have is not your husband. This you have said truly.","Jesus said to her
 Woman
 believe me
 the hour is coming when you will neither in this mountain
 nor yet at Jerusalem
 worship the Father. ","You Samaritans worship you know not what. We know what we worship
 for salvation comes of the Jews. ","But the hour comes
 and now is
 when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth. For indeed
 the Father seeks such to worship him. ","God is a spirit
 and those who worship him must worship him in spirit and truth.","Jesus said to her
 I who speak to you am he.","He said to them
 I have food to eat that you know not of. ","Jesus said to them
 My food is to do the will of him who sent me
 and to finish his work. ","Do you not say
 There are yet four months
 and then comes the harvest? Behold
 I say to you
 lift up your eyes and look on the fields
 for they are already white for harvest. ","And he who reaps receives reward
 and gathers fruit unto life eternal
 so that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together. ","And this saying is true
 that one sows and another reaps. ","I sent you to reap that whereon you bestowed no labour. Other men laboured
 and you have entered into their labours.","and said to the woman
 Now we believe
 not because of what you said
 but because we have heard him ourselves
 and know that this is even indeed Christ
 the Saviour of the world.","Then Jesus said to him
 Unless you see signs and wonders
 you cannot believe. ","Jesus said to him
 Go your way
 your son lives.","Then he enquired of them the hour when the child began to recover. And they said to him
 Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him. ","And the father knew that it was the same hour in which Jesus had said to him
 Your son lives. And he believed
 and all his household. ","When Jesus saw him lying there
 and knew that for a long time now he had been diseased
 he said to him
 Do you want to be made whole? ","And Jesus said to him
 Rise
 take up your bed
 and walk. ","He answered them
 The man who made me whole said to me
 Take up your bed and walk. ","And after that
 Jesus found the man in the temple and said to him
 Behold
 you are made whole. Sin no more
 lest a worse thing happen to you. ","And Jesus told them
 My Father works until now
 and I work.","Then Jesus said to them
 Truly truly I say to you
 the Son can do nothing of himself
 but that which he sees the Father do. For whatsoever he does
 that the Son does also. ","For the Father loves the Son
 and shows him all things
 whatever he himself does. And he will show him greater works than these
 because you should marvel. ","For likewise as the Father raises up the dead and gives them life
 even so the Son gives life to whom he will. ","Neither does the Father judge any man
 but has committed all judgment to the Son
 ","because all should honour the Son fully as they honour the Father. He who does not honour the Son
 does not honour the Father who has sent him. ","Truly truly I say to you
 he who hears my words and believes on him who sent me
 has everlasting life
 and shall not come into damnation
 but is escaped from death to life.","Truly truly I say to you
 the time shall come
 and now is
 when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God. And those who hear will live. ","For as the Father has life in himself
 so likewise has he given to the Son to have life in himself
 ","and has given him power also to judge
 in that he is the Son of man. ","Do not be surprised at this. And the hour shall come in which all who are in the graves will hear his voice
 ","and will come forth \u2013 those who have done good to the resurrection of life
 and those who have done evil
 to the resurrection of damnation.","I can of my own self do nothing at all. As I hear
 I judge. And my judgment is just
 because I seek not my own will
 but the will of the Father who has sent me.","If I bear witness of myself
 my witness is not true. ","There is another who bears witness of me
 and I know that the witness he bears of me is true: ","you sent to John
 and he bore witness to the truth. ","But I do not need the testimony of man. Nevertheless
 I say these things so that you might be saved. ","He was a burning and a shining light
 and you were willing for a season to enjoy his light.","But I have greater witness than the witness of John. For the works which the Father has given me to finish
 the same works that I do
 bear witness of me
 that the Father sent me.","And the Father himself who has sent me bears witness of me. You have not heard his voice at any time
 nor have you seen his nature
 ","and his words you do not have abiding in you. For whom he has sent
 him you do not believe.","Search the scriptures
 for in them you think you have eternal life
 and it is they that testify of me. ","And yet you will not come to me so that you might have life.","I do not need praise from men
 ","but I know you
 that you do not have the love of God in you. ","I have come in my Father\u2019s name
 and you do not receive me. If another comes in his own name
 him you will receive. ","How can you believe
 who receive honour from one another
 and do not seek the honour that comes from God only?","Do not think that I will accuse you to my Father. There is one who accuses you: even Moses
 in whom you trust. ","For had you believed Moses
 you would have believed me. For he wrote of me. ","But seeing you do not believe his writing
 how will you believe my words?","Then Jesus lifted up his eyes and saw a great crowd coming to him
 and said to Philip
 Where will we buy bread so that these people can eat? ","And Jesus said
 Make the people sit down.","When they had eaten enough
 he said to his disciples
 Gather up the leftover food that remains
 so that nothing is lost. ","And he said to them
 It is I; be not afraid.","Jesus answered them and said
 Truly truly I say to you
 you seek me not because you saw the miracles
 but because you ate of the loaves and were filled.\u00a0 ","Labour not for the food that perishes
 but for the food that endures unto everlasting life
 which food the Son of man will give to you. For him has God the Father sealed.","Jesus answered and said to them
 This is the work of God: to believe on him whom he has sent.","Jesus said to them
 Truly truly I say to you
 Moses did not give you bread from heaven
 but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven. ","For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.","And Jesus said to them
 I am that bread of life. He who comes to me shall not hunger
 and he who believes on me shall never thirst. ","But I said to you that you have seen me
 and yet do not believe. ","All whom the Father gives me shall come to me
 and him who comes to me
 I cast not away. ","For I came down from heaven not to do my own will
 but the will of him who has sent me. ","And this is the will of the Father who has sent me: that of everything that he has given me
 I should lose nothing
 but should raise it up again at the last day. ","And this is the will of him who sent me: that every person who sees the Son and believes on him should have everlasting life. And I will raise him up at the last day.","Jesus answered and said to them
 Do not murmur between yourselves. ","No one can come to me unless the Father who has sent me draws him. And I will raise him up at the last day.","It is written in the prophets that they will all be taught by God. Everyone therefore who has heard and has learned from the Father
 comes to me. ","Not that anyone has seen the Father
 except he who is of God; the same has seen the Father.","Truly truly I say to you
 he who believes on me has everlasting life. ","I am that bread of life.","Your fathers ate manna in the wilderness
 but are dead. ","This is the bread that comes from heaven
 so that one may eat of it and not die. ","I am that living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread
 he will live forever. And the bread that I will give is my flesh
 which I will give for the life of the world.","Then Jesus said to them
 Truly truly I say to you
 unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man
 and drink his blood
 you shall not have life in you. ","Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life
 and I will raise him up at the last day. ","For my flesh is food indeed
 and my blood is drink indeed. ","He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood dwells in me
 and I in him. ","As the living Father has sent me
 even so do I live by my Father
 and he that eats me
 shall live by me. ","This is the bread which came from heaven \u2013 not as your fathers ate manna
 and are dead. He who eats of this bread shall live forever.","Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it
 and said to them
 Does this offend you? ","What if you see the Son of man ascend up to where he was before?","It is the Spirit that quickens. The flesh profits nothing: the words that I speak to you
 are spirit and life. ","But there are some of you who do not believe. (For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that did not believe
 and who would betray him.) ","And he said
 Therefore I said to you that no one can come to me
 unless it be given to him by my Father.","Then Jesus said to the twelve
 Will you also go away? ","Jesus answered them
 Have I not chosen you twelve? And yet one of you is a devil. ","His brethren therefore said to him
 Go on
 and go into Judea
 so that your disciples can see the works that you do. ","Then Jesus said to them
 My time is not yet come
 but your time is always at hand. ","The world cannot hate you
 but me it hates
 because I testify of it that its works are evil. ","You go up to this feast. I will not go up yet to this feast
 for my time is not yet full come.","Jesus answered them and said
 My doctrine is not mine
 but his who sent me. ","If any person desires to do his will
 he will know concerning the doctrine
 whether it is of God or whether I speak of myself. ","He who speaks of himself seeks his own glory. But he who seeks the glory of the one who sent him
 such a person is true
 and no unrighteousness is in him.","Did not Moses give you a law? And yet none of you keeps the law. Why are you going about to kill me?","Jesus answered and said to them
 I have done one work
 and you are all troubled. ","Moses gave you circumcision
 not because it is from Moses
 but from the fathers. And yet you on the Sabbath day circumcise a man. ","If a man on the Sabbath day may receive circumcision without breaking the law of Moses
 do you take offence at me
 because I have made a man every whit whole on the Sabbath day? ","Do not judge according to the outward appearance
 but judge with righteous judgment.","Then some of the people of Jerusalem said
 Is this not the man they are going about to kill? ","Then Jesus cried out in the temple as he taught
 saying
 You know me; and where I am from
 you know. And yet I am not come of myself
 but he who sent me is true
 whom you do not know. ","I know him
 for I am of him
 and he has sent me.","Then Jesus said to them
 Yet a little while I am with you
 and then I go to him who sent me. ","You will seek me
 and will not find me; and where I am
 there you cannot come.","Then the Jews said between themselves
 Where will he go
 that we will not find him? Will he go among the Gentiles
 who are scattered all abroad
 and teach the Gentiles? ","In the last day
 the great day of the feast
 Jesus stood and cried out
 saying
 If anyone thirsts
 let him come unto me and drink. ","He who believes on me
 as says the scripture
 out of his belly shall flow rivers of the water of life.","He spoke this of the Spirit
 which those who believed on him would receive.\u00a0 For the Holy Spirit was not yet there
 because Jesus was not yet glorified. ","and said to him
 Teacher
 this woman was caught in adultery
 even in the act. ","And while they continued asking him
 he lifted himself up and said to them
 Let him who is without sin among you
 cast the first stone at her. ","When Jesus lifted up himself again and saw no one but the woman
 he said to her
 Woman
 where are they
 your accusers? Has no one condemned you? ","She said
 No one
 Lord. And Jesus said
 Neither do I condemn you. Go
 and sin no more.","Then Jesus spoke to them again
 saying
 I am the light of the world. He who follows me shall not walk in darkness
 but will have the light of life. ","Jesus answered and said to them
 Though I bear witness of myself
 yet my witness is true
 for I know where I came from and where I am going. But you do not know where I come from or where I am going. ","You judge after the flesh. I judge no one;","and yet if I do judge
 my judgment is true. For I am not alone
 but it is I and the Father who sent me. ","It is also written in your law that the testimony of two men is true.","I am one who bears witness of myself
 and the Father who sent me bears witness of me.","Then they said to him
 Where is your father?","Then Jesus said again to them
 I go my way; and you will seek me
 and will die in your sins. Where I go
 there you cannot come.","And he said to them
 You are from beneath. I am from above. You are of this world. I am not of this world. ","I said therefore to you that you will die in your sins. For unless you believe that I am he
 you will die in your sins.","Then they said to him
 Who are you? And Jesus said to them
 Even the very same thing that I say to you. ","I have many things to say
 and to judge of you. Yea
 and he who sent me is true. And I speak in the world those things that I have heard from him.","Then Jesus said to them
 When you have lifted up on high the Son of man
 then you will know that I am he
 and that I do nothing of myself
 but as my Father has taught me
 even so I speak. ","And he who sent me is with me. The Father has not left me alone
 for I do always those things that please him.","Then Jesus said to those Jews who believed on him
 If you continue in my words
 then you are my very disciples
 and shall know the truth; ","and the truth shall make you free.","Jesus answered them
 Truly truly I say to you that whoever commits sin
 is the servant of sin. ","And the servant does not abide in the house forever. But the Son abides forever.","If the Son therefore makes you free
 then you are free indeed. ","I know that you are Abraham\u2019s seed. But you seek means to kill me
 because my sayings have no place in you. ","I speak that which I have seen with my Father
 and you do that which you have seen with your father.","They answered and said to him
 Abraham is our father.","But now you are going about to kill me
 a man who has told you the truth
 which I have heard from God. This Abraham did not do. ","You do the deeds of your father.","Jesus said to them
 If God were your Father
 then you would love me. For I proceeded forth and come from God. Neither did I come of myself
 but he sent me. ","Why do you not know my speech? Even because you cannot abide the hearing of my words.","You are of your father
 the devil
 and your will is to follow the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning
 and did not abide in the truth
 because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie
 he speaks of his own nature. For he is a liar
 and the father of lies. ","And because I tell you the truth
 therefore you do not believe me. ","Which of you can rebuke me of sin? If I speak the truth
 why do you not believe me? ","He who is of God
 hears God\u2019s words. You therefore do not hear them
 because you are not of God.","Jesus answered
 I have no devil. But I honour my Father
 and you have dishonoured me. ","I do not seek my own glory
 but there is one who seeks and judges. ","Truly truly I say to you
 if a person keeps my sayings
 he shall never see death.","Then said the Jews to him
 Now we know that you have a devil. Abraham is dead
 and also the prophets
 and yet you say
 If anyone keeps my sayings
 he will never taste of death. ","Jesus answered
 If I honour myself
 my honour is of no value. It is my Father who honours me
 whom you say is your God
 ","and yet you have not known him. But I know him. And if I said I did not know him
 I would be a liar like you. But I know him
 and keep his word. ","Your father Abraham was glad to see my day
 and he saw it and rejoiced.","Jesus said to them
 Truly truly I say to you
 before Abraham was
 I am.","Jesus answered
 Neither has this man sinned
 nor yet his father and mother
 but it is so that the works of God may be shown on him. ","I must work the works of him that sent me while it is day. The night comes
 when no man can work. ","As long as I am in the world
 I am the light of the world.","and said to him
 Go and wash in the pool of Siloam (which
 translated
 means Sent). He went his way and washed
 and came back seeing. ","He answered and said
 The man that is called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes
 and said to me
 Go to the pool Siloam and wash. And I went and washed
 and received my sight.","They said to him
 Where is he? He said
 I do not know.","Then again they called the man who had been blind and said to him
 Give God the praise. We know that this man is a sinner.","He answered and said
 Whether he is a sinner or not
 I do not know. One thing I am sure of: I was blind
 and now I see.","Then they said to him again
 What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?","He answered them
 I told you already
 and you did not hear. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also want to be his disciples?","Jesus heard that they had excommunicated the man
 and as soon as he found him
 he said to him
 Do you believe on the Son of God? ","And Jesus said to him
 You have seen him
 and he it is who talks with you.","Jesus said
 I have come for judgment into this world
 so that those who do not see may see
 and those who see
 may be made blind.","Jesus said to them
 If you were blind
 you would have no sin. But now you say
 We see. Therefore your sin remains.","Truly truly I say to you
 He who does not enter into the sheepfold by the door
 but climbs up some other way
 the same is a thief and a robber. ","He who goes in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep;","to him the porter opens
 and the sheep hear his voice
 and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. ","And when he has sent forth his own sheep
 he goes before them
 and the sheep follow him
 for they know his voice. ","A stranger they will not follow
 but will flee from him. For they know not the voice of strangers.","Then Jesus spoke to them again: Truly truly I say to you
 I am the door of the sheep. ","All
 even as many as came before me
 are thieves and robbers; but the sheep did not hear them. ","I am the door. If anyone enters in by me
 he will be safe
 and will go in and out
 and find pasture. ","The thief comes not but to steal
 kill
 and destroy. I have come so that they may have life
 and have it more abundantly.","I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd gives his life for the sheep.","But a hired servant
 who is not the shepherd
 neither are the sheep his own
 sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep
 and flees; and the wolf catches them
 and scatters the sheep. ","The hired servant flees because he is a hired servant
 and does not care for the sheep.","I am the good shepherd
 and know my own
 and am known by my own. ","As my Father knows me
 even so do I know my Father. And I give my life for the sheep. ","And other sheep I have who are not of this fold. Them also must I bring
 so that they may hear my voice
 and so that there may be one flock and one shepherd.","Therefore does my Father love me: because I put my life from me so that I may take it back again.","No man takes it from me
 but I put it away of myself. I have power to put it from me
 and have power to take it again. This commandment I have received from my Father.","Jesus answered them
 I told you
 and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father\u2019s name
 they bear witness of me. ","But you do not believe
 because you are not of my sheep. ","As I said to you
 my sheep hear my voice
 and I know them
 and they follow me
 ","and I give to them eternal life. And they shall never perish
 neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. ","My Father who gave them to me is greater than all
 and no one is able to take them out of my Father\u2019s hand. ","And I and my Father are one.","Jesus answered them
 Many good works have I shown you from my Father. For which of them would you stone me? ","Jesus answered them
 Is it not written in your law: I say
 you are gods? ","If he called them gods to whom the word of God was spoken (and the scripture cannot be broken)
 ","do you then say to him whom the Father has sanctified and sent into the world
 You blaspheme
 because I said I am the Son of God? ","If I do not do the works of my Father
 believe me not. ","But if I do
 then though you do not believe me
 yet believe the works
 so that you may know and believe that the Father is in me
 and I in him.","When Jesus heard that
 he said
 This infirmity is not unto death
 but for the laud of God
 so that the Son of God may be praised by reason of it.","Then after that he said to his disciples
 Let us go into Judea again. ","Jesus answered
 Are there not twelve hours in the day? If a man walks in the day
 he does not stumble
 because he sees the light of this world. ","But if a man walks in the night
 he stumbles
 because there is no light in him.","This he said
 and after that he said to them
 Our friend Lazarus sleeps
 but I go to wake him out of sleep. ","Then Jesus said to them plainly
 Lazarus is dead. ","And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there
 so that you may believe. But let us go to him.","Then Thomas who is called Didymus said to the disciples
 Let us also go
 so that we may die with him.","Jesus said to her
 Your brother will rise again. ","Jesus said to her
 I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes on me
 yea though he be dead
 yet shall he live. ","And whoever lives and believes on me
 shall never die. Do you believe this?","She said to him
 Yes
 Lord. I believe that you are Christ
 the Son of God who was to come into the world.","Then when Mary arrived where Jesus was and saw him
 she fell down at his feet
 saying to him
 Lord
 if you had been here
 my brother would not be dead.","and said
 Where have you laid him? They said to him
 Lord
 come and see. ","And Jesus said
 Take away the stone.","Jesus said to her
 Did I not say to you that if you believed
 you would see the glory of God?","Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead man was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes and said
 Father
 I thank you
 because you have heard me. ","I know that you hear me always. But because of the people that stand by
 I said this \u2013 so that they may believe that you have sent me.","And when he thus had spoken
 he cried with a loud voice
 Lazarus
 come forth! ","And he that was dead came forth wrapped hand and foot with grave bonds
 and his face was bound about with a headcloth.","Then Jesus said
 Let her alone. She kept it for the day of my burial. ","The poor you will always have with you
 but me you will not always have.","The people that had been with Jesus when he called Lazarus out of his grave and raised him from death were speaking about it.","The Pharisees therefore said among themselves
 See how we are accomplishing nothing? Look
 the world is going away after him.","They came to Philip
 who was of Bethsaida
 a village in Galilee
 and asked him
 saying
 Sir
 we would like to see Jesus. ","And Jesus answered them
 saying
 The hour is come that the Son of man must be glorified. ","Truly truly I say to you
 unless the wheat seed falls into the ground and dies
 it remains alone. If it dies
 it brings forth much fruit. ","He who loves his life will destroy it
 and he who hates his life in this world will keep it unto life eternal. ","If anyone serves me
 let him follow me
 and where I am
 there also shall my servant be. And if anyone serves me
 him will my Father honour.","Now is my soul troubled
 and what shall I say? Father
 deliver me from this hour? But for this cause I have come to this hour. ","Father
 glorify your name.\u00a0 Then there came a voice from heaven:\u00a0 I have glorified it
 and will glorify it again.","Jesus answered and said
 This voice came not because of me
 but for your sakes. ","Now is the judgment of this world; now shall the prince of this world be cast out.","And I
 if I be lifted up from the earth
 will draw all peoples unto me.","Then Jesus said to them
 Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while you have light
 lest the darkness come on you. He who walks in the dark does not know where he is going. ","While you have light
 believe on the light
 so that you may be the children of the light.","And Jesus cried out and said
 He who believes on me
 believes not on me
 but on him who sent me. ","And he who sees me
 sees him who sent me.\u00a0 ","I am come a light into the world
 so that whosoever believes on me will not remain in darkness. ","And if a person hears my words and does not believe
 I do not judge him. For I came not to judge the world
 but to save the world. ","He who refuses me
 and does not receive my words
 has one that judges him. The words that I have spoken
 they will judge him in the last day. ","For I have not spoken of myself
 but the Father who sent me
 he gave me a commandment
 what I should say and what I should speak. ","And I know that this commandment is life everlasting. Whatsoever I speak therefore
 even as the Father has said to me
 so I speak.","Jesus answered and said to him
 What I am doing
 you do not understand now
 but you will know hereafter. ","Peter said to him
 You shall not wash my feet while the world stands! Jesus answered him
 If I do not wash you
 you will have no part with me. ","Jesus said to him
 He who is washed needs not but to wash his feet
 and is clean every whit. And you my disciples are clean \u2013 but not all. ","For he knew his betrayer. Therefore he said
 you are not all clean.","After he had washed their feet and received his clothes and was seated again
 he said to them
 Do you understand what I have done to you? ","You call me Teacher and Lord
 and you say well
 for so I am. ","If I then
 your Lord and Teacher
 have washed your feet
 you also ought to wash one another\u2019s feet. ","For I have given you an example
 so that you will do as I have done to you. ","Truly truly I say to you
 the servant is not greater than his master
 nor the messenger greater than he who sent him. ","If you understand these things
 happy are you if you do them.","I am not speaking of you all. I know whom I have chosen. But so that the scripture may be fulfilled
 he who eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me. ","Now I tell you before it happens
 so that when it has come to pass
 you may believe that I am he. ","Truly truly I say to you
 he who receives whomever I send
 receives me. And he who receives me
 receives him who sent me.","When Jesus had said these things
 he was troubled in the spirit and testified
 saying
 Truly truly I say to you
 that one of you will betray me.","Jesus answered
 It is he to whom I give a sop when I have dipped it. And he wet a sop and gave it to Judas Iscariot
 Simon\u2019s son. ","And after the sop
 Satan entered into him.","When he had gone out
 Jesus said
 Now is the Son of man glorified
 and God is glorified by him. ","If God is glorified by him
 God will also glorify him in himself
 and will straightaway glorify him.","Dear children
 yet a little while I am with you. You will seek me
 and as I said to the Jews
 where I am going
 you cannot come. ","Also I say to you now
 a new commandment I give to you: to love together. As I have loved you
 so also should you love one another. ","By this shall all men know that you are my disciples
 if you have love for one another.","Simon Peter said to him
 Lord
 where are you going? Jesus answered him
 Where I am going you cannot follow me now
 but you will follow me afterwards. ","Jesus answered him
 Will you give your life for my sake? Truly truly I say to you
 the cock will not crow till you have denied me three times.","And he said to his disciples
 Let not your hearts be troubled. Believe in God
 and believe in me. ","In my Father\u2019s house are many rooms. If it were not so
 I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. ","And if I go to prepare a place for you
 I will come again and receive you unto myself
 so that where I am
 there you may be also. ","And where I go
 you know; and the way
 you know.","Jesus said to him
 I am the way
 the truth
 and the life. And no one comes to the Father except by me. ","If you have known me
 you have known my Father also. And now you know him
 and have seen him.","Jesus said to him
 Have I been so long a time with you
 and yet you have not known me? Philip
 he who has seen me has seen the Father. And how do you say then
 Show us the Father? ","Do you not believe that I am in the Father
 and the Father in me? The words that I speak to you
 I do not speak of myself
 but the Father who dwells in me is he who does the works. ","Believe me
 that I am in the Father
 and the Father in me. At the least
 believe me for the very works\u2019 sake.","Truly truly I say to you
 He who believes on me
 the works that I do
 he also will do; and greater works than these he will do
 because I go to my Father. ","And whatever you ask in my name
 that I will do
 so that the Father may be glorified by the Son. ","If you ask anything in my name
 I will do it.","If you love me
 keep my commandments. ","And I will pray the Father
 and he will give you another Comforter
 so that he may be with you forever
 ","which is the Spirit of Truth \u2013 whom the world cannot receive
 because the world neither sees him nor knows him. But you know him. For he dwells with you and shall be in you. ","I will not leave you comfortless
 but will come to you.","Yet a little while
 and the world will see me no more. But you will see me. For I live
 and you will live. ","That day you will know that I am in my Father
 and you in me
 and I in you.","He who has my commandments and keeps them
 that is he who loves me. And he who loves me shall be loved by my Father
 and I will love him and will show my own self to him.","Judas said to him (not Judas Iscariot)
 Lord
 what is the reason that you will show yourself to us
 and not to the world?","Jesus answered and said to him
 If a person loves me and will keep my sayings
 my Father also will love him
 and we will come to him and will dwell with him. ","He who does not love me
 does not keep my sayings. And the words that you hear are not mine
 but the Father\u2019s who sent me.","This I have spoken to you being yet present with you.","But the Comforter
 which is the Holy Spirit (whom my Father will send in my name)
 he will teach you all things
 and bring all things to your remembrance
 whatsoever I have told you.","Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled
 and do not fear. ","You have heard how I said to you
 I am going away
 and coming again to you. If you loved me
 you would indeed rejoice because I said I am going to the Father. For the Father is greater than I. ","And now I have told you before it comes
 so that when it has come to pass
 you may believe.","Hereafter I will not speak many words to you. For the ruler of this world comes. And he has nothing in me
 ","but so that the world may know that I love the Father
 therefore as the Father gave me commandment
 even so I do.\u00a0 Arise
 let us go from here.","I am the true vine
 and my Father is the husbandman. ","Every branch that does not bear fruit in me
 he will take away. And every branch that bears fruit he will prune
 so that it may bring forth more fruit. ","Now you are clean through the words that I have spoken to you.","Abide in me
 and let me abide in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself
 unless it abides in the vine
 no more can you unless you abide in me.","I am the vine and you are the branches. He who abides in me
 and I in him
 the same brings forth much fruit. For without me you can do nothing. ","If a person does not abide in me
 he is cast forth like a branch
 and is withered; and men gather it and cast it into the fire
 and it burns. ","If you abide in me
 and my words also abide in you
 ask what you will
 and it shall be done for you. ","In this is my Father glorified: that you bear much fruit and be made my disciples.","As the Father has loved me
 even so have I loved you. Continue in my love. ","If you keep my commandments
 you will abide in my love
 even as I have kept my Father\u2019s commandments and abide in his love.","These things I have spoken to you so that my joy may remain in you
 and so that your joy may be full.","This is my commandment: that you love together
 as I have loved you. ","Greater love than this has no man
 than to bestow his life for his friends. ","You are my friends
 if you do whatsoever I command you. ","Henceforth I do not call you servants
 for the servant knows not what his lord does
 but I have called you friends. For all that I have heard from my Father
 I have made known to you.","You have not chosen me
 but I have chosen you
 and ordained you
 that you should go and bring forth fruit
 and that your fruit should endure; that whatever you ask of the Father in my name
 he should give it to you.","This I command you: love one another.","If the world hates you
 you know that it hated me before it hated you. ","If you were of the world
 the world would love its own. However because you are not of the world
 but I have chosen you out of the world
 therefore the world hates you. ","Remember the saying that I said to you: the servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me
 so will they persecute you. If they have kept my sayings
 so will they keep yours. ","But they will do all these things to you for my name\u2019s sake
 because they have not known him who sent me. ","If I had not come and spoken to them
 they would not have had sin. But now they have nothing to cloak their sin with.","He who hates me
 hates my Father. ","If I had not done works among them which no other man did
 they would not have sin. But now they have seen
 and yet have hated both me and my Father
 ","even so that the saying is fulfilled that is written in their law: They hated me without a cause.","But when the Comforter is come
 whom I will send to you from the Father
 which is the Spirit of truth who proceeds of the Father
 he will testify of me. ","And you shall bear witness also
 because you have been with me from the beginning.","These things I have said to you so that you are not made to stumble.","They will excommunicate you; yea
 the time shall come that whoever kills you will think that he does God service. ","And such things they will do to you because they have not known the Father nor me.","But I have told you these things so that when that hour comes
 you may remember them
 that I told you so.\u00a0","But now I go my way to him who sent me
 and none of you asks me
 Where are you going? ","But because I have said such things to you
 your hearts are full of sorrow. ","Nevertheless
 I tell you the truth: it is better for you that I go away. For if I do not go away
 the Comforter will not come to you. But if I depart
 I will send him to you. ","And when he is come
 he will rebuke the world of sin
 and of righteousness
 and of judgment: ","of sin
 because they do not believe on me; ","of righteousness
 because I go to my Father and you will see me no more; ","and of judgment
 because the chief ruler of this world is judged already.","I have yet many things to say to you
 but you cannot receive them now. ","However
 when he is come (I mean the Spirit of truth)
 he will lead you into all truth. He will not speak of himself
 but whatever he hears
 that he will speak
 and he will show you things to come. ","He will glorify me
 for he will receive of mine and will show it to you. ","All things that the Father has are mine. Therefore I said to you that he will take of mine and show it to you.","After a while you will not see me
 and again after a while you will see me
 because I go to the Father.","Then some of his disciples said between themselves
 What is this that he says to us
 After a while you will not see me
 and again after a while you will see me? and
 Because I go to the Father? ","They said therefore
 What is this that he says
 After a while? We cannot understand what he says.","Jesus perceived that they wanted to question him and said to them
 You enquire about this between yourselves
 that I said
 After a while you will not see me
 and again after a while you will see me. ","Truly truly I say to you
 you will weep and lament
 and the world will rejoice. You will sorrow; but your sorrow will be turned to joy.","A woman when she travails has sorrow
 because her hour is come. But as soon as she is delivered of the child
 she remembers no more the anguish
 for joy that a man is born into the world. ","And you now are in sorrow. But I will see you again
 and your hearts will rejoice
 and no one will take your joy from you. ","And in that day you will ask me no question. Truly truly I say to you
 whatever you ask the Father in my name
 he will give you. ","Until now you have asked nothing in my name. Ask
 and you will receive
 so that your joy may be full.","These things I have spoken to you in parables. The time will come when I will speak no more to you in figures
 but I will show you plainly from my Father. ","At that day
 you will ask in my name. And I say not to you that I will speak to my Father for you. ","For the Father himself loves you
 because you have loved me and have believed that I came out from God. ","I went out from the Father and came into the world
 and I leave the world again and go to the Father.","Jesus answered them
 Now you do believe. ","Behold
 the hour draws near
 and is already come
 that you shall be scattered every man his ways
 and will leave me alone. And yet I am not alone
 because the Father is with me.","These words I have spoken to you so that in me you may have peace. For in the world you will have tribulation. But be of good cheer: I have overcome the world.","These words Jesus spoke
 and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said
 Father
 the hour is come. Glorify your Son so that your Son may glorify you. ","For you have given him power over all flesh
 so that he may give eternal life to as many as you have given him. ","This is life eternal: to know you
 the only true God
 and Jesus Christ whom you have sent.","I have glorified you on the earth. I have finished the work that you gave me to do.","And now glorify me
 Father
 with your own self \u2013 with the glory that I had with you before the world was. ","I have declared your name to the men that you gave me out of the world. Yours they were
 and you gave them to me
 and they have kept your sayings. ","Now they know that all things
 whatsoever you have given me
 are of you. ","For I have given to them the words that you gave me
 and they have received them
 and know surely that I came out from you
 and do believe that you did send me.","I pray for them \u2013 and pray not for the world
 but for those whom you have given me. For they are yours. ","And all mine are yours
 and yours are mine
 and I am glorified in them. ","And now I am no longer in the world
 but they are in the world
 and I come to you. Holy Father
 keep in your own name those whom you have given me so that they may be one
 as we are. ","While I was with them in the world
 I kept them in your name. Those whom you gave me I have kept
 and none of them is lost except that lost child
 so that the scripture may be fulfilled.","Now I come to you. And I speak these words in the world so that they may have my joy full in them.","I have given them your words. And the world has hated them
 because they are not of the world
 just as I am not of the world. ","I ask not that you take them out of the world
 but that you keep them from evil. ","They are not of the world
 as I am not of the world. ","Sanctify them with your truth. Your word is truth.","As you sent me into the world
 so have I sent them into the world. ","And for their sakes I sanctify myself
 so that they also may be sanctified through the truth.","I pray not for them alone
 but also for those who will believe on me through their preaching: ","that they all may be one
 as you
 Father
 are in me
 and I in you; that they may also be one in us
 so that the world may believe that you have sent me. ","And the glory that you gave me
 I have given them
 so that they may be one as we are one
 ","I in them and you in me
 so that they may be made perfect in one
 and so that the world may know that you have sent me
 and have loved them as you have loved me.","Father
 I will that those whom you have given me be with me where I am
 that they may see the glory that you have given me. For you loved me before the making of the world. ","O righteous Father
 the very world has not known you
 but I have known you
 and these have known that you have sent me. ","And I have declared to them your name
 and will declare it
 so that the love with which you have loved me may be in them
 and so that I may be in them.","Then Jesus
 knowing all things that would come on him
 went forth and said to them
 Whom do you seek? ","They answered him
 Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus said to them
 I am he.","But as soon as Jesus had said to them
 I am he
 they went backwards and fell to the ground. ","And he asked them again
 Whom do you seek? They said
 Jesus of Nazareth. ","Jesus answered
 I said to you
 I am he. If you seek me
 let these go their way. ","Then Jesus said to Peter
 Put up your sword into the sheath. Shall I not drink of the cup which my Father has given me?","Then the maid that kept the door said to Peter
 Are you not one of this man\u2019s disciples? He said
 I am not. ","Jesus answered him
 I spoke openly in the world. I always taught in the synagogue and in the temple where all the Jews come together
 and in secret I have said nothing. ","Why do you ask me? Ask those who heard me what I said to them. They can tell what I said.","Jesus answered him
 If I have spoken wrongly
 bear witness of the wrong. If I have spoken well
 why do you hit me?","Then Pilate said to them
 You take him and judge him according to your own law.","Jesus answered
 Do you say that of yourself
 or did others tell you this about me?","Jesus answered
 My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world
 then my servants would surely fight so that I would not be delivered to the Jews. But now my kingdom is not from here.","Pilate said to him
 Are you a king then?","Pilate went forth again and said to the people
 Look
 I am bringing him out to you so that you may know that I find no fault in him. ","Then Jesus came forth wearing the crown of thorns and the robe of purple. And Pilate said to them
 Behold the man!","When the high priests and officers saw him
 they cried out
 saying
 Crucify him
 crucify him! Pilate said to them
 You take him and crucify him
 for I find no fault in him. ","Jesus answered
 You could have no power at all against me unless it were given you from above. Therefore he who delivered me to you is more in sin.","It was the day before the Sabbath that falls in the Passover feast
 and about the sixth hour. And he said to the Jews
 Behold your king! ","When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing by
 he said to his mother
 Woman
 behold your son. ","Then he said to the disciple
 Behold your mother. And from that hour
 the disciple took her for his own.","After that
 when Jesus perceived that all things were performed
 so that the scripture would be fulfilled
 he said
 I thirst! ","As soon as Jesus had received of the vinegar
 he said
 It is finished! And he bowed his head and gave up the spirit.","Then she ran and went to Simon Peter
 and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved
 and said to them
 They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb
 and we do not know where they have laid him.","And they said to her
 Woman
 why do you weep? She said to them
 Because they have taken away my Lord and I do not know where they have laid him.","Jesus said to her
 Woman
 why do you weep? Whom are you seeking?","Jesus said to her
 Mary! She turned herself about and said to him
 Rabboni! (which is to say
 Teacher!).","Jesus said to her
 Do not touch me
 for I am not yet ascended to my Father. But go to my brethren and say to them
 I am ascending to my Father and your Father
 to my God and your God.","The same day at night
 which was the day after the Sabbath day
 when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled together for fear of the Jews
 Jesus came and stood in their midst and said to them
 Peace be with you. ","Then Jesus said to them again
 Peace be with you. As my Father sent me
 so I also send you.","And when he had said that
 he breathed on them and said to them
 Receive the Holy Spirit. ","Whosever sins you remit
 they are remitted to them
 and whosever sins you retain
 they are retained.","The other disciples said to him
 We have seen the Lord! And he said to them
 Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails
 and put my finger in the marks of the nails
 and put my hand into his side
 I will not believe.","And after eight days his disciples were again inside
 and Thomas with them. Then Jesus came when the doors were shut and stood in their midst and said
 Peace be with you.","After that he said to Thomas
 Bring your finger here
 and see my hands
 and bring your hand and put it into my side; and be not faithless
 but believing.","Jesus said to him
 Thomas
 because you have seen me
 therefore you believe. Happy are those who have not seen and yet believe!","Jesus said to them
 Sirs
 do you have any fish? They answered him
 No. ","Jesus said to them
 Bring some of the fish that you have now caught. ","Jesus said to them
 Come and eat. And none of the disciples ventured to ask him
 Who are you? because they knew that it was the Lord. ","When they had eaten
 Jesus said to Simon Peter
 Simon son of Jonah
 do you love me more than these?","He said to him again the second time
 Simon son of Jonah
 do you love me?","He said to him the third time
 Simon
 do you love me?","Truly truly I say to you
 when you were young
 you girded yourself and walked where you wished. But when you are old
 you will stretch forth your hands
 and another will gird you and lead you where you do not wish.","He spoke this signifying by what death Peter would glorify God. And when he had said this
 he said to him
 Follow me.","Jesus said to him
 If I desire him to remain till I come
 what is that to you? Follow me.","Then there went out a saying among the brethren that that disciple would not die. But Jesus did not say to him that he would not die
 but
 If I desire him to remain till I come
 what is that to you?","They asked him
 \u201cWell
 are you Elijah?\u201d John answered
 \u201cNo
 I\u2019m not.\u201d Then they asked
 \u201cAre you the prophet?\u201d John replied
 \u201cNo.\u201d","So they asked him
 \u201cWho are you? Tell us so that we can take an answer back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?\u201d","John said
 \u201cI\u2019m a voice crying out in the desert
 \u2018Make the way for the Lord straight
\u2019 as the prophet Isaiah said.\u201d","Yeshua turned around and saw them following him. He asked them
 \u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d They said to him
 \u201cRabbi\u201d (which means \u201cteacher\u201d)
 \u201cwhere are you staying?\u201d","Yeshua told them
 \u201cCome
 and you will see.\u201d So they went to see where he was staying and spent the rest of that day with him. It was about ten o\u2019clock in the morning.","Andrew brought Simon to Yeshua. Yeshua looked at Simon and said
 \u201cYou are Simon
 son of John. Your name will be Cephas\u201d (which means \u201cPeter\u201d).","The next day Yeshua wanted to go to Galilee. He found Philip and told him
 \u201cFollow me!\u201d ","Philip found Nathanael and told him
 \u201cWe have found the man whom Moses wrote about in his teachings and whom the prophets wrote about. He is Yeshua
 son of Joseph
 from the city of Nazareth.\u201d","Nathanael said to Philip
 \u201cCan anything good come from Nazareth?\u201d Philip told him
 \u201cCome and see!\u201d","Yeshua saw Nathanael coming toward him and remarked
 \u201cHere is a true Israelite who is sincere.\u201d","Nathanael asked Yeshua
 \u201cHow do you know anything about me?\u201d Yeshua answered him
 \u201cI saw you under the fig tree before Philip called you.\u201d","Yeshua replied
 \u201cYou believe because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree. You will see greater things than that.\u201d ","Yeshua said to Nathanael
 \u201cI can guarantee this truth: You will see the sky open and God\u2019s angels going up and coming down to the Son of Man.\u201d","Yeshua said to her
 \u201cWhy did you come to me? My time has not yet come.\u201d","Yeshua told the servers
 \u201cFill the jars with water.\u201d The servers filled the jars to the brim. ","Yeshua said to them
 \u201cPour some
 and take it to the person in charge.\u201d The servers did as they were told.","He told those who sold pigeons
 \u201cPick up this stuff
 and get it out of here! Stop making my Father\u2019s house a marketplace!\u201d","Yeshua replied
 \u201cTear down this temple
 and I\u2019ll rebuild it in three days.\u201d","Yeshua replied to Nicodemus
 \u201cI can guarantee this truth: No one can see the kingdom of God without being born from above.\u201d","Yeshua answered Nicodemus
 \u201cI can guarantee this truth: No one can enter the kingdom of God without being born of water and the Spirit. ","Flesh and blood give birth to flesh and blood
 but the Spirit gives birth to things that are spiritual. ","Don\u2019t be surprised when I tell you that all of you must be born from above.","The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound
 but you don\u2019t know where the wind comes from or where it\u2019s going. That\u2019s the way it is with everyone born of the Spirit.\u201d","Yeshua told Nicodemus
 \u201cYou\u2019re a well-known teacher of Israel. Can\u2019t you understand this? ","I can guarantee this truth: We know what we\u2019re talking about
 and we confirm what we\u2019ve seen. Yet
 you don\u2019t accept our message. ","If you don\u2019t believe me when I tell you about things on earth
 how will you believe me when I tell you about things in heaven? ","No one has gone to heaven except the Son of Man
 who came from heaven.","\u201cAs Moses lifted up the snake on a pole in the desert
 so the Son of Man must be lifted up. ","Then everyone who believes in him will have eternal life.\u201d","God loved the world this way: He gave his only Son so that everyone who believes in him will not die but will have eternal life.","God sent his Son into the world
 not to condemn the world
 but to save the world. ","Those who believe in him won\u2019t be condemned. But those who don\u2019t believe are already condemned because they don\u2019t believe in God\u2019s only Son.","This is why people are condemned: The light came into the world. Yet
 people loved the dark rather than the light because their actions were evil. ","People who do what is wrong hate the light and don\u2019t come to the light. They don\u2019t want their actions to be exposed.","But people who do what is true come to the light so that the things they do for God may be clearly seen.","So they went to John and asked him

 \u201cEveryone who drinks this water will become thirsty again. ","But those who drink the water that I will give them will never become thirsty again. In fact
 the water I will give them will become in them a spring that gushes up to eternal life.\u201d","The woman told Yeshua

 \u201cI don\u2019t have a husband.\u201d Yeshua told her

 \u201cGo home. Your son will live.\u201d The man believed what Yeshua told him and left.","The official asked them at what time his son got better. His servants told him
 \u201cThe fever left him yesterday evening at seven o\u2019clock.\u201d ","Then the boy\u2019s father realized that it was the same time that Yeshua had told him
 \u201cYour son will live.\u201d So the official and his entire family became believers.","Yeshua saw the man lying there and knew that he had been sick for a long time. So Yeshua asked the man
 \u201cWould you like to get well?\u201d","Yeshua told the man
 \u201cGet up
 pick up your cot
 and walk.\u201d ","The man replied
 \u201cThe man who made me well told me to pick up my cot and walk.\u201d","Later
 Yeshua met the man in the temple courtyard and told him
 \u201cYou\u2019re well now. Stop sinning so that something worse doesn\u2019t happen to you.\u201d","Yeshua replied to them
 \u201cMy Father is working right now
 and so am I.\u201d","Yeshua said to the Jews
 \u201cI can guarantee this truth: The Son cannot do anything on his own. He can do only what he sees the Father doing. Indeed
 the Son does exactly what the Father does. ","The Father loves the Son and shows him everything he is doing. The Father will show him even greater things to do than these things so that you will be amazed.","In the same way that the Father brings back the dead and gives them life
 the Son gives life to anyone he chooses.","\u201cThe Father doesn\u2019t judge anyone. He has entrusted judgment entirely to the Son","so that everyone will honor the Son as they honor the Father. Whoever doesn\u2019t honor the Son doesn\u2019t honor the Father who sent him.","I can guarantee this truth: Those who listen to what I say and believe in the one who sent me will have eternal life. They won\u2019t be judged because they have already passed from death to life.","\u201cI can guarantee this truth: A time is coming (and is now here) when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who respond to it will live.","The Father is the source of life
 and he has enabled the Son to be the source of life too.","\u201cHe has also given the Son authority to pass judgment because he is the Son of Man.","Don\u2019t be surprised at what I\u2019ve just said. A time is coming when all the dead will hear his voice
 ","and they will come out of their tombs. Those who have done good will come back to life and live. But those who have done evil will come back to life and will be judged.","I can\u2019t do anything on my own. As I listen to the Father
 I make my judgments. My judgments are right because I don\u2019t try to do what I want but what the one who sent me wants.","\u201cIf I testify on my own behalf
 what I say isn\u2019t true. ","Someone else testifies on my behalf
 and I know that what he says about me is true. ","You sent people to John the Baptizer
 and he testified to the truth. ","But I don\u2019t depend on human testimony. I\u2019m telling you this to save you.","John was a lamp that gave off brilliant light. For a time you enjoyed the pleasure of his light.","But I have something that testifies more favorably on my behalf than John\u2019s testimony. The tasks that the Father gave me to carry out
 these tasks which I perform
 testify on my behalf. They prove that the Father has sent me. ","The Father who sent me testifies on my behalf. You have never heard his voice
 and you have never seen his form. ","So you don\u2019t have the Father\u2019s message within you
 because you don\u2019t believe in the person he has sent. ","You study the Scriptures in detail because you think you have the source of eternal life in them. These Scriptures testify on my behalf.","Yet
 you don\u2019t want to come to me to get eternal life.","\u201cI don\u2019t accept praise from humans.","But I know what kind of people you are. You don\u2019t have any love for God.","I have come with the authority my Father has given me
 but you don\u2019t accept me. If someone else comes with his own authority
 you will accept him. ","How can you believe when you accept each other\u2019s praise and don\u2019t look for the praise that comes from the only God?","\u201cDon\u2019t think that I will accuse you in the presence of the Father. Moses
 the one you trust
 is already accusing you. ","If you really believed Moses
 you would believe me. Moses wrote about me. ","If you don\u2019t believe what Moses wrote
 how will you ever believe what I say?\u201d","As Yeshua saw a large crowd coming to him
 he said to Philip
 \u201cWhere can we buy bread for these people to eat?\u201d ","Yeshua said
 \u201cHave the people sit down.\u201d The people had plenty of grass to sit on. (There were about 5
000 men in the crowd.)","When the people were full
 Yeshua told his disciples
 \u201cGather the leftover pieces so that nothing will be wasted.\u201d ","Yeshua told them
 \u201cIt\u2019s me. Don\u2019t be afraid!\u201d","Yeshua replied to them
 \u201cI can guarantee this truth: You\u2019re not looking for me because you saw miracles. You are looking for me because you ate as much of those loaves as you wanted. ","Don\u2019t work for food that spoils. Instead
 work for the food that lasts into eternal life. This is the food the Son of Man will give you. After all
 the Father has placed his seal of approval on him.\u201d","Yeshua replied to them
 \u201cGod wants to do something for you so that you believe in the one whom he has sent.\u201d","Yeshua said to them
 \u201cI can guarantee this truth: Moses didn\u2019t give you bread from heaven
 but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven. ","God\u2019s bread is the man who comes from heaven and gives life to the world.\u201d","Yeshua told them
 \u201cI am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never become hungry
 and whoever believes in me will never become thirsty. ","I\u2019ve told you that you have seen me. However
 you don\u2019t believe in me. ","Everyone whom the Father gives me will come to me. I will never turn away anyone who comes to me.","I haven\u2019t come from heaven to do what I want to do. I\u2019ve come to do what the one who sent me wants me to do.","The one who sent me doesn\u2019t want me to lose any of those he gave me. He wants me to bring them back to life on the last day.","My Father wants all those who see the Son and believe in him to have eternal life. He wants me to bring them back to life on the last day.\u201d","Yeshua responded
 \u201cStop criticizing me! ","People cannot come to me unless the Father who sent me brings them to me. I will bring these people back to life on the last day.","The prophets wrote
 \u2018God will teach everyone.\u2019 Those who do what they have learned from the Father come to me. ","I\u2019m saying that no one has seen the Father. Only the one who is from God has seen the Father.","I can guarantee this truth: Every believer has eternal life.","\u201cI am the bread of life.","Your ancestors ate the manna in the desert and died.","This is the bread that comes from heaven so that whoever eats it won\u2019t die.","I am the living bread that came from heaven. Whoever eats this bread will live forever. The bread I will give to bring life to the world is my flesh.\u201d","Yeshua told them
 \u201cI can guarantee this truth: If you don\u2019t eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood
 you don\u2019t have the source of life in you. ","Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood have eternal life
 and I will bring them back to life on the last day. ","My flesh is true food
 and my blood is true drink. ","Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood live in me
 and I live in them. ","The Father who has life sent me
 and I live because of the Father. So those who feed on me will live because of me. ","This is the bread that came from heaven. It is not like the bread your ancestors ate. They eventually died. Those who eat this bread will live forever.\u201d","Yeshua was aware that his disciples were criticizing his message. So Yeshua asked them
 \u201cDid what I say make you lose faith? ","What if you see the Son of Man go where he was before?","Life is spiritual. Your physical existence doesn\u2019t contribute to that life. The words that I have spoken to you are spiritual. They are life.","But some of you don\u2019t believe.\u201d Yeshua knew from the beginning those who wouldn\u2019t believe and the one who would betray him.","So he added
 \u201cThat is why I told you that people cannot come to me unless the Father provides the way.\u201d","So Yeshua asked the twelve apostles
 \u201cDo you want to leave me too?\u201d","Yeshua replied
 \u201cI chose all twelve of you. Yet
 one of you is a devil.\u201d ","So Yeshua\u2019s brothers told him
 \u201cLeave this place
 and go to Judea so that your disciples can see the things that you\u2019re doing. ","Yeshua told them
 \u201cNow is not the right time for me to go. Any time is right for you. ","The world cannot hate you
 but it hates me because I say that what everyone does is evil. ","Go to the festival. I\u2019m not going to this festival right now. Now is not the right time for me to go.\u201d","Yeshua responded to them
 \u201cWhat I teach doesn\u2019t come from me but from the one who sent me. ","Those who want to follow the will of God will know if what I teach is from God or if I teach my own thoughts.","Those who speak their own thoughts are looking for their own glory. But the man who wants to bring glory to the one who sent him is a true teacher and doesn\u2019t have dishonest motives.","Didn\u2019t Moses give you his teachings? Yet
 none of you does what Moses taught you. So why do you want to kill me?\u201d","Yeshua answered them
 \u201cI performed one miracle
 and all of you are surprised by it. ","Moses gave you the teaching about circumcision (although it didn\u2019t come from Moses but from our ancestors). So you circumcise a male on a day of worship.","If you circumcise a male on the day of worship to follow Moses\u2019 Teachings
 why are you angry with me because I made a man entirely well on the day of worship? ","Stop judging by outward appearance! Instead
 judge correctly.\u201d","Some of the people who lived in Jerusalem said
 \u201cIsn\u2019t this the man they want to kill? ","Then
 while Yeshua was teaching in the temple courtyard
 he said loudly
 \u201cYou know me
 and you know where I come from. I didn\u2019t decide to come on my own. The one who sent me is true. He\u2019s the one you don\u2019t know. ","I know him because I am from him and he sent me.\u201d","Yeshua said
 \u201cI will still be with you for a little while. Then I\u2019ll go to the one who sent me. ","You will look for me
 but you won\u2019t find me. You can\u2019t go where I\u2019m going.\u201d","The Jews said among themselves
 \u201cWhere does this man intend to go so that we won\u2019t find him? Does he mean that he\u2019ll live with the Jews who are scattered among the Greeks and that he\u2019ll teach the Greeks? ","On the last and most important day of the festival
 Yeshua was standing in the temple courtyard. He said loudly
 \u201cWhoever is thirsty must come to me to drink. ","As Scripture says
 \u2018Streams of living water will flow from deep within the person who believes in me.\u2019\u201d ","Yeshua said this about the Spirit
 whom his believers would receive. The Spirit was not yet evident
 as it would be after Yeshua had been glorified.","and asked Yeshua
 \u201cTeacher
 we caught this woman in the act of adultery. ","When they persisted in asking him questions
 he straightened up and said
 \u201cThe person who is sinless should be the first to throw a stone at her.\u201d ","Then Yeshua straightened up and asked her
 \u201cWhere did they go? Has anyone condemned you?\u201d","The woman answered
 \u201cNo one
 sir.\u201d Yeshua said
 \u201cI don\u2019t condemn you either. Go! From now on don\u2019t sin.\u201d","Yeshua spoke to the Pharisees again. He said
 \u201cI am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will have a life filled with light and will never live in the dark.\u201d","Yeshua replied to them
 \u201cEven if I testify on my own behalf
 my testimony is true because I know where I came from and where I\u2019m going. However
 you don\u2019t know where I came from or where I\u2019m going. ","You judge the way humans do. I don\u2019t judge anyone.","Even if I do judge
 my judgment is valid because I don\u2019t make it on my own. I make my judgment with the Father who sent me. ","Your own teachings say that the testimony of two people is true.","I testify on my own behalf
 and so does the Father who sent me.\u201d","The Pharisees asked him
 \u201cWhere is your father?\u201d Yeshua replied
 \u201cYou don\u2019t know me or my Father. If you knew me
 you would also know my Father.\u201d","Yeshua spoke to the Pharisees again. He said
 \u201cI\u2019m going away
 and you\u2019ll look for me. But you will die because of your sin. You can\u2019t go where I\u2019m going.\u201d","Yeshua said to them
 \u201cYou\u2019re from below. I\u2019m from above. You\u2019re from this world. I\u2019m not from this world. ","For this reason I told you that you\u2019ll die because of your sins. If you don\u2019t believe that I am the one
 you\u2019ll die because of your sins.\u201d","The Jews asked him
 \u201cWho did you say you are?\u201d Yeshua told them
 \u201cI am who I said I was from the beginning. ","I have a lot I could say about you and a lot I could condemn you for. But the one who sent me is true. So I tell the world exactly what he has told me.\u201d","So Yeshua told them
 \u201cWhen you have lifted up the Son of Man
 then you\u2019ll know that I am the one and that I can\u2019t do anything on my own. Instead
 I speak as the Father taught me. ","Besides
 the one who sent me is with me. He hasn\u2019t left me by myself. I always do what pleases him.\u201d","So Yeshua said to those Jews who believed in him
 \u201cIf you live by what I say
 you are truly my disciples. ","You will know the truth
 and the truth will set you free.\u201d","Yeshua answered them
 \u201cI can guarantee this truth: Whoever lives a sinful life is a slave to sin. ","A slave doesn\u2019t live in the home forever
 but a son does. ","So if the Son sets you free
 you will be absolutely free. ","I know that you\u2019re Abraham\u2019s descendants. However
 you want to kill me because you don\u2019t like what I\u2019m saying. ","What I\u2019m saying is what I have seen in my Father\u2019s presence. But you do what you\u2019ve heard from your father.\u201d","The Jews replied to Yeshua
 \u201cAbraham is our father.\u201d Yeshua told them
 \u201cIf you were Abraham\u2019s children
 you would do what Abraham did. ","I am a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. But now you want to kill me. Abraham wouldn\u2019t have done that.","You\u2019re doing what your father does.\u201d The Jews said to Yeshua
 \u201cWe\u2019re not illegitimate children. God is our only Father.\u201d","Yeshua told them
 \u201cIf God were your Father
 you would love me. After all
 I\u2019m here
 and I came from God. I didn\u2019t come on my own. Instead
 God sent me. ","Why don\u2019t you understand the language I use? Is it because you can\u2019t understand the words I use?","You come from your father
 the devil
 and you desire to do what your father wants you to do. The devil was a murderer from the beginning. He has never been truthful. He doesn\u2019t know what the truth is. Whenever he tells a lie
 he\u2019s doing what comes naturally to him. He\u2019s a liar and the father of lies. ","So you don\u2019t believe me because I tell the truth.","Can any of you convict me of committing a sin? If I\u2019m telling the truth
 why don\u2019t you believe me? ","The person who belongs to God understands what God says. You don\u2019t understand because you don\u2019t belong to God.\u201d","Yeshua answered
 \u201cI\u2019m not possessed. I honor my Father
 but you dishonor me. ","I don\u2019t want my own glory. But there is someone who wants it
 and he is the judge. ","I can guarantee this truth: Whoever obeys what I say will never see death.\u201d","The Jews told Yeshua
 \u201cNow we know that you\u2019re possessed by a demon. Abraham died
 and so did the prophets
 but you say
 \u2018Whoever does what I say will never taste death.\u2019 ","Yeshua said
 \u201cIf I bring glory to myself
 my glory is nothing. My Father is the one who gives me glory
 and you say that he is your God. ","Yet
 you haven\u2019t known him. However
 I know him. If I would say that I didn\u2019t know him
 I would be a liar like all of you. But I do know him
 and I do what he says. ","Your father Abraham was pleased to see that my day was coming. He saw it and was happy.\u201d","Yeshua told them
 \u201cI can guarantee this truth: Before Abraham was ever born
 I am.\u201d","Yeshua answered
 \u201cNeither this man nor his parents sinned. Instead
 he was born blind so that God could show what he can do for him. ","We must do what the one who sent me wants us to do while it is day. The night when no one can do anything is coming.","As long as I\u2019m in the world
 I\u2019m light for the world.\u201d","and told him
 \u201cWash it off in the pool of Siloam.\u201d (Siloam means \u201csent.\u201d) The blind man washed it off and returned. He was able to see.","He replied
 \u201cThe man people call Yeshua mixed some spit with dirt
 smeared it on my eyes
 and told me
 \u2018Go to Siloam
 and wash it off.\u2019 So I went there
 washed it off
 and received my sight.\u201d","They asked him
 \u201cWhere is that man?\u201d The man answered
 \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d","So once again the Jews called the man who had been blind. They told him
 \u201cGive glory to God. We know that this man who gave you sight is a sinner.\u201d","The man responded
 \u201cI don\u2019t know if he\u2019s a sinner or not. But I do know one thing. I used to be blind
 but now I can see.\u201d","The Jews asked him
 \u201cWhat did he do to you? How did he give you sight?\u201d","The man replied
 \u201cI\u2019ve already told you
 but you didn\u2019t listen. Why do you want to hear the story again? Do you want to become his disciples too?\u201d","Yeshua heard that the Jews had thrown the man out of the synagogue. So when Yeshua found the man
 he asked him
 \u201cDo you believe in the Son of Man?\u201d","Yeshua told him
 \u201cYou\u2019ve seen him. He is the person who is now talking with you.\u201d","Then Yeshua said
 \u201cI have come into this world to judge: Blind people will be given sight
 and those who can see will become blind.\u201d","Yeshua told them
 \u201cIf you were blind
 you wouldn\u2019t be sinners. But now you say
 \u2018We see
\u2019 so you continue to be sinners.","\u201cI can guarantee this truth: The person who doesn\u2019t enter the sheep pen through the gate but climbs in somewhere else is a thief or a robber.","But the one who enters through the gate is the shepherd.","The gatekeeper opens the gate for him
 and the sheep respond to his voice. He calls his sheep by name and leads them out of the pen. ","After he has brought out all his sheep
 he walks ahead of them. The sheep follow him because they recognize his voice. ","They won\u2019t follow a stranger. Instead
 they will run away from a stranger because they don\u2019t recognize his voice.\u201d ","Yeshua emphasized
 \u201cI can guarantee this truth: I am the gate for the sheep. ","All who came before I did were thieves or robbers. However
 the sheep didn\u2019t respond to them. ","I am the gate. Those who enter the sheep pen through me will be saved. They will go in and out of the sheep pen and find food.","A thief comes to steal
 kill
 and destroy. But I came so that my sheep will have life and so that they will have everything they need.","\u201cI am the good shepherd. The good shepherd gives his life for the sheep.","A hired hand isn\u2019t a shepherd and doesn\u2019t own the sheep. When he sees a wolf coming
 he abandons the sheep and quickly runs away. So the wolf drags the sheep away and scatters the flock. ","The hired hand is concerned about what he\u2019s going to get paid and not about the sheep.","\u201cI am the good shepherd. I know my sheep as the Father knows me. My sheep know me as I know the Father.","So I give my life for my sheep.","I also have other sheep that are not from this pen. I must lead them. They
 too
 will respond to my voice. So they will be one flock with one shepherd. ","The Father loves me because I give my life in order to take it back again.","No one takes my life from me. I give my life of my own free will. I have the authority to give my life
 and I have the authority to take my life back again. This is what my Father ordered me to do.\u201d","Yeshua answered them
 \u201cI\u2019ve told you
 but you don\u2019t believe me. The things that I do in my Father\u2019s name testify on my behalf. ","However
 you don\u2019t believe because you\u2019re not my sheep. ","My sheep respond to my voice
 and I know who they are. They follow me
 ","and I give them eternal life. They will never be lost
 and no one will tear them away from me. ","My Father
 who gave them to me
 is greater than everyone else
 and no one can tear them away from my Father. ","The Father and I are one.\u201d","Yeshua replied to them
 \u201cI\u2019ve shown you many good things that come from the Father. For which of these good things do you want to stone me to death?\u201d","Yeshua said to them
 \u201cDon\u2019t your Scriptures say
 \u2018I said
 \u201cYou are gods\u201d \u2019? ","The Scriptures cannot be discredited. So if God calls people gods (and they are the people to whom he gave the Scriptures)
 ","why do you say that I\u2019m dishonoring God because I said
 \u2018I\u2019m the Son of God\u2019? God set me apart for this holy purpose and has sent me into the world. ","If I\u2019m not doing the things my Father does
 don\u2019t believe me. ","But if I\u2019m doing those things and you refuse to believe me
 then at least believe the things that I\u2019m doing. Then you will know and recognize that the Father is in me and that I am in the Father.\u201d","When Yeshua heard the message
 he said
 \u201cHis sickness won\u2019t result in death. Instead
 this sickness will bring glory to God so that the Son of God will receive glory through it.\u201d","Then
 after the two days
 Yeshua said to his disciples
 \u201cLet\u2019s go back to Judea.\u201d","Yeshua answered
 \u201cAren\u2019t there twelve hours of daylight? Those who walk during the day don\u2019t stumble
 because they see the light of this world. ","However
 those who walk at night stumble because they have no light in themselves.\u201d","After Yeshua said this
 he told his disciples
 \u201cOur friend Lazarus is sleeping
 and I\u2019m going to Bethany to wake him.\u201d","Then Yeshua told them plainly
 \u201cLazarus has died
 ","but I\u2019m glad that I wasn\u2019t there so that you can grow in faith. Let\u2019s go to Lazarus.\u201d","Thomas
 who was called Didymus
 said to the rest of the disciples
 \u201cLet\u2019s go so that we
 too
 can die with Yeshua.\u201d","Yeshua told Martha
 \u201cYour brother will come back to life.\u201d","Yeshua said to her
 \u201cI am the one who brings people back to life

 \u201cYes
 Lord
 I believe that you are the Messiah
 the Son of God
 the one who was expected to come into the world.\u201d","When Mary arrived where Yeshua was and saw him
 she knelt at his feet and said
 \u201cLord
 if you had been here
 my brother would not have died.\u201d","So Yeshua asked
 \u201cWhere did you put Lazarus?\u201d They answered him
 \u201cLord
 come and see.\u201d","Yeshua said
 \u201cTake the stone away.\u201d Martha
 the dead man\u2019s sister
 told Yeshua
 \u201cLord
 there must already be a stench. He\u2019s been dead for four days.\u201d","Yeshua said to her
 \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you that if you believe
 you would see God\u2019s glory?\u201d ","So the stone was moved away from the entrance of the tomb. Yeshua looked up and said
 \u201cFather
 I thank you for hearing me. ","I\u2019ve known that you always hear me. However
 I\u2019ve said this so that the crowd standing around me will believe that you sent me.\u201d ","After Yeshua had said this
 he shouted as loudly as he could
 \u201cLazarus
 come out!\u201d","The dead man came out. Strips of cloth were wound around his feet and hands
 and his face was wrapped with a handkerchief. Yeshua told them
 \u201cFree Lazarus

 \u201cLeave her alone! She has done this to prepare me for the day I will be placed in a tomb. ","You will always have the poor with you
 but you will not always have me with you.\u201d","The people who had been with Yeshua when he called Lazarus from the tomb and brought him back to life reported what they had seen.","The Pharisees said to each other
 \u201cThis is getting us nowhere. Look! The whole world is following him!\u201d","They went to Philip (who was from Bethsaida in Galilee) and told him
 \u201cSir

 \u201cThe time has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. ","I can guarantee this truth: A single grain of wheat doesn\u2019t produce anything unless it is planted in the ground and dies. If it dies
 it will produce a lot of grain. ","Those who love their lives will destroy them
 and those who hate their lives in this world will guard them for everlasting life. ","Those who serve me must follow me. My servants will be with me wherever I will be. If people serve me
 the Father will honor them.","\u201cI am too deeply troubled now to know how to express my feelings. Should I say
 \u2018Father
 save me from this time of suffering\u2019? No! I came for this time of suffering. ","Father
 give glory to your name.\u201d A voice from heaven said
 \u201cI have given it glory
 and I will give it glory again.\u201d","Yeshua replied
 \u201cThat voice wasn\u2019t for my benefit but for yours.","\u201cThis world is being judged now. The ruler of this world will be thrown out now.","When I have been lifted up from the earth
 I will draw all people toward me.\u201d ","Yeshua answered the crowd
 \u201cThe light will still be with you for a little while. Walk while you have light so that darkness won\u2019t defeat you. Those who walk in the dark don\u2019t know where they\u2019re going. ","While you have the light
 believe in the light so that you will become people whose lives show the light.\u201d After Yeshua had said this
 he was concealed as he left. ","Then Yeshua said loudly
 \u201cWhoever believes in me believes not only in me but also in the one who sent me. ","Whoever sees me sees the one who sent me.","I am the light that has come into the world so that everyone who believes in me will not live in the dark.","If anyone hears my words and doesn\u2019t follow them
 I don\u2019t condemn them. I didn\u2019t come to condemn the world but to save the world. ","Those who reject me by not accepting what I say have a judge appointed for them. The words that I have spoken will judge them on the last day.","I have not spoken on my own. Instead
 the Father who sent me told me what I should say and how I should say it. ","I know that what he commands is eternal life. Whatever I say is what the Father told me to say.\u201d","Yeshua answered Peter
 \u201cYou don\u2019t know now what I\u2019m doing. You will understand later.\u201d","Peter told Yeshua
 \u201cYou will never wash my feet.\u201d Yeshua replied to Peter
 \u201cIf I don\u2019t wash you
 you don\u2019t belong to me.\u201d","Yeshua told Peter
 \u201cPeople who have washed are completely clean. They need to have only their feet washed. All of you
 except for one
 are clean.\u201d ","(Yeshua knew who was going to betray him. That\u2019s why he said
 \u201cAll of you
 except for one
 are clean.\u201d)","After Yeshua had washed their feet and put on his outer clothes
 he took his place at the table again. Then he asked his disciples
 \u201cDo you understand what I\u2019ve done for you? ","You call me teacher and Lord

 your Lord and teacher
 have washed your feet
 you must wash each other\u2019s feet. ","I\u2019ve given you an example that you should follow.","I can guarantee this truth: Slaves are not superior to their owners
 and messengers are not superior to the people who send them. ","If you understand all of this
 you are blessed whenever you follow my example.","\u201cI\u2019m not talking about all of you. I know the people I\u2019ve chosen to be apostles. However
 I\u2019ve made my choice so that Scripture will come true. It says
 \u2018The one who eats my bread has turned against me.\u2019 ","I\u2019m telling you now before it happens. Then
 when it happens
 you will believe that I am the one.","\u201cI can guarantee this truth: Whoever accepts me accepts the one who sent me.\u201d","After saying this
 Yeshua was deeply troubled. He declared
 \u201cI can guarantee this truth: One of you is going to betray me!\u201d","Yeshua answered
 \u201cHe\u2019s the one to whom I will give this piece of bread after I\u2019ve dipped it in the sauce.\u201d So Yeshua dipped the bread and gave it to Judas
 son of Simon Iscariot.","Then
 after Judas took the piece of bread
 Satan entered him. So Yeshua told him
 \u201cHurry! Do what you have to do.\u201d ","When Judas was gone
 Yeshua said
 \u201cThe Son of Man is now glorified

 God will glorify the Son of Man because of himself

 \u201cDear children
 I will still be with you for a little while. I\u2019m telling you what I told the Jews. You will look for me
 but you can\u2019t go where I\u2019m going.","\u201cI\u2019m giving you a new commandment: Love each other in the same way that I have loved you.","Everyone will know that you are my disciples because of your love for each other.\u201d","Simon Peter asked him
 \u201cLord
 where are you going?\u201d Yeshua answered him
 \u201cYou can\u2019t follow me now to the place where I\u2019m going. However
 you will follow me later.\u201d","Yeshua replied
 \u201cWill you give your life for me? I can guarantee this truth: No rooster will crow until you say three times that you don\u2019t know me.","\u201cDon\u2019t be troubled. Believe in God

 I will come again. Then I will bring you into my presence so that you will be where I am. ","You know the way to the place where I am going.\u201d","Yeshua answered him
 \u201cI am the way

 \u201cI have been with all of you for a long time. Don\u2019t you know me yet

 I will do it.","\u201cIf you love me
 you will obey my commandments. ","I will ask the Father

 \u201cLord

 \u2018I\u2019m going away

 you would be glad that I\u2019m going to the Father
 because the Father is greater than I am.","\u201cI\u2019m telling you this now before it happens. When it does happen
 you will believe. ","The ruler of this world has no power over me. But he\u2019s coming
 so I won\u2019t talk with you much longer. ","However
 I want the world to know that I love the Father and that I am doing exactly what the Father has commanded me to do. Get up! We have to leave.\u201d","Then Yeshua said
 \u201cI am the true vine
 and my Father takes care of the vineyard. ","He removes every one of my branches that doesn\u2019t produce fruit. He also prunes every branch that does produce fruit to make it produce more fruit.","\u201cYou are already clean because of what I have told you.","Live in me

 you cannot produce fruit unless you live in me.","\u201cI am the vine. You are the branches. Those who live in me while I live in them will produce a lot of fruit. But you can\u2019t produce anything without me.","Whoever doesn\u2019t live in me is thrown away like a branch and dries up. Branches like this are gathered
 thrown into a fire
 and burned. ","If you live in me and what I say lives in you

 realize that it hated me before it hated you. ","If you had anything in common with the world
 the world would love you as one of its own. But you don\u2019t have anything in common with the world. I chose you from the world

 they will also persecute you. If they did what I said
 they will also do what you say. ","Indeed
 they will do all this to you because you are committed to me

 they wouldn\u2019t have any sin. But now they have no excuse for their sin. ","The person who hates me also hates my Father.","If I hadn\u2019t done among them what no one else has done
 they wouldn\u2019t have any sin. But now they have seen and hated both me and my Father. ","In this way what is written in their Scriptures has come true: \u2018They hate me for no reason.\u2019","\u201cThe helper whom I will send to you from the Father will come. This helper

 too
 because you have been with me from the beginning.\u201d","Yeshua continued
 \u201cI have said these things to you so that you won\u2019t lose your faith. ","You will be thrown out of synagogues. Certainly
 the time is coming when people who murder you will think that they are serving God. ","They will do these things to you because they haven\u2019t known the Father or me.","But I\u2019ve told you this so that when it happens you\u2019ll remember what I\u2019ve told you.

 none of you asks me where I\u2019m going. ","But because I\u2019ve told you this
 you\u2019re filled with sadness. ","However
 I am telling you the truth: It\u2019s good for you that I\u2019m going away. If I don\u2019t go away
 the helper won\u2019t come to you. But if I go
 I will send him to you. ","He will come to convict the world of sin
 to show the world what has God\u2019s approval
 and to convince the world that God judges it. ","He will convict the world of sin
 because people don\u2019t believe in me. ","He will show the world what has God\u2019s approval
 because I\u2019m going to the Father and you won\u2019t see me anymore. ","He will convince the world that God judges it
 because the ruler of this world has been judged.","\u201cI have a lot more to tell you
 but that would be too much for you now. ","When the Spirit of Truth comes
 he will guide you into the full truth. He won\u2019t speak on his own. He will speak what he hears and will tell you about things to come. ","He will give me glory
 because he will tell you what I say. ","Everything the Father says is also what I say. That is why I said
 \u2018He will take what I say and tell it to you.\u2019","\u201cIn a little while you won\u2019t see me anymore. Then in a little while you will see me again.\u201d","Some of his disciples said to each other
 \u201cWhat does he mean? He tells us that in a little while we won\u2019t see him. Then he tells us that in a little while we will see him again and that he\u2019s going to the Father.\u201d ","So they were asking each other
 \u201cWhat does he mean when he says
 \u2018In a little while\u2019? We don\u2019t understand what he\u2019s talking about.\u201d","Yeshua knew they wanted to ask him something. So he said to them
 \u201cAre you trying to figure out among yourselves what I meant when I said
 \u2018In a little while you won\u2019t see me
 and in a little while you will see me again\u2019? ","I can guarantee this truth: You will cry because you are sad
 but the world will be happy. You will feel pain
 but your pain will turn to happiness. ","A woman has pain when her time to give birth comes. But after the child is born
 she doesn\u2019t remember the pain anymore because she\u2019s happy that a child has been brought into the world.","\u201cNow you\u2019re in a painful situation. But I will see you again. Then you will be happy
 and no one will take that happiness away from you. ","When that day comes
 you won\u2019t ask me any more questions. I can guarantee this truth: If you ask the Father for anything in my name
 he will give it to you. ","So far you haven\u2019t asked for anything in my name. Ask and you will receive so that you can be completely happy.","\u201cI have used examples to illustrate these things. The time is coming when I won\u2019t use examples to speak to you. Rather
 I will speak to you about the Father in plain words. ","When that day comes
 you will ask for what you want in my name. I\u2019m telling you that I won\u2019t have to ask the Father for you. ","The Father loves you because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God.","I left the Father and came into the world. Again
 as I\u2019ve said
 I\u2019m going to leave the world and go back to the Father.\u201d","Yeshua replied to them
 \u201cNow you believe. ","The time is coming
 and is already here

 Yeshua looked up to heaven and said
 \u201cFather

 \u201cDid you think of that yourself

 do you love me more than the other disciples do?\u201d Peter answered him
 \u201cYes
 Lord
 you know that I love you.\u201d Yeshua told him
 \u201cFeed my lambs.\u201d","Yeshua asked him again
 a second time
 \u201cSimon
 son of John
 do you love me?\u201d Peter answered him
 \u201cYes
 Lord
 you know that I love you.\u201d Yeshua told him
 \u201cTake care of my sheep.\u201d","Yeshua asked him a third time
 \u201cSimon
 son of John
 do you love me?\u201d Peter felt sad because Yeshua had asked him a third time
 \u201cDo you love me?\u201d So Peter said to him
 \u201cLord
 you know everything. You know that I love you.\u201d Yeshua told him
 \u201cFeed my sheep. ","I can guarantee this truth: When you were young
 you would get ready to go where you wanted. But when you\u2019re old
 you will stretch out your hands
 and someone else will get you ready to take you where you don\u2019t want to go.\u201d ","Yeshua said this to show by what kind of death Peter would bring glory to God. After saying this
 Yeshua told Peter
 \u201cFollow me!\u201d","Yeshua said to Peter
 \u201cIf I want him to live until I come again
 how does that concern you? Follow me!\u201d ","So a rumor that that disciple wouldn\u2019t die spread among Yeshua\u2019s followers. But Yeshua didn\u2019t say that he wouldn\u2019t die. What Yeshua said was
 \u201cIf I want him to live until I come again
 how does that concern you?\u201d","And they asked him
 \u2018What then? Are you Elijah?\u2019 He said
 \u2018I am not.\u2019 \u2018Are you the prophet?\u2019 He answered
 \u2018No.\u2019 ","Then they said to him
 \u2018Who are you? Let us have an answer for those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?\u2019 ","He said
 \u2018I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness
 \u201cMake straight the way of the Lord\u201d\u2019
 as the prophet Isaiah said.","When Jesus turned and saw them following
 he said to them
 \u2018What are you looking for?\u2019 They said to him
 \u2018Rabbi\u2019 (which translated means Teacher)
 \u2018where are you staying?\u2019 ","He said to them
 \u2018Come and see.\u2019 They came and saw where he was staying
 and they remained with him that day. It was about four o\u2019clock in the afternoon. ","He brought Simon to Jesus
 who looked at him and said
 \u2018You are Simon son of John. You are to be called Cephas\u2019 (which is translated Peter).","The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee. He found Philip and said to him
 \u2018Follow me.\u2019 ","Philip found Nathanael and said to him
 \u2018We have found him about whom Moses in the law and also the prophets wrote
 Jesus son of Joseph from Nazareth.\u2019 ","Nathanael said to him
 \u2018Can anything good come out of Nazareth?\u2019 Philip said to him
 \u2018Come and see.\u2019 ","When Jesus saw Nathanael coming towards him
 he said of him
 \u2018Here is truly an Israelite in whom there is no deceit!\u2019 ","Nathanael asked him
 \u2018Where did you come to know me?\u2019 Jesus answered
 \u2018I saw you under the fig tree before Philip called you.\u2019 ","Jesus answered
 \u2018Do you believe because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree? You will see greater things than these.\u2019 ","And he said to him
 \u2018Very truly
 I tell you
 you will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.\u2019","And Jesus said to her
 \u2018Woman
 what concern is that to you and to me? My hour has not yet come.\u2019 ","Jesus said to them
 \u2018Fill the jars with water.\u2019 And they filled them up to the brim. ","He said to them
 \u2018Now draw some out
 and take it to the chief steward.\u2019 So they took it. ","He told those who were selling the doves
 \u2018Take these things out of here! Stop making my Father\u2019s house a market-place!\u2019 ","Jesus answered them
 \u2018Destroy this temple
 and in three days I will raise it up.\u2019 ","Jesus answered him
 \u2018Very truly
 I tell you
 no one can see the kingdom of God without being born from above.\u2019 ","Jesus answered
 \u2018Very truly
 I tell you
 no one can enter the kingdom of God without being born of water and Spirit. ","What is born of the flesh is flesh
 and what is born of the Spirit is spirit. ","Do not be astonished that I said to you
 \u201cYou must be born from above.\u201d ","The wind blows where it chooses
 and you hear the sound of it
 but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.\u2019 ","Jesus answered him
 \u2018Are you a teacher of Israel
 and yet you do not understand these things?","\u2018Very truly
 I tell you
 we speak of what we know and testify to what we have seen; yet you do not receive our testimony. ","If I have told you about earthly things and you do not believe
 how can you believe if I tell you about heavenly things? ","No one has ascended into heaven except the one who descended from heaven
 the Son of Man. ","And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness
 so must the Son of Man be lifted up
 ","that whoever believes in him may have eternal life.","\u2018For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son
 so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life.","\u2018Indeed
 God did not send the Son into the world to condemn the world
 but in order that the world might be saved through him. ","Those who believe in him are not condemned; but those who do not believe are condemned already
 because they have not believed in the name of the only Son of God. ","And this is the judgement
 that the light has come into the world
 and people loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil. ","For all who do evil hate the light and do not come to the light
 so that their deeds may not be exposed. ","But those who do what is true come to the light
 so that it may be clearly seen that their deeds have been done in God.\u2019","They came to John and said to him
 \u2018Rabbi
 the one who was with you across the Jordan
 to whom you testified
 here he is baptizing
 and all are going to him.\u2019 ","A Samaritan woman came to draw water
 and Jesus said to her
 \u2018Give me a drink\u2019. ","Jesus answered her
 \u2018If you knew the gift of God
 and who it is that is saying to you
 \u201cGive me a drink\u201d
 you would have asked him
 and he would have given you living water.\u2019 ","Jesus said to her
 \u2018Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again
 ","but those who drink of the water that I will give them will never be thirsty. The water that I will give will become in them a spring of water gushing up to eternal life.\u2019","The woman said to him
 \u2018Sir
 give me this water
 so that I may never be thirsty or have to keep coming here to draw water.\u2019","Jesus said to her
 \u2018Go
 call your husband
 and come back.\u2019 ","The woman answered him
 \u2018I have no husband.\u2019 Jesus said to her
 \u2018You are right in saying
 \u201cI have no husband\u201d; ","for you have had five husbands
 and the one you have now is not your husband. What you have said is true!\u2019 ","Jesus said to her
 \u2018Woman
 believe me
 the hour is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem. ","You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know
 for salvation is from the Jews. ","But the hour is coming
 and is now here
 when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth
 for the Father seeks such as these to worship him. ","God is spirit
 and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.\u2019 ","Jesus said to her
 \u2018I am he
 the one who is speaking to you.\u2019","But he said to them
 \u2018I have food to eat that you do not know about.\u2019 ","Jesus said to them
 \u2018My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to complete his work. ","Do you not say
 \u201cFour months more
 then comes the harvest\u201d? But I tell you
 look around you
 and see how the fields are ripe for harvesting. ","The reaper is already receiving wages and is gathering fruit for eternal life
 so that sower and reaper may rejoice together. ","For here the saying holds true
 \u201cOne sows and another reaps.\u201d ","I sent you to reap that for which you did not labour. Others have laboured
 and you have entered into their labour.\u2019","They said to the woman
 \u2018It is no longer because of what you said that we believe
 for we have heard for ourselves
 and we know that this is truly the Saviour of the world.\u2019","Then Jesus said to him
 \u2018Unless you see signs and wonders you will not believe.\u2019 ","Jesus said to him
 \u2018Go; your son will live.\u2019 The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and started on his way. ","So he asked them the hour when he began to recover
 and they said to him
 \u2018Yesterday at one in the afternoon the fever left him.\u2019 ","The father realized that this was the hour when Jesus had said to him
 \u2018Your son will live.\u2019 So he himself believed
 along with his whole household. ","When Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had been there a long time
 he said to him
 \u2018Do you want to be made well?\u2019 ","Jesus said to him
 \u2018Stand up
 take your mat and walk.\u2019 ","But he answered them
 \u2018The man who made me well said to me
 \u201cTake up your mat and walk.\u201d\u2019 ","Later Jesus found him in the temple and said to him
 \u2018See
 you have been made well! Do not sin any more
 so that nothing worse happens to you.\u2019 ","But Jesus answered them
 \u2018My Father is still working
 and I also am working.\u2019 ","Jesus said to them
 \u2018Very truly
 I tell you
 the Son can do nothing on his own
 but only what he sees the Father doing; for whatever the Father does
 the Son does likewise. ","The Father loves the Son and shows him all that he himself is doing; and he will show him greater works than these
 so that you will be astonished. ","Indeed
 just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life
 so also the Son gives life to whomsoever he wishes. ","The Father judges no one but has given all judgement to the Son
 ","so that all may honour the Son just as they honour the Father. Anyone who does not honour the Son does not honour the Father who sent him.","Very truly
 I tell you
 anyone who hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life
 and does not come under judgement
 but has passed from death to life.","\u2018Very truly
 I tell you
 the hour is coming
 and is now here
 when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God
 and those who hear will live. ","For just as the Father has life in himself
 so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself; ","and he has given him authority to execute judgement
 because he is the Son of Man. ","Do not be astonished at this; for the hour is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice","and will come out\u2014those who have done good
 to the resurrection of life
 and those who have done evil
 to the resurrection of condemnation.","\u2018I can do nothing on my own. As I hear
 I judge; and my judgement is just
 because I seek to do not my own will but the will of him who sent me.","\u2018If I testify about myself
 my testimony is not true. ","There is another who testifies on my behalf
 and I know that his testimony to me is true. ","You sent messengers to John
 and he testified to the truth. ","Not that I accept such human testimony
 but I say these things so that you may be saved. ","He was a burning and shining lamp
 and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light. ","But I have a testimony greater than John\u2019s. The works that the Father has given me to complete
 the very works that I am doing
 testify on my behalf that the Father has sent me. ","And the Father who sent me has himself testified on my behalf. You have never heard his voice or seen his form
 ","and you do not have his word abiding in you
 because you do not believe him whom he has sent.","\u2018You search the scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is they that testify on my behalf.","Yet you refuse to come to me to have life.","I do not accept glory from human beings.","But I know that you do not have the love of God in you.","I have come in my Father\u2019s name
 and you do not accept me; if another comes in his own name
 you will accept him. ","How can you believe when you accept glory from one another and do not seek the glory that comes from the one who alone is God?","Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father; your accuser is Moses
 on whom you have set your hope. ","If you believed Moses
 you would believe me
 for he wrote about me. ","But if you do not believe what he wrote
 how will you believe what I say?\u2019","When he looked up and saw a large crowd coming towards him
 Jesus said to Philip
 \u2018Where are we to buy bread for these people to eat?\u2019 ","Jesus said
 \u2018Make the people sit down.\u2019 Now there was a great deal of grass in the place; so they sat down
 about five thousand in all. ","When they were satisfied
 he told his disciples
 \u2018Gather up the fragments left over
 so that nothing may be lost.\u2019 ","But he said to them
 \u2018It is I; do not be afraid.\u2019 ","Jesus answered them
 \u2018Very truly
 I tell you
 you are looking for me
 not because you saw signs
 but because you ate your fill of the loaves. ","Do not work for the food that perishes
 but for the food that endures for eternal life
 which the Son of Man will give you. For it is on him that God the Father has set his seal.\u2019 ","Jesus answered them
 \u2018This is the work of God
 that you believe in him whom he has sent.\u2019 ","Then Jesus said to them
 \u2018Very truly
 I tell you
 it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven
 but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven. ","For the bread of God is that which comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.\u2019","Jesus said to them
 \u2018I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never be hungry
 and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty. ","But I said to you that you have seen me and yet do not believe.","Everything that the Father gives me will come to me
 and anyone who comes to me I will never drive away; ","for I have come down from heaven
 not to do my own will
 but the will of him who sent me. ","And this is the will of him who sent me
 that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me
 but raise it up on the last day. ","This is indeed the will of my Father
 that all who see the Son and believe in him may have eternal life; and I will raise them up on the last day.\u2019","Jesus answered them
 \u2018Do not complain among yourselves. ","No one can come to me unless drawn by the Father who sent me; and I will raise that person up on the last day.","It is written in the prophets
 \u201cAnd they shall all be taught by God.\u201d Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me. ","Not that anyone has seen the Father except the one who is from God; he has seen the Father.","Very truly
 I tell you
 whoever believes has eternal life. ","I am the bread of life.","Your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness
 and they died. ","This is the bread that comes down from heaven
 so that one may eat of it and not die. ","I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Whoever eats of this bread will live for ever; and the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.\u2019","So Jesus said to them
 \u2018Very truly
 I tell you
 unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood
 you have no life in you. ","Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood have eternal life
 and I will raise them up on the last day; ","for my flesh is true food and my blood is true drink.","Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood abide in me
 and I in them. ","Just as the living Father sent me
 and I live because of the Father
 so whoever eats me will live because of me. ","This is the bread that came down from heaven
 not like that which your ancestors ate
 and they died. But the one who eats this bread will live for ever.\u2019 ","But Jesus
 being aware that his disciples were complaining about it
 said to them
 \u2018Does this offend you? ","Then what if you were to see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before?","It is the spirit that gives life; the flesh is useless. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life.","But among you there are some who do not believe.\u2019 For Jesus knew from the first who were the ones that did not believe
 and who was the one that would betray him. ","And he said
 \u2018For this reason I have told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted by the Father.\u2019","So Jesus asked the twelve
 \u2018Do you also wish to go away?\u2019 ","Jesus answered them
 \u2018Did I not choose you
 the twelve? Yet one of you is a devil.\u2019 ","So his brothers said to him
 \u2018Leave here and go to Judea so that your disciples also may see the works you are doing; ","Jesus said to them
 \u2018My time has not yet come
 but your time is always here. ","The world cannot hate you
 but it hates me because I testify against it that its works are evil. ","Go to the festival yourselves. I am not going to this festival
 for my time has not yet fully come.\u2019 ","Then Jesus answered them
 \u2018My teaching is not mine but his who sent me. ","Anyone who resolves to do the will of God will know whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own.","Those who speak on their own seek their own glory; but the one who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true
 and there is nothing false in him.","\u2018Did not Moses give you the law? Yet none of you keeps the law. Why are you looking for an opportunity to kill me?\u2019","Jesus answered them
 \u2018I performed one work
 and all of you are astonished. ","Moses gave you circumcision (it is
 of course
 not from Moses
 but from the patriarchs)
 and you circumcise a man on the sabbath. ","If a man receives circumcision on the sabbath in order that the law of Moses may not be broken
 are you angry with me because I healed a man\u2019s whole body on the sabbath? ","Do not judge by appearances
 but judge with right judgement.\u2019","Now some of the people of Jerusalem were saying
 \u2018Is not this the man whom they are trying to kill? ","Then Jesus cried out as he was teaching in the temple
 \u2018You know me
 and you know where I am from. I have not come on my own. But the one who sent me is true
 and you do not know him. ","I know him
 because I am from him
 and he sent me.\u2019 ","Jesus then said
 \u2018I will be with you a little while longer
 and then I am going to him who sent me. ","You will search for me
 but you will not find me; and where I am
 you cannot come.\u2019 ","The Jews said to one another
 \u2018Where does this man intend to go that we will not find him? Does he intend to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks? ","On the last day of the festival
 the great day
 while Jesus was standing there
 he cried out
 \u2018Let anyone who is thirsty come to me
 ","and let the one who believes in me drink. As the scripture has said
 \u201cOut of the believer\u2019s heart shall flow rivers of living water.\u201d\u2019 ","Now he said this about the Spirit
 which believers in him were to receive; for as yet there was no Spirit
 because Jesus was not yet glorified.","they said to him
 \u2018Teacher
 this woman was caught in the very act of committing adultery. ","When they kept on questioning him
 he straightened up and said to them
 \u2018Let anyone among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.\u2019 ","Jesus straightened up and said to her
 \u2018Woman
 where are they? Has no one condemned you?\u2019 ","She said
 \u2018No one
 sir.\u2019 And Jesus said
 \u2018Neither do I condemn you. Go your way
 and from now on do not sin again.\u2019]]","Again Jesus spoke to them
 saying
 \u2018I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness but will have the light of life.\u2019 ","Jesus answered
 \u2018Even if I testify on my own behalf
 my testimony is valid because I know where I have come from and where I am going
 but you do not know where I come from or where I am going. ","You judge by human standards; I judge no one.","Yet even if I do judge
 my judgement is valid; for it is not I alone who judge
 but I and the Father who sent me. ","In your law it is written that the testimony of two witnesses is valid.","I testify on my own behalf
 and the Father who sent me testifies on my behalf.\u2019 ","Then they said to him
 \u2018Where is your Father?\u2019 Jesus answered
 \u2018You know neither me nor my Father. If you knew me
 you would know my Father also.\u2019 ","Again he said to them
 \u2018I am going away
 and you will search for me
 but you will die in your sin. Where I am going
 you cannot come.\u2019 ","He said to them
 \u2018You are from below
 I am from above; you are of this world
 I am not of this world. ","I told you that you would die in your sins
 for you will die in your sins unless you believe that I am he.\u2019 ","They said to him
 \u2018Who are you?\u2019 Jesus said to them
 \u2018Why do I speak to you at all? ","I have much to say about you and much to condemn; but the one who sent me is true
 and I declare to the world what I have heard from him.\u2019 ","So Jesus said
 \u2018When you have lifted up the Son of Man
 then you will realize that I am he
 and that I do nothing on my own
 but I speak these things as the Father instructed me. ","And the one who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone
 for I always do what is pleasing to him.\u2019 ","Then Jesus said to the Jews who had believed in him
 \u2018If you continue in my word
 you are truly my disciples; ","and you will know the truth
 and the truth will make you free.\u2019 ","Jesus answered them
 \u2018Very truly
 I tell you
 everyone who commits sin is a slave to sin. ","The slave does not have a permanent place in the household; the son has a place there for ever.","So if the Son makes you free
 you will be free indeed. ","I know that you are descendants of Abraham; yet you look for an opportunity to kill me
 because there is no place in you for my word. ","I declare what I have seen in the Father\u2019s presence; as for you
 you should do what you have heard from the Father.\u2019","They answered him
 \u2018Abraham is our father.\u2019 Jesus said to them
 \u2018If you were Abraham\u2019s children
 you would be doing what Abraham did
 ","but now you are trying to kill me
 a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. This is not what Abraham did. ","You are indeed doing what your father does.\u2019 They said to him
 \u2018We are not illegitimate children; we have one father
 God himself.\u2019 ","Jesus said to them
 \u2018If God were your Father
 you would love me
 for I came from God and now I am here. I did not come on my own
 but he sent me. ","Why do you not understand what I say? It is because you cannot accept my word.","You are from your father the devil
 and you choose to do your father\u2019s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth
 because there is no truth in him. When he lies
 he speaks according to his own nature
 for he is a liar and the father of lies. ","But because I tell the truth
 you do not believe me. ","Which of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth
 why do you not believe me? ","Whoever is from God hears the words of God. The reason you do not hear them is that you are not from God.\u2019","Jesus answered
 \u2018I do not have a demon; but I honour my Father
 and you dishonour me. ","Yet I do not seek my own glory; there is one who seeks it and he is the judge.","Very truly
 I tell you
 whoever keeps my word will never see death.\u2019 ","The Jews said to him
 \u2018Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham died
 and so did the prophets; yet you say
 \u201cWhoever keeps my word will never taste death.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u2018If I glorify myself
 my glory is nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me
 he of whom you say
 \u201cHe is our God\u201d
 ","though you do not know him. But I know him; if I were to say that I do not know him
 I would be a liar like you. But I do know him and I keep his word. ","Your ancestor Abraham rejoiced that he would see my day; he saw it and was glad.\u2019","Jesus said to them
 \u2018Very truly
 I tell you
 before Abraham was
 I am.\u2019 ","Jesus answered
 \u2018Neither this man nor his parents sinned; he was born blind so that God\u2019s works might be revealed in him. ","We must work the works of him who sent me while it is day; night is coming when no one can work.","As long as I am in the world
 I am the light of the world.\u2019 ","saying to him
 \u2018Go
 wash in the pool of Siloam\u2019 (which means Sent). Then he went and washed and came back able to see. ","He answered
 \u2018The man called Jesus made mud
 spread it on my eyes
 and said to me
 \u201cGo to Siloam and wash.\u201d Then I went and washed and received my sight.\u2019 ","They said to him
 \u2018Where is he?\u2019 He said
 \u2018I do not know.\u2019","So for the second time they called the man who had been blind
 and they said to him
 \u2018Give glory to God! We know that this man is a sinner.\u2019 ","He answered
 \u2018I do not know whether he is a sinner. One thing I do know
 that though I was blind
 now I see.\u2019 ","They said to him
 \u2018What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?\u2019 ","He answered them
 \u2018I have told you already
 and you would not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also want to become his disciples?\u2019 ","Jesus heard that they had driven him out
 and when he found him
 he said
 \u2018Do you believe in the Son of Man?\u2019 ","Jesus said to him
 \u2018You have seen him
 and the one speaking with you is he.\u2019 ","Jesus said
 \u2018I came into this world for judgement so that those who do not see may see
 and those who do see may become blind.\u2019 ","Jesus said to them
 \u2018If you were blind
 you would not have sin. But now that you say
 \u201cWe see\u201d
 your sin remains.","\u2018Very truly
 I tell you
 anyone who does not enter the sheepfold by the gate but climbs in by another way is a thief and a bandit. ","The one who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep.","The gatekeeper opens the gate for him
 and the sheep hear his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. ","When he has brought out all his own
 he goes ahead of them
 and the sheep follow him because they know his voice. ","They will not follow a stranger
 but they will run from him because they do not know the voice of strangers.\u2019 ","So again Jesus said to them
 \u2018Very truly
 I tell you
 I am the gate for the sheep. ","All who came before me are thieves and bandits; but the sheep did not listen to them.","I am the gate. Whoever enters by me will be saved
 and will come in and go out and find pasture. ","The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life
 and have it abundantly.","\u2018I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.","The hired hand
 who is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep
 sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and runs away\u2014and the wolf snatches them and scatters them. ","The hired hand runs away because a hired hand does not care for the sheep.","I am the good shepherd. I know my own and my own know me
 ","just as the Father knows me and I know the Father. And I lay down my life for the sheep.","I have other sheep that do not belong to this fold. I must bring them also
 and they will listen to my voice. So there will be one flock
 one shepherd. ","For this reason the Father loves me
 because I lay down my life in order to take it up again. ","No one takes it from me
 but I lay it down of my own accord. I have power to lay it down
 and I have power to take it up again. I have received this command from my Father.\u2019","Jesus answered
 \u2018I have told you
 and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father\u2019s name testify to me; ","but you do not believe
 because you do not belong to my sheep. ","My sheep hear my voice. I know them
 and they follow me. ","I give them eternal life
 and they will never perish. No one will snatch them out of my hand. ","What my Father has given me is greater than all else
 and no one can snatch it out of the Father\u2019s hand. ","The Father and I are one.\u2019","Jesus replied
 \u2018I have shown you many good works from the Father. For which of these are you going to stone me?\u2019 ","Jesus answered
 \u2018Is it not written in your law
 \u201cI said
 you are gods\u201d? ","If those to whom the word of God came were called \u201cgods\u201d\u2014and the scripture cannot be annulled\u2014","can you say that the one whom the Father has sanctified and sent into the world is blaspheming because I said
 \u201cI am God\u2019s Son\u201d? ","If I am not doing the works of my Father
 then do not believe me. ","But if I do them
 even though you do not believe me
 believe the works
 so that you may know and understand that the Father is in me and I am in the Father.\u2019 ","But when Jesus heard it
 he said
 \u2018This illness does not lead to death; rather it is for God\u2019s glory
 so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.\u2019 ","Then after this he said to the disciples
 \u2018Let us go to Judea again.\u2019 ","Jesus answered
 \u2018Are there not twelve hours of daylight? Those who walk during the day do not stumble
 because they see the light of this world. ","But those who walk at night stumble
 because the light is not in them.\u2019 ","After saying this
 he told them
 \u2018Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep
 but I am going there to awaken him.\u2019 ","Then Jesus told them plainly
 \u2018Lazarus is dead. ","For your sake I am glad I was not there
 so that you may believe. But let us go to him.\u2019 ","Thomas
 who was called the Twin
 said to his fellow-disciples
 \u2018Let us also go
 that we may die with him.\u2019","Jesus said to her
 \u2018Your brother will rise again.\u2019 ","Jesus said to her
 \u2018I am the resurrection and the life. Those who believe in me
 even though they die
 will live
 ","and everyone who lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?\u2019","She said to him
 \u2018Yes
 Lord
 I believe that you are the Messiah
 the Son of God
 the one coming into the world.\u2019","When Mary came where Jesus was and saw him
 she knelt at his feet and said to him
 \u2018Lord
 if you had been here
 my brother would not have died.\u2019 ","He said
 \u2018Where have you laid him?\u2019 They said to him
 \u2018Lord
 come and see.\u2019 ","Jesus said
 \u2018Take away the stone.\u2019 Martha
 the sister of the dead man
 said to him
 \u2018Lord
 already there is a stench because he has been dead for four days.\u2019 ","Jesus said to her
 \u2018Did I not tell you that if you believed
 you would see the glory of God?\u2019 ","So they took away the stone. And Jesus looked upwards and said
 \u2018Father
 I thank you for having heard me. ","I knew that you always hear me
 but I have said this for the sake of the crowd standing here
 so that they may believe that you sent me.\u2019 ","When he had said this
 he cried with a loud voice
 \u2018Lazarus
 come out!\u2019 ","The dead man came out
 his hands and feet bound with strips of cloth
 and his face wrapped in a cloth. Jesus said to them
 \u2018Unbind him
 and let him go.\u2019","Jesus said
 \u2018Leave her alone. She bought it so that she might keep it for the day of my burial. ","You always have the poor with you
 but you do not always have me.\u2019","So the crowd that had been with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to testify.","The Pharisees then said to one another
 \u2018You see
 you can do nothing. Look
 the world has gone after him!\u2019","They came to Philip
 who was from Bethsaida in Galilee
 and said to him
 \u2018Sir
 we wish to see Jesus.\u2019 ","Jesus answered them
 \u2018The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. ","Very truly
 I tell you
 unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies
 it remains just a single grain; but if it dies
 it bears much fruit. ","Those who love their life lose it
 and those who hate their life in this world will keep it for eternal life. ","Whoever serves me must follow me
 and where I am
 there will my servant be also. Whoever serves me
 the Father will honour.","\u2018Now my soul is troubled. And what should I say\u2014\u201cFather
 save me from this hour\u201d? No
 it is for this reason that I have come to this hour. ","Father
 glorify your name.\u2019 Then a voice came from heaven
 \u2018I have glorified it
 and I will glorify it again.\u2019 ","Jesus answered
 \u2018This voice has come for your sake
 not for mine. ","Now is the judgement of this world; now the ruler of this world will be driven out.","And I
 when I am lifted up from the earth
 will draw all people to myself.\u2019 ","Jesus said to them
 \u2018The light is with you for a little longer. Walk while you have the light
 so that the darkness may not overtake you. If you walk in the darkness
 you do not know where you are going. ","While you have the light
 believe in the light
 so that you may become children of light.\u2019 After Jesus had said this
 he departed and hid from them. ","Then Jesus cried aloud: \u2018Whoever believes in me believes not in me but in him who sent me.","And whoever sees me sees him who sent me.","I have come as light into the world
 so that everyone who believes in me should not remain in the darkness. ","I do not judge anyone who hears my words and does not keep them
 for I came not to judge the world
 but to save the world. ","The one who rejects me and does not receive my word has a judge; on the last day the word that I have spoken will serve as judge
 ","for I have not spoken on my own
 but the Father who sent me has himself given me a commandment about what to say and what to speak. ","And I know that his commandment is eternal life. What I speak
 therefore
 I speak just as the Father has told me.\u2019","Jesus answered
 \u2018You do not know now what I am doing
 but later you will understand.\u2019 ","Peter said to him
 \u2018You will never wash my feet.\u2019 Jesus answered
 \u2018Unless I wash you
 you have no share with me.\u2019 ","Jesus said to him
 \u2018One who has bathed does not need to wash
 except for the feet
 but is entirely clean. And you are clean
 though not all of you.\u2019 ","For he knew who was to betray him; for this reason he said
 \u2018Not all of you are clean.\u2019","After he had washed their feet
 had put on his robe
 and had returned to the table
 he said to them
 \u2018Do you know what I have done to you? ","You call me Teacher and Lord\u2014and you are right
 for that is what I am. ","So if I
 your Lord and Teacher
 have washed your feet
 you also ought to wash one another\u2019s feet. ","For I have set you an example
 that you also should do as I have done to you. ","Very truly
 I tell you
 servants are not greater than their master
 nor are messengers greater than the one who sent them. ","If you know these things
 you are blessed if you do them. ","I am not speaking of all of you; I know whom I have chosen. But it is to fulfil the scripture
 \u201cThe one who ate my bread has lifted his heel against me.\u201d ","I tell you this now
 before it occurs
 so that when it does occur
 you may believe that I am he. ","Very truly
 I tell you
 whoever receives one whom I send receives me; and whoever receives me receives him who sent me.\u2019","After saying this Jesus was troubled in spirit
 and declared
 \u2018Very truly
 I tell you
 one of you will betray me.\u2019 ","Jesus answered
 \u2018It is the one to whom I give this piece of bread when I have dipped it in the dish.\u2019 So when he had dipped the piece of bread
 he gave it to Judas son of Simon Iscariot. ","After he received the piece of bread
 Satan entered into him. Jesus said to him
 \u2018Do quickly what you are going to do.\u2019 ","When he had gone out
 Jesus said
 \u2018Now the Son of Man has been glorified
 and God has been glorified in him. ","If God has been glorified in him
 God will also glorify him in himself and will glorify him at once. ","Little children
 I am with you only a little longer. You will look for me; and as I said to the Jews so now I say to you
 \u201cWhere I am going
 you cannot come.\u201d ","I give you a new commandment
 that you love one another. Just as I have loved you
 you also should love one another. ","By this everyone will know that you are my disciples
 if you have love for one another.\u2019","Simon Peter said to him
 \u2018Lord
 where are you going?\u2019 Jesus answered
 \u2018Where I am going
 you cannot follow me now; but you will follow afterwards.\u2019 ","Jesus answered
 \u2018Will you lay down your life for me? Very truly
 I tell you
 before the cock crows
 you will have denied me three times.","\u2018Do not let your hearts be troubled. Believe in God
 believe also in me. ","In my Father\u2019s house there are many dwelling-places. If it were not so
 would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you? ","And if I go and prepare a place for you
 I will come again and will take you to myself
 so that where I am
 there you may be also. ","And you know the way to the place where I am going.\u2019","Jesus said to him
 \u2018I am the way
 and the truth
 and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. ","If you know me
 you will know my Father also. From now on you do know him and have seen him.\u2019","Jesus said to him
 \u2018Have I been with you all this time
 Philip
 and you still do not know me? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say
 \u201cShow us the Father\u201d? ","Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own; but the Father who dwells in me does his works.","Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; but if you do not
 then believe me because of the works themselves. ","Very truly
 I tell you
 the one who believes in me will also do the works that I do and
 in fact
 will do greater works than these
 because I am going to the Father. ","I will do whatever you ask in my name
 so that the Father may be glorified in the Son. ","If in my name you ask me for anything
 I will do it.","\u2018If you love me
 you will keep my commandments. ","And I will ask the Father
 and he will give you another Advocate
 to be with you for ever. ","This is the Spirit of truth
 whom the world cannot receive
 because it neither sees him nor knows him. You know him
 because he abides with you
 and he will be in you.","\u2018I will not leave you orphaned; I am coming to you.","In a little while the world will no longer see me
 but you will see me; because I live
 you also will live. ","On that day you will know that I am in my Father
 and you in me
 and I in you. ","They who have my commandments and keep them are those who love me; and those who love me will be loved by my Father
 and I will love them and reveal myself to them.\u2019 ","Judas (not Iscariot) said to him
 \u2018Lord
 how is it that you will reveal yourself to us
 and not to the world?\u2019 ","Jesus answered him
 \u2018Those who love me will keep my word
 and my Father will love them
 and we will come to them and make our home with them. ","Whoever does not love me does not keep my words; and the word that you hear is not mine
 but is from the Father who sent me.","\u2018I have said these things to you while I am still with you.","But the Advocate
 the Holy Spirit
 whom the Father will send in my name
 will teach you everything
 and remind you of all that I have said to you. ","Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled
 and do not let them be afraid. ","You heard me say to you
 \u201cI am going away
 and I am coming to you.\u201d If you loved me
 you would rejoice that I am going to the Father
 because the Father is greater than I. ","And now I have told you this before it occurs
 so that when it does occur
 you may believe. ","I will no longer talk much with you
 for the ruler of this world is coming. He has no power over me; ","but I do as the Father has commanded me
 so that the world may know that I love the Father. Rise
 let us be on our way.","\u2018I am the true vine
 and my Father is the vine-grower. ","He removes every branch in me that bears no fruit. Every branch that bears fruit he prunes to make it bear more fruit.","You have already been cleansed by the word that I have spoken to you.","Abide in me as I abide in you. Just as the branch cannot bear fruit by itself unless it abides in the vine
 neither can you unless you abide in me. ","I am the vine
 you are the branches. Those who abide in me and I in them bear much fruit
 because apart from me you can do nothing. ","Whoever does not abide in me is thrown away like a branch and withers; such branches are gathered
 thrown into the fire
 and burned. ","If you abide in me
 and my words abide in you
 ask for whatever you wish
 and it will be done for you. ","My Father is glorified by this
 that you bear much fruit and become my disciples. ","As the Father has loved me
 so I have loved you; abide in my love. ","If you keep my commandments
 you will abide in my love
 just as I have kept my Father\u2019s commandments and abide in his love. ","I have said these things to you so that my joy may be in you
 and that your joy may be complete.","\u2018This is my commandment
 that you love one another as I have loved you. ","No one has greater love than this
 to lay down one\u2019s life for one\u2019s friends. ","You are my friends if you do what I command you.","I do not call you servants any longer
 because the servant does not know what the master is doing; but I have called you friends
 because I have made known to you everything that I have heard from my Father. ","You did not choose me but I chose you. And I appointed you to go and bear fruit
 fruit that will last
 so that the Father will give you whatever you ask him in my name. ","I am giving you these commands so that you may love one another.","\u2018If the world hates you
 be aware that it hated me before it hated you. ","If you belonged to the world
 the world would love you as its own. Because you do not belong to the world
 but I have chosen you out of the world\u2014therefore the world hates you. ","Remember the word that I said to you
 \u201cServants are not greater than their master.\u201d If they persecuted me
 they will persecute you; if they kept my word
 they will keep yours also. ","But they will do all these things to you on account of my name
 because they do not know him who sent me. ","If I had not come and spoken to them
 they would not have sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin. ","Whoever hates me hates my Father also.","If I had not done among them the works that no one else did
 they would not have sin. But now they have seen and hated both me and my Father. ","It was to fulfil the word that is written in their law
 \u201cThey hated me without a cause.\u201d","\u2018When the Advocate comes
 whom I will send to you from the Father
 the Spirit of truth who comes from the Father
 he will testify on my behalf. ","You also are to testify because you have been with me from the beginning.","\u2018I have said these things to you to keep you from stumbling.","They will put you out of the synagogues. Indeed
 an hour is coming when those who kill you will think that by doing so they are offering worship to God. ","And they will do this because they have not known the Father or me.","But I have said these things to you so that when their hour comes you may remember that I told you about them. \u2018I did not say these things to you from the beginning
 because I was with you. ","But now I am going to him who sent me; yet none of you asks me
 \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d ","But because I have said these things to you
 sorrow has filled your hearts. ","Nevertheless
 I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away
 for if I do not go away
 the Advocate will not come to you; but if I go
 I will send him to you. ","And when he comes
 he will prove the world wrong about sin and righteousness and judgement: ","about sin
 because they do not believe in me; ","about righteousness
 because I am going to the Father and you will see me no longer; ","about judgement
 because the ruler of this world has been condemned.","\u2018I still have many things to say to you
 but you cannot bear them now. ","When the Spirit of truth comes
 he will guide you into all the truth; for he will not speak on his own
 but will speak whatever he hears
 and he will declare to you the things that are to come. ","He will glorify me
 because he will take what is mine and declare it to you. ","All that the Father has is mine. For this reason I said that he will take what is mine and declare it to you.","\u2018A little while
 and you will no longer see me
 and again a little while
 and you will see me.\u2019 ","Then some of his disciples said to one another
 \u2018What does he mean by saying to us
 \u201cA little while
 and you will no longer see me
 and again a little while
 and you will see me\u201d; and \u201cBecause I am going to the Father\u201d?\u2019 ","They said
 \u2018What does he mean by this \u201ca little while\u201d? We do not know what he is talking about.\u2019 ","Jesus knew that they wanted to ask him
 so he said to them
 \u2018Are you discussing among yourselves what I meant when I said
 \u201cA little while
 and you will no longer see me
 and again a little while
 and you will see me\u201d? ","Very truly
 I tell you
 you will weep and mourn
 but the world will rejoice; you will have pain
 but your pain will turn into joy. ","When a woman is in labour
 she has pain
 because her hour has come. But when her child is born
 she no longer remembers the anguish because of the joy of having brought a human being into the world. ","So you have pain now; but I will see you again
 and your hearts will rejoice
 and no one will take your joy from you. ","On that day you will ask nothing of me. Very truly
 I tell you
 if you ask anything of the Father in my name
 he will give it to you. ","Until now you have not asked for anything in my name. Ask and you will receive
 so that your joy may be complete.","\u2018I have said these things to you in figures of speech. The hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figures
 but will tell you plainly of the Father. ","On that day you will ask in my name. I do not say to you that I will ask the Father on your behalf;","for the Father himself loves you
 because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God. ","I came from the Father and have come into the world; again
 I am leaving the world and am going to the Father.\u2019","Jesus answered them
 \u2018Do you now believe? ","The hour is coming
 indeed it has come
 when you will be scattered
 each one to his home
 and you will leave me alone. Yet I am not alone because the Father is with me. ","I have said this to you
 so that in me you may have peace. In the world you face persecution. But take courage; I have conquered the world!\u2019","After Jesus had spoken these words
 he looked up to heaven and said
 \u2018Father
 the hour has come; glorify your Son so that the Son may glorify you
 ","since you have given him authority over all people
 to give eternal life to all whom you have given him. ","And this is eternal life
 that they may know you
 the only true God
 and Jesus Christ whom you have sent. ","I glorified you on earth by finishing the work that you gave me to do.","So now
 Father
 glorify me in your own presence with the glory that I had in your presence before the world existed.","\u2018I have made your name known to those whom you gave me from the world. They were yours
 and you gave them to me

 and they have received them and know in truth that I came from you; and they have believed that you sent me. ","I am asking on their behalf; I am not asking on behalf of the world
 but on behalf of those whom you gave me
 because they are yours. ","All mine are yours
 and yours are mine; and I have been glorified in them. ","And now I am no longer in the world
 but they are in the world
 and I am coming to you. Holy Father
 protect them in your name that you have given me
 so that they may be one
 as we are one. ","While I was with them
 I protected them in your name that you have given me. I guarded them
 and not one of them was lost except the one destined to be lost
 so that the scripture might be fulfilled. ","But now I am coming to you
 and I speak these things in the world so that they may have my joy made complete in themselves. ","I have given them your word
 and the world has hated them because they do not belong to the world
 just as I do not belong to the world. ","I am not asking you to take them out of the world
 but I ask you to protect them from the evil one. ","They do not belong to the world
 just as I do not belong to the world. ","Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth.","As you have sent me into the world
 so I have sent them into the world. ","And for their sakes I sanctify myself
 so that they also may be sanctified in truth.","\u2018I ask not only on behalf of these
 but also on behalf of those who will believe in me through their word
 ","that they may all be one. As you
 Father
 are in me and I am in you
 may they also be in us
 so that the world may believe that you have sent me. ","The glory that you have given me I have given them
 so that they may be one
 as we are one
 ","I in them and you in me

 so that the world may know that you have sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me. ","Father
 I desire that those also
 whom you have given me
 may be with me where I am
 to see my glory
 which you have given me because you loved me before the foundation of the world.","\u2018Righteous Father
 the world does not know you
 but I know you; and these know that you have sent me. ","I made your name known to them
 and I will make it known
 so that the love with which you have loved me may be in them

 knowing all that was to happen to him
 came forward and asked them
 \u2018For whom are you looking?\u2019 ","They answered
 \u2018Jesus of Nazareth.\u2019 Jesus replied
 \u2018I am he.\u2019 Judas
 who betrayed him
 was standing with them. ","When Jesus said to them
 \u2018I am he\u2019
 they stepped back and fell to the ground. ","Again he asked them
 \u2018For whom are you looking?\u2019 And they said
 \u2018Jesus of Nazareth.\u2019 ","Jesus answered
 \u2018I told you that I am he. So if you are looking for me
 let these men go.\u2019 ","Jesus said to Peter
 \u2018Put your sword back into its sheath. Am I not to drink the cup that the Father has given me?\u2019","The woman said to Peter
 \u2018You are not also one of this man\u2019s disciples
 are you?\u2019 He said
 \u2018I am not.\u2019 ","Jesus answered
 \u2018I have spoken openly to the world; I have always taught in synagogues and in the temple
 where all the Jews come together. I have said nothing in secret. ","Why do you ask me? Ask those who heard what I said to them; they know what I said.\u2019","Jesus answered
 \u2018If I have spoken wrongly
 testify to the wrong. But if I have spoken rightly
 why do you strike me?\u2019 ","Pilate said to them
 \u2018Take him yourselves and judge him according to your law.\u2019 The Jews replied
 \u2018We are not permitted to put anyone to death.\u2019 ","Jesus answered
 \u2018Do you ask this on your own
 or did others tell you about me?\u2019 ","Jesus answered
 \u2018My kingdom is not from this world. If my kingdom were from this world
 my followers would be fighting to keep me from being handed over to the Jews. But as it is
 my kingdom is not from here.\u2019 ","Pilate asked him
 \u2018So you are a king?\u2019 Jesus answered
 \u2018You say that I am a king. For this I was born
 and for this I came into the world
 to testify to the truth. Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice.\u2019 ","Pilate went out again and said to them
 \u2018Look
 I am bringing him out to you to let you know that I find no case against him.\u2019 ","So Jesus came out
 wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them
 \u2018Here is the man!\u2019 ","When the chief priests and the police saw him
 they shouted
 \u2018Crucify him! Crucify him!\u2019 Pilate said to them
 \u2018Take him yourselves and crucify him; I find no case against him.\u2019 ","Jesus answered him
 \u2018You would have no power over me unless it had been given you from above; therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin.\u2019 ","Now it was the day of Preparation for the Passover; and it was about noon. He said to the Jews
 \u2018Here is your King!\u2019 ","When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing beside her
 he said to his mother
 \u2018Woman
 here is your son.\u2019 ","Then he said to the disciple
 \u2018Here is your mother.\u2019 And from that hour the disciple took her into his own home.","After this
 when Jesus knew that all was now finished
 he said (in order to fulfil the scripture)
 \u2018I am thirsty.\u2019 ","When Jesus had received the wine

 \u2018It is finished.\u2019 Then he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.","So she ran and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple

 \u2018Woman
 why are you weeping?\u2019 She said to them
 \u2018They have taken away my Lord

 \u2018Woman
 why are you weeping? For whom are you looking?\u2019 Supposing him to be the gardener
 she said to him
 \u2018Sir

 \u2018Mary!\u2019 She turned and said to him in Hebrew
 \u2018Rabbouni!\u2019 (which means Teacher). ","Jesus said to her
 \u2018Do not hold on to me

 the first day of the week
 and the doors of the house where the disciples had met were locked for fear of the Jews
 Jesus came and stood among them and said
 \u2018Peace be with you.\u2019 ","Jesus said to them again
 \u2018Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me
 so I send you.\u2019 ","When he had said this
 he breathed on them and said to them
 \u2018Receive the Holy Spirit. ","If you forgive the sins of any
 they are forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any
 they are retained.\u2019","So the other disciples told him
 \u2018We have seen the Lord.\u2019 But he said to them
 \u2018Unless I see the mark of the nails in his hands
 and put my finger in the mark of the nails and my hand in his side
 I will not believe.\u2019","A week later his disciples were again in the house
 and Thomas was with them. Although the doors were shut
 Jesus came and stood among them and said
 \u2018Peace be with you.\u2019 ","Then he said to Thomas
 \u2018Put your finger here and see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it in my side. Do not doubt but believe.\u2019 ","Jesus said to him
 \u2018Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have come to believe.\u2019","Jesus said to them
 \u2018Children
 you have no fish
 have you?\u2019 They answered him
 \u2018No.\u2019 ","Jesus said to them
 \u2018Bring some of the fish that you have just caught.\u2019 ","Jesus said to them
 \u2018Come and have breakfast.\u2019 Now none of the disciples dared to ask him
 \u2018Who are you?\u2019 because they knew it was the Lord. ","When they had finished breakfast
 Jesus said to Simon Peter
 \u2018Simon son of John
 do you love me more than these?\u2019 He said to him
 \u2018Yes
 Lord; you know that I love you.\u2019 Jesus said to him
 \u2018Feed my lambs.\u2019 ","A second time he said to him
 \u2018Simon son of John
 do you love me?\u2019 He said to him
 \u2018Yes
 Lord; you know that I love you.\u2019 Jesus said to him
 \u2018Tend my sheep.\u2019 ","He said to him the third time
 \u2018Simon son of John
 do you love me?\u2019 Peter felt hurt because he said to him the third time
 \u2018Do you love me?\u2019 And he said to him
 \u2018Lord
 you know everything; you know that I love you.\u2019 Jesus said to him
 \u2018Feed my sheep. ","Very truly
 I tell you
 when you were younger
 you used to fasten your own belt and to go wherever you wished. But when you grow old
 you will stretch out your hands
 and someone else will fasten a belt around you and take you where you do not wish to go.\u2019 ","(He said this to indicate the kind of death by which he would glorify God.) After this he said to him
 \u2018Follow me.\u2019","Jesus said to him
 \u2018If it is my will that he remain until I come
 what is that to you? Follow me!\u2019 ","So the rumour spread in the community that this disciple would not die. Yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die
 but
 \u2018If it is my will that he remain until I come
 what is that to you?\u2019","And they asked him
 \u201cWhat then? Are you Elijah?\u201d He said
 \u201cI am not.\u201d \u201cAre you the prophet?\u201d He answered
 \u201cNo.\u201d ","Then they said to him
 \u201cWho are you? Let us have an answer for those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?\u201d ","He said
 \u201cI am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness
 \u2018Make straight the way of the Lord
\u2019\u201d as the prophet Isaiah said.","When Jesus turned and saw them following
 he said to them
 \u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d They said to him
 \u201cRabbi\u201d (which translated means Teacher)
 \u201cwhere are you staying?\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cCome and see.\u201d They came and saw where he was staying
 and they remained with him that day. It was about four o\u2019clock in the afternoon. ","He brought Simon to Jesus
 who looked at him and said
 \u201cYou are Simon son of John. You are to be called Cephas\u201d (which is translated Peter).","The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee. He found Philip and said to him
 \u201cFollow me.\u201d ","Philip found Nathanael and said to him
 \u201cWe have found him about whom Moses in the law and also the prophets wrote
 Jesus son of Joseph from Nazareth.\u201d ","Nathanael said to him
 \u201cCan anything good come out of Nazareth?\u201d Philip said to him
 \u201cCome and see.\u201d ","When Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him
 he said of him
 \u201cHere is truly an Israelite in whom there is no deceit!\u201d ","Nathanael asked him
 \u201cWhere did you get to know me?\u201d Jesus answered
 \u201cI saw you under the fig tree before Philip called you.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cDo you believe because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree? You will see greater things than these.\u201d ","And he said to him
 \u201cVery truly
 I tell you
 you will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.\u201d","And Jesus said to her
 \u201cWoman
 what concern is that to you and to me? My hour has not yet come.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cFill the jars with water.\u201d And they filled them up to the brim. ","He said to them
 \u201cNow draw some out
 and take it to the chief steward.\u201d So they took it. ","He told those who were selling the doves
 \u201cTake these things out of here! Stop making my Father\u2019s house a marketplace!\u201d ","Jesus answered them
 \u201cDestroy this temple
 and in three days I will raise it up.\u201d ","Jesus answered him
 \u201cVery truly
 I tell you
 no one can see the kingdom of God without being born from above.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cVery truly
 I tell you
 no one can enter the kingdom of God without being born of water and Spirit. ","What is born of the flesh is flesh
 and what is born of the Spirit is spirit. ","Do not be astonished that I said to you
 \u2018You must be born from above.\u2019 ","The wind blows where it chooses
 and you hear the sound of it
 but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.\u201d ","Jesus answered him
 \u201cAre you a teacher of Israel
 and yet you do not understand these things?","\u201cVery truly
 I tell you
 we speak of what we know and testify to what we have seen; yet you do not receive our testimony. ","If I have told you about earthly things and you do not believe
 how can you believe if I tell you about heavenly things? ","No one has ascended into heaven except the one who descended from heaven
 the Son of Man. ","And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness
 so must the Son of Man be lifted up
 ","that whoever believes in him may have eternal life.","\u201cFor God so loved the world that he gave his only Son
 so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life.","\u201cIndeed
 God did not send the Son into the world to condemn the world
 but in order that the world might be saved through him. ","Those who believe in him are not condemned; but those who do not believe are condemned already
 because they have not believed in the name of the only Son of God. ","And this is the judgment
 that the light has come into the world
 and people loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil. ","For all who do evil hate the light and do not come to the light
 so that their deeds may not be exposed. ","But those who do what is true come to the light
 so that it may be clearly seen that their deeds have been done in God.\u201d","They came to John and said to him
 \u201cRabbi
 the one who was with you across the Jordan
 to whom you testified
 here he is baptizing
 and all are going to him.\u201d ","A Samaritan woman came to draw water
 and Jesus said to her
 \u201cGive me a drink.\u201d ","Jesus answered her
 \u201cIf you knew the gift of God
 and who it is that is saying to you
 \u2018Give me a drink
\u2019 you would have asked him
 and he would have given you living water.\u201d ","Jesus said to her
 \u201cEveryone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again
 ","but those who drink of the water that I will give them will never be thirsty. The water that I will give will become in them a spring of water gushing up to eternal life.\u201d","The woman said to him
 \u201cSir
 give me this water
 so that I may never be thirsty or have to keep coming here to draw water.\u201d","Jesus said to her
 \u201cGo
 call your husband
 and come back.\u201d ","The woman answered him
 \u201cI have no husband.\u201d Jesus said to her
 \u201cYou are right in saying
 \u2018I have no husband\u2019; ","for you have had five husbands
 and the one you have now is not your husband. What you have said is true!\u201d ","Jesus said to her
 \u201cWoman
 believe me
 the hour is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem. ","You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know
 for salvation is from the Jews. ","But the hour is coming
 and is now here
 when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth
 for the Father seeks such as these to worship him. ","God is spirit
 and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.\u201d ","Jesus said to her
 \u201cI am he
 the one who is speaking to you.\u201d","But he said to them
 \u201cI have food to eat that you do not know about.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cMy food is to do the will of him who sent me and to complete his work. ","Do you not say
 \u2018Four months more
 then comes the harvest\u2019? But I tell you
 look around you
 and see how the fields are ripe for harvesting. ","The reaper is already receiving wages and is gathering fruit for eternal life
 so that sower and reaper may rejoice together. ","For here the saying holds true
 \u2018One sows and another reaps.\u2019 ","I sent you to reap that for which you did not labor. Others have labored
 and you have entered into their labor.\u201d","They said to the woman
 \u201cIt is no longer because of what you said that we believe
 for we have heard for ourselves
 and we know that this is truly the Savior of the world.\u201d","Then Jesus said to him
 \u201cUnless you see signs and wonders you will not believe.\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cGo; your son will live.\u201d The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and started on his way. ","So he asked them the hour when he began to recover
 and they said to him
 \u201cYesterday at one in the afternoon the fever left him.\u201d ","The father realized that this was the hour when Jesus had said to him
 \u201cYour son will live.\u201d So he himself believed
 along with his whole household. ","When Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had been there a long time
 he said to him
 \u201cDo you want to be made well?\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cStand up
 take your mat and walk.\u201d ","But he answered them
 \u201cThe man who made me well said to me
 \u2018Take up your mat and walk.\u2019\u201d ","Later Jesus found him in the temple and said to him
 \u201cSee
 you have been made well! Do not sin any more
 so that nothing worse happens to you.\u201d ","But Jesus answered them
 \u201cMy Father is still working
 and I also am working.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cVery truly
 I tell you
 the Son can do nothing on his own
 but only what he sees the Father doing; for whatever the Father does
 the Son does likewise. ","The Father loves the Son and shows him all that he himself is doing; and he will show him greater works than these
 so that you will be astonished. ","Indeed
 just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life
 so also the Son gives life to whomever he wishes. ","The Father judges no one but has given all judgment to the Son
 ","so that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. Anyone who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.","Very truly
 I tell you
 anyone who hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life
 and does not come under judgment
 but has passed from death to life.","\u201cVery truly
 I tell you
 the hour is coming
 and is now here
 when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God
 and those who hear will live. ","For just as the Father has life in himself
 so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself; ","and he has given him authority to execute judgment
 because he is the Son of Man. ","Do not be astonished at this; for the hour is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice","and will come out\u2014those who have done good
 to the resurrection of life
 and those who have done evil
 to the resurrection of condemnation.","\u201cI can do nothing on my own. As I hear
 I judge; and my judgment is just
 because I seek to do not my own will but the will of him who sent me.","\u201cIf I testify about myself
 my testimony is not true. ","There is another who testifies on my behalf
 and I know that his testimony to me is true. ","You sent messengers to John
 and he testified to the truth. ","Not that I accept such human testimony
 but I say these things so that you may be saved. ","He was a burning and shining lamp
 and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light. ","But I have a testimony greater than John\u2019s. The works that the Father has given me to complete
 the very works that I am doing
 testify on my behalf that the Father has sent me. ","And the Father who sent me has himself testified on my behalf. You have never heard his voice or seen his form
 ","and you do not have his word abiding in you
 because you do not believe him whom he has sent.","\u201cYou search the scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is they that testify on my behalf.","Yet you refuse to come to me to have life.","I do not accept glory from human beings.","But I know that you do not have the love of God in you.","I have come in my Father\u2019s name
 and you do not accept me; if another comes in his own name
 you will accept him. ","How can you believe when you accept glory from one another and do not seek the glory that comes from the one who alone is God?","Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father; your accuser is Moses
 on whom you have set your hope. ","If you believed Moses
 you would believe me
 for he wrote about me. ","But if you do not believe what he wrote
 how will you believe what I say?\u201d","When he looked up and saw a large crowd coming toward him
 Jesus said to Philip
 \u201cWhere are we to buy bread for these people to eat?\u201d ","Jesus said
 \u201cMake the people sit down.\u201d Now there was a great deal of grass in the place; so they sat down
 about five thousand in all. ","When they were satisfied
 he told his disciples
 \u201cGather up the fragments left over
 so that nothing may be lost.\u201d ","But he said to them
 \u201cIt is I; do not be afraid.\u201d ","Jesus answered them
 \u201cVery truly
 I tell you
 you are looking for me
 not because you saw signs
 but because you ate your fill of the loaves. ","Do not work for the food that perishes
 but for the food that endures for eternal life
 which the Son of Man will give you. For it is on him that God the Father has set his seal.\u201d ","Jesus answered them
 \u201cThis is the work of God
 that you believe in him whom he has sent.\u201d ","Then Jesus said to them
 \u201cVery truly
 I tell you
 it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven
 but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven. ","For the bread of God is that which comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cI am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never be hungry
 and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty. ","But I said to you that you have seen me and yet do not believe.","Everything that the Father gives me will come to me
 and anyone who comes to me I will never drive away; ","for I have come down from heaven
 not to do my own will
 but the will of him who sent me. ","And this is the will of him who sent me
 that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me
 but raise it up on the last day. ","This is indeed the will of my Father
 that all who see the Son and believe in him may have eternal life; and I will raise them up on the last day.\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cDo not complain among yourselves. ","No one can come to me unless drawn by the Father who sent me; and I will raise that person up on the last day.","It is written in the prophets
 \u2018And they shall all be taught by God.\u2019 Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me. ","Not that anyone has seen the Father except the one who is from God; he has seen the Father.","Very truly
 I tell you
 whoever believes has eternal life. ","I am the bread of life.","Your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness
 and they died. ","This is the bread that comes down from heaven
 so that one may eat of it and not die. ","I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Whoever eats of this bread will live forever; and the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.\u201d","So Jesus said to them
 \u201cVery truly
 I tell you
 unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood
 you have no life in you. ","Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood have eternal life
 and I will raise them up on the last day; ","for my flesh is true food and my blood is true drink.","Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood abide in me
 and I in them. ","Just as the living Father sent me
 and I live because of the Father
 so whoever eats me will live because of me. ","This is the bread that came down from heaven
 not like that which your ancestors ate
 and they died. But the one who eats this bread will live forever.\u201d ","But Jesus
 being aware that his disciples were complaining about it
 said to them
 \u201cDoes this offend you? ","Then what if you were to see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before?","It is the spirit that gives life; the flesh is useless. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life.","But among you there are some who do not believe.\u201d For Jesus knew from the first who were the ones that did not believe
 and who was the one that would betray him. ","And he said
 \u201cFor this reason I have told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted by the Father.\u201d","So Jesus asked the twelve
 \u201cDo you also wish to go away?\u201d ","Jesus answered them
 \u201cDid I not choose you
 the twelve? Yet one of you is a devil.\u201d ","So his brothers said to him
 \u201cLeave here and go to Judea so that your disciples also may see the works you are doing; ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cMy time has not yet come
 but your time is always here. ","The world cannot hate you
 but it hates me because I testify against it that its works are evil. ","Go to the festival yourselves. I am not going to this festival
 for my time has not yet fully come.\u201d ","Then Jesus answered them
 \u201cMy teaching is not mine but his who sent me. ","Anyone who resolves to do the will of God will know whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own.","Those who speak on their own seek their own glory; but the one who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true
 and there is nothing false in him.","\u201cDid not Moses give you the law? Yet none of you keeps the law. Why are you looking for an opportunity to kill me?\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cI performed one work
 and all of you are astonished. ","Moses gave you circumcision (it is
 of course
 not from Moses
 but from the patriarchs)
 and you circumcise a man on the sabbath. ","If a man receives circumcision on the sabbath in order that the law of Moses may not be broken
 are you angry with me because I healed a man\u2019s whole body on the sabbath? ","Do not judge by appearances
 but judge with right judgment.\u201d","Now some of the people of Jerusalem were saying
 \u201cIs not this the man whom they are trying to kill? ","Then Jesus cried out as he was teaching in the temple
 \u201cYou know me
 and you know where I am from. I have not come on my own. But the one who sent me is true
 and you do not know him. ","I know him
 because I am from him
 and he sent me.\u201d ","Jesus then said
 \u201cI will be with you a little while longer
 and then I am going to him who sent me. ","You will search for me
 but you will not find me; and where I am
 you cannot come.\u201d ","The Jews said to one another
 \u201cWhere does this man intend to go that we will not find him? Does he intend to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks? ","On the last day of the festival
 the great day
 while Jesus was standing there
 he cried out
 \u201cLet anyone who is thirsty come to me
 ","and let the one who believes in me drink. As the scripture has said
 \u2018Out of the believer\u2019s heart shall flow rivers of living water.\u2019\u201d ","Now he said this about the Spirit
 which believers in him were to receive; for as yet there was no Spirit
 because Jesus was not yet glorified.","they said to him
 \u201cTeacher
 this woman was caught in the very act of committing adultery. ","When they kept on questioning him
 he straightened up and said to them
 \u201cLet anyone among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.\u201d ","Jesus straightened up and said to her
 \u201cWoman
 where are they? Has no one condemned you?\u201d ","She said
 \u201cNo one
 sir.\u201d And Jesus said
 \u201cNeither do I condemn you. Go your way
 and from now on do not sin again.\u201d]]","Again Jesus spoke to them
 saying
 \u201cI am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness but will have the light of life.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cEven if I testify on my own behalf
 my testimony is valid because I know where I have come from and where I am going
 but you do not know where I come from or where I am going. ","You judge by human standards; I judge no one.","Yet even if I do judge
 my judgment is valid; for it is not I alone who judge
 but I and the Father who sent me. ","In your law it is written that the testimony of two witnesses is valid.","I testify on my own behalf
 and the Father who sent me testifies on my behalf.\u201d ","Then they said to him
 \u201cWhere is your Father?\u201d Jesus answered
 \u201cYou know neither me nor my Father. If you knew me
 you would know my Father also.\u201d ","Again he said to them
 \u201cI am going away
 and you will search for me
 but you will die in your sin. Where I am going
 you cannot come.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cYou are from below
 I am from above; you are of this world
 I am not of this world. ","I told you that you would die in your sins
 for you will die in your sins unless you believe that I am he.\u201d ","They said to him
 \u201cWho are you?\u201d Jesus said to them
 \u201cWhy do I speak to you at all? ","I have much to say about you and much to condemn; but the one who sent me is true
 and I declare to the world what I have heard from him.\u201d ","So Jesus said
 \u201cWhen you have lifted up the Son of Man
 then you will realize that I am he
 and that I do nothing on my own
 but I speak these things as the Father instructed me. ","And the one who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone
 for I always do what is pleasing to him.\u201d ","Then Jesus said to the Jews who had believed in him
 \u201cIf you continue in my word
 you are truly my disciples; ","and you will know the truth
 and the truth will make you free.\u201d ","Jesus answered them
 \u201cVery truly
 I tell you
 everyone who commits sin is a slave to sin. ","The slave does not have a permanent place in the household; the son has a place there forever.","So if the Son makes you free
 you will be free indeed. ","I know that you are descendants of Abraham; yet you look for an opportunity to kill me
 because there is no place in you for my word. ","I declare what I have seen in the Father\u2019s presence; as for you
 you should do what you have heard from the Father.\u201d","They answered him
 \u201cAbraham is our father.\u201d Jesus said to them
 \u201cIf you were Abraham\u2019s children
 you would be doing what Abraham did
 ","but now you are trying to kill me
 a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. This is not what Abraham did. ","You are indeed doing what your father does.\u201d They said to him
 \u201cWe are not illegitimate children; we have one father
 God himself.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cIf God were your Father
 you would love me
 for I came from God and now I am here. I did not come on my own
 but he sent me. ","Why do you not understand what I say? It is because you cannot accept my word.","You are from your father the devil
 and you choose to do your father\u2019s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth
 because there is no truth in him. When he lies
 he speaks according to his own nature
 for he is a liar and the father of lies. ","But because I tell the truth
 you do not believe me. ","Which of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth
 why do you not believe me? ","Whoever is from God hears the words of God. The reason you do not hear them is that you are not from God.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cI do not have a demon; but I honor my Father
 and you dishonor me. ","Yet I do not seek my own glory; there is one who seeks it and he is the judge.","Very truly
 I tell you
 whoever keeps my word will never see death.\u201d ","The Jews said to him
 \u201cNow we know that you have a demon. Abraham died
 and so did the prophets; yet you say
 \u2018Whoever keeps my word will never taste death.\u2019 ","Jesus answered
 \u201cIf I glorify myself
 my glory is nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me
 he of whom you say
 \u2018He is our God
\u2019 ","though you do not know him. But I know him; if I would say that I do not know him
 I would be a liar like you. But I do know him and I keep his word. ","Your ancestor Abraham rejoiced that he would see my day; he saw it and was glad.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cVery truly
 I tell you
 before Abraham was
 I am.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cNeither this man nor his parents sinned; he was born blind so that God\u2019s works might be revealed in him. ","We must work the works of him who sent me while it is day; night is coming when no one can work.","As long as I am in the world
 I am the light of the world.\u201d ","saying to him
 \u201cGo
 wash in the pool of Siloam\u201d (which means Sent). Then he went and washed and came back able to see. ","He answered
 \u201cThe man called Jesus made mud
 spread it on my eyes
 and said to me
 \u2018Go to Siloam and wash.\u2019 Then I went and washed and received my sight.\u201d ","They said to him
 \u201cWhere is he?\u201d He said
 \u201cI do not know.\u201d","So for the second time they called the man who had been blind
 and they said to him
 \u201cGive glory to God! We know that this man is a sinner.\u201d ","He answered
 \u201cI do not know whether he is a sinner. One thing I do know
 that though I was blind
 now I see.\u201d ","They said to him
 \u201cWhat did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?\u201d ","He answered them
 \u201cI have told you already
 and you would not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also want to become his disciples?\u201d ","Jesus heard that they had driven him out
 and when he found him
 he said
 \u201cDo you believe in the Son of Man?\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cYou have seen him
 and the one speaking with you is he.\u201d ","Jesus said
 \u201cI came into this world for judgment so that those who do not see may see
 and those who do see may become blind.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cIf you were blind
 you would not have sin. But now that you say
 \u2018We see
\u2019 your sin remains.","\u201cVery truly
 I tell you
 anyone who does not enter the sheepfold by the gate but climbs in by another way is a thief and a bandit. ","The one who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep.","The gatekeeper opens the gate for him
 and the sheep hear his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. ","When he has brought out all his own
 he goes ahead of them
 and the sheep follow him because they know his voice. ","They will not follow a stranger
 but they will run from him because they do not know the voice of strangers.\u201d ","So again Jesus said to them
 \u201cVery truly
 I tell you
 I am the gate for the sheep. ","All who came before me are thieves and bandits; but the sheep did not listen to them.","I am the gate. Whoever enters by me will be saved
 and will come in and go out and find pasture. ","The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life
 and have it abundantly.","\u201cI am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.","The hired hand
 who is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep
 sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and runs away\u2014and the wolf snatches them and scatters them. ","The hired hand runs away because a hired hand does not care for the sheep.","I am the good shepherd. I know my own and my own know me
 ","just as the Father knows me and I know the Father. And I lay down my life for the sheep.","I have other sheep that do not belong to this fold. I must bring them also
 and they will listen to my voice. So there will be one flock
 one shepherd. ","For this reason the Father loves me
 because I lay down my life in order to take it up again. ","No one takes it from me
 but I lay it down of my own accord. I have power to lay it down
 and I have power to take it up again. I have received this command from my Father.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cI have told you
 and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father\u2019s name testify to me; ","but you do not believe
 because you do not belong to my sheep. ","My sheep hear my voice. I know them
 and they follow me. ","I give them eternal life
 and they will never perish. No one will snatch them out of my hand. ","What my Father has given me is greater than all else
 and no one can snatch it out of the Father\u2019s hand. ","The Father and I are one.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cI have shown you many good works from the Father. For which of these are you going to stone me?\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cIs it not written in your law
 \u2018I said
 you are gods\u2019? ","If those to whom the word of God came were called \u2018gods\u2019\u2014and the scripture cannot be annulled\u2014","can you say that the one whom the Father has sanctified and sent into the world is blaspheming because I said
 \u2018I am God\u2019s Son\u2019? ","If I am not doing the works of my Father
 then do not believe me. ","But if I do them
 even though you do not believe me
 believe the works
 so that you may know and understand that the Father is in me and I am in the Father.\u201d ","But when Jesus heard it
 he said
 \u201cThis illness does not lead to death; rather it is for God\u2019s glory
 so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.\u201d ","Then after this he said to the disciples
 \u201cLet us go to Judea again.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cAre there not twelve hours of daylight? Those who walk during the day do not stumble
 because they see the light of this world. ","But those who walk at night stumble
 because the light is not in them.\u201d ","After saying this
 he told them
 \u201cOur friend Lazarus has fallen asleep
 but I am going there to awaken him.\u201d ","Then Jesus told them plainly
 \u201cLazarus is dead. ","For your sake I am glad I was not there
 so that you may believe. But let us go to him.\u201d ","Thomas
 who was called the Twin
 said to his fellow disciples
 \u201cLet us also go
 that we may die with him.\u201d","Jesus said to her
 \u201cYour brother will rise again.\u201d ","Jesus said to her
 \u201cI am the resurrection and the life. Those who believe in me
 even though they die
 will live
 ","and everyone who lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?\u201d","She said to him
 \u201cYes
 Lord
 I believe that you are the Messiah
 the Son of God
 the one coming into the world.\u201d","When Mary came where Jesus was and saw him
 she knelt at his feet and said to him
 \u201cLord
 if you had been here
 my brother would not have died.\u201d ","He said
 \u201cWhere have you laid him?\u201d They said to him
 \u201cLord
 come and see.\u201d ","Jesus said
 \u201cTake away the stone.\u201d Martha
 the sister of the dead man
 said to him
 \u201cLord
 already there is a stench because he has been dead four days.\u201d ","Jesus said to her
 \u201cDid I not tell you that if you believed
 you would see the glory of God?\u201d ","So they took away the stone. And Jesus looked upward and said
 \u201cFather
 I thank you for having heard me. ","I knew that you always hear me
 but I have said this for the sake of the crowd standing here
 so that they may believe that you sent me.\u201d ","When he had said this
 he cried with a loud voice
 \u201cLazarus
 come out!\u201d ","The dead man came out
 his hands and feet bound with strips of cloth
 and his face wrapped in a cloth. Jesus said to them
 \u201cUnbind him
 and let him go.\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cLeave her alone. She bought it so that she might keep it for the day of my burial. ","You always have the poor with you
 but you do not always have me.\u201d","So the crowd that had been with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to testify.","The Pharisees then said to one another
 \u201cYou see
 you can do nothing. Look
 the world has gone after him!\u201d","They came to Philip
 who was from Bethsaida in Galilee
 and said to him
 \u201cSir
 we wish to see Jesus.\u201d ","Jesus answered them
 \u201cThe hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. ","Very truly
 I tell you
 unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies
 it remains just a single grain; but if it dies
 it bears much fruit. ","Those who love their life lose it
 and those who hate their life in this world will keep it for eternal life. ","Whoever serves me must follow me
 and where I am
 there will my servant be also. Whoever serves me
 the Father will honor.","\u201cNow my soul is troubled. And what should I say\u2014\u2018Father
 save me from this hour\u2019? No
 it is for this reason that I have come to this hour. ","Father
 glorify your name.\u201d Then a voice came from heaven
 \u201cI have glorified it
 and I will glorify it again.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cThis voice has come for your sake
 not for mine. ","Now is the judgment of this world; now the ruler of this world will be driven out.","And I
 when I am lifted up from the earth
 will draw all people to myself.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cThe light is with you for a little longer. Walk while you have the light
 so that the darkness may not overtake you. If you walk in the darkness
 you do not know where you are going. ","While you have the light
 believe in the light
 so that you may become children of light.\u201d After Jesus had said this
 he departed and hid from them. ","Then Jesus cried aloud: \u201cWhoever believes in me believes not in me but in him who sent me.","And whoever sees me sees him who sent me.","I have come as light into the world
 so that everyone who believes in me should not remain in the darkness. ","I do not judge anyone who hears my words and does not keep them
 for I came not to judge the world
 but to save the world. ","The one who rejects me and does not receive my word has a judge; on the last day the word that I have spoken will serve as judge
 ","for I have not spoken on my own
 but the Father who sent me has himself given me a commandment about what to say and what to speak. ","And I know that his commandment is eternal life. What I speak
 therefore
 I speak just as the Father has told me.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cYou do not know now what I am doing
 but later you will understand.\u201d ","Peter said to him
 \u201cYou will never wash my feet.\u201d Jesus answered
 \u201cUnless I wash you
 you have no share with me.\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cOne who has bathed does not need to wash
 except for the feet
 but is entirely clean. And you are clean
 though not all of you.\u201d ","For he knew who was to betray him; for this reason he said
 \u201cNot all of you are clean.\u201d","After he had washed their feet
 had put on his robe
 and had returned to the table
 he said to them
 \u201cDo you know what I have done to you? ","You call me Teacher and Lord\u2014and you are right
 for that is what I am. ","So if I
 your Lord and Teacher
 have washed your feet
 you also ought to wash one another\u2019s feet. ","For I have set you an example
 that you also should do as I have done to you. ","Very truly
 I tell you
 servants are not greater than their master
 nor are messengers greater than the one who sent them. ","If you know these things
 you are blessed if you do them. ","I am not speaking of all of you; I know whom I have chosen. But it is to fulfill the scripture
 \u2018The one who ate my bread has lifted his heel against me.\u2019 ","I tell you this now
 before it occurs
 so that when it does occur
 you may believe that I am he. ","Very truly
 I tell you
 whoever receives one whom I send receives me; and whoever receives me receives him who sent me.\u201d","After saying this Jesus was troubled in spirit
 and declared
 \u201cVery truly
 I tell you
 one of you will betray me.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cIt is the one to whom I give this piece of bread when I have dipped it in the dish.\u201d So when he had dipped the piece of bread
 he gave it to Judas son of Simon Iscariot. ","After he received the piece of bread
 Satan entered into him. Jesus said to him
 \u201cDo quickly what you are going to do.\u201d ","When he had gone out
 Jesus said
 \u201cNow the Son of Man has been glorified
 and God has been glorified in him. ","If God has been glorified in him
 God will also glorify him in himself and will glorify him at once. ","Little children
 I am with you only a little longer. You will look for me; and as I said to the Jews so now I say to you
 \u2018Where I am going
 you cannot come.\u2019 ","I give you a new commandment
 that you love one another. Just as I have loved you
 you also should love one another. ","By this everyone will know that you are my disciples
 if you have love for one another.\u201d","Simon Peter said to him
 \u201cLord
 where are you going?\u201d Jesus answered
 \u201cWhere I am going
 you cannot follow me now; but you will follow afterward.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cWill you lay down your life for me? Very truly
 I tell you
 before the cock crows
 you will have denied me three times.","\u201cDo not let your hearts be troubled. Believe in God
 believe also in me. ","In my Father\u2019s house there are many dwelling places. If it were not so
 would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you? ","And if I go and prepare a place for you
 I will come again and will take you to myself
 so that where I am
 there you may be also. ","And you know the way to the place where I am going.\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cI am the way

 and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. ","If you know me
 you will know my Father also. From now on you do know him and have seen him.\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cHave I been with you all this time
 Philip

 \u2018Show us the Father\u2019? ","Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own; but the Father who dwells in me does his works.","Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; but if you do not
 then believe me because of the works themselves. ","Very truly
 I tell you
 the one who believes in me will also do the works that I do and
 in fact
 will do greater works than these
 because I am going to the Father. ","I will do whatever you ask in my name
 so that the Father may be glorified in the Son. ","If in my name you ask me for anything
 I will do it.","\u201cIf you love me
 you will keep my commandments. ","And I will ask the Father
 and he will give you another Advocate
 to be with you forever. ","This is the Spirit of truth
 whom the world cannot receive
 because it neither sees him nor knows him. You know him
 because he abides with you
 and he will be in you.","\u201cI will not leave you orphaned; I am coming to you.","In a little while the world will no longer see me
 but you will see me; because I live
 you also will live. ","On that day you will know that I am in my Father
 and you in me
 and I in you. ","They who have my commandments and keep them are those who love me; and those who love me will be loved by my Father
 and I will love them and reveal myself to them.\u201d ","Judas (not Iscariot) said to him
 \u201cLord
 how is it that you will reveal yourself to us
 and not to the world?\u201d ","Jesus answered him
 \u201cThose who love me will keep my word
 and my Father will love them
 and we will come to them and make our home with them. ","Whoever does not love me does not keep my words; and the word that you hear is not mine
 but is from the Father who sent me.","\u201cI have said these things to you while I am still with you.","But the Advocate
 the Holy Spirit
 whom the Father will send in my name
 will teach you everything
 and remind you of all that I have said to you. ","Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled
 and do not let them be afraid. ","You heard me say to you
 \u2018I am going away
 and I am coming to you.\u2019 If you loved me
 you would rejoice that I am going to the Father

 so that when it does occur
 you may believe. ","I will no longer talk much with you
 for the ruler of this world is coming. He has no power over me; ","but I do as the Father has commanded me
 so that the world may know that I love the Father. Rise
 let us be on our way.","\u201cI am the true vine
 and my Father is the vinegrower. ","He removes every branch in me that bears no fruit. Every branch that bears fruit he prunes to make it bear more fruit.","You have already been cleansed by the word that I have spoken to you.","Abide in me as I abide in you. Just as the branch cannot bear fruit by itself unless it abides in the vine
 neither can you unless you abide in me. ","I am the vine
 you are the branches. Those who abide in me and I in them bear much fruit
 because apart from me you can do nothing. ","Whoever does not abide in me is thrown away like a branch and withers; such branches are gathered
 thrown into the fire
 and burned. ","If you abide in me
 and my words abide in you
 ask for whatever you wish
 and it will be done for you. ","My Father is glorified by this
 that you bear much fruit and become my disciples. ","As the Father has loved me

 that you love one another as I have loved you. ","No one has greater love than this
 to lay down one\u2019s life for one\u2019s friends. ","You are my friends if you do what I command you.","I do not call you servants any longer

 fruit that will last
 so that the Father will give you whatever you ask him in my name. ","I am giving you these commands so that you may love one another.","\u201cIf the world hates you
 be aware that it hated me before it hated you. ","If you belonged to the world
 the world would love you as its own. Because you do not belong to the world
 but I have chosen you out of the world\u2014therefore the world hates you. ","Remember the word that I said to you
 \u2018Servants are not greater than their master.\u2019 If they persecuted me
 they will persecute you; if they kept my word
 they will keep yours also. ","But they will do all these things to you on account of my name
 because they do not know him who sent me. ","If I had not come and spoken to them
 they would not have sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin. ","Whoever hates me hates my Father also.","If I had not done among them the works that no one else did
 they would not have sin. But now they have seen and hated both me and my Father. ","It was to fulfill the word that is written in their law

 whom I will send to you from the Father
 the Spirit of truth who comes from the Father
 he will testify on my behalf. ","You also are to testify because you have been with me from the beginning.","\u201cI have said these things to you to keep you from stumbling.","They will put you out of the synagogues. Indeed
 an hour is coming when those who kill you will think that by doing so they are offering worship to God.

 because I was with you. ","But now I am going to him who sent me; yet none of you asks me
 \u2018Where are you going?\u2019 ","But because I have said these things to you
 sorrow has filled your hearts. ","Nevertheless I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away
 for if I do not go away
 the Advocate will not come to you; but if I go
 I will send him to you. ","And when he comes
 he will prove the world wrong about sin and righteousness and judgment: ","about sin
 because they do not believe in me; ","about righteousness
 because I am going to the Father and you will see me no longer; ","about judgment
 because the ruler of this world has been condemned.","\u201cI still have many things to say to you
 but you cannot bear them now. ","When the Spirit of truth comes
 he will guide you into all the truth; for he will not speak on his own
 but will speak whatever he hears
 and he will declare to you the things that are to come. ","He will glorify me
 because he will take what is mine and declare it to you. ","All that the Father has is mine. For this reason I said that he will take what is mine and declare it to you.","\u201cA little while

 I tell you
 you will weep and mourn
 but the world will rejoice; you will have pain
 but your pain will turn into joy. ","When a woman is in labor
 she has pain
 because her hour has come. But when her child is born
 she no longer remembers the anguish because of the joy of having brought a human being into the world. ","So you have pain now; but I will see you again

 here is your son.\u201d ","Then he said to the disciple
 \u201cHere is your mother.\u201d And from that hour the disciple took her into his own home.","After this
 when Jesus knew that all was now finished
 he said (in order to fulfill the scripture)
 \u201cI am thirsty.\u201d ","When Jesus had received the wine
 he said
 \u201cIt is finished.\u201d Then he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.","So she ran and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple
 the one whom Jesus loved
 and said to them
 \u201cThey have taken the Lord out of the tomb
 and we do not know where they have laid him.\u201d ","They said to her
 \u201cWoman
 why are you weeping?\u201d She said to them
 \u201cThey have taken away my Lord
 and I do not know where they have laid him.\u201d ","Jesus said to her
 \u201cWoman
 why are you weeping? Whom are you looking for?\u201d Supposing him to be the gardener
 she said to him
 \u201cSir
 if you have carried him away
 tell me where you have laid him
 and I will take him away.\u201d ","Jesus said to her
 \u201cMary!\u201d She turned and said to him in Hebrew
 \u201cRabbouni!\u201d (which means Teacher). ","Jesus said to her
 \u201cDo not hold on to me
 because I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers and say to them
 \u2018I am ascending to my Father and your Father
 to my God and your God.\u2019\u201d ","When it was evening on that day
 the first day of the week
 and the doors of the house where the disciples had met were locked for fear of the Jews
 Jesus came and stood among them and said
 \u201cPeace be with you.\u201d ","Jesus said to them again
 \u201cPeace be with you. As the Father has sent me
 so I send you.\u201d ","When he had said this
 he breathed on them and said to them
 \u201cReceive the Holy Spirit. ","If you forgive the sins of any
 they are forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any
 they are retained.\u201d","So the other disciples told him
 \u201cWe have seen the Lord.\u201d But he said to them
 \u201cUnless I see the mark of the nails in his hands
 and put my finger in the mark of the nails and my hand in his side
 I will not believe.\u201d","A week later his disciples were again in the house
 and Thomas was with them. Although the doors were shut
 Jesus came and stood among them and said
 \u201cPeace be with you.\u201d ","Then he said to Thomas
 \u201cPut your finger here and see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it in my side. Do not doubt but believe.\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cHave you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have come to believe.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cChildren
 you have no fish
 have you?\u201d They answered him
 \u201cNo.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cBring some of the fish that you have just caught.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cCome and have breakfast.\u201d Now none of the disciples dared to ask him
 \u201cWho are you?\u201d because they knew it was the Lord. ","When they had finished breakfast
 Jesus said to Simon Peter
 \u201cSimon son of John
 do you love me more than these?\u201d He said to him
 \u201cYes
 Lord; you know that I love you.\u201d Jesus said to him
 \u201cFeed my lambs.\u201d ","A second time he said to him
 \u201cSimon son of John
 do you love me?\u201d He said to him
 \u201cYes
 Lord; you know that I love you.\u201d Jesus said to him
 \u201cTend my sheep.\u201d ","He said to him the third time
 \u201cSimon son of John
 do you love me?\u201d Peter felt hurt because he said to him the third time
 \u201cDo you love me?\u201d And he said to him
 \u201cLord
 you know everything; you know that I love you.\u201d Jesus said to him
 \u201cFeed my sheep. ","Very truly
 I tell you
 when you were younger
 you used to fasten your own belt and to go wherever you wished. But when you grow old
 you will stretch out your hands
 and someone else will fasten a belt around you and take you where you do not wish to go.\u201d ","(He said this to indicate the kind of death by which he would glorify God.) After this he said to him
 \u201cFollow me.\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cIf it is my will that he remain until I come
 what is that to you? Follow me!\u201d ","So the rumor spread in the community that this disciple would not die. Yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die
 but
 \u201cIf it is my will that he remain until I come
 what is that to you?\u201d","And they asked him
 \u201cWhat then? Are you Elijah?\u201d He said
 \u201cI am not.\u201d \u201cAre you the prophet?\u201d He answered
 \u201cNo.\u201d ","Then they said to him
 \u201cWho are you? Let us have an answer for those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?\u201d ","He said
 \u201cI am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness
 \u2018Make straight the way of the Lord
\u2019\u201d as the prophet Isaiah said.","When Jesus turned and saw them following
 he said to them
 \u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d They said to him
 \u201cRabbi\u201d (which translated means Teacher)
 \u201cwhere are you staying?\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cCome and see.\u201d They came and saw where he was staying
 and they remained with him that day. It was about four o\u2019clock in the afternoon. ","He brought Simon to Jesus
 who looked at him and said
 \u201cYou are Simon son of John. You are to be called Cephas\u201d (which is translated Peter).","The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee. He found Philip and said to him
 \u201cFollow me.\u201d ","Philip found Nathanael and said to him
 \u201cWe have found him about whom Moses in the law and also the prophets wrote
 Jesus son of Joseph from Nazareth.\u201d ","Nathanael said to him
 \u201cCan anything good come out of Nazareth?\u201d Philip said to him
 \u201cCome and see.\u201d ","When Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him
 he said of him
 \u201cHere is truly an Israelite in whom there is no deceit!\u201d ","Nathanael asked him
 \u201cWhere did you get to know me?\u201d Jesus answered
 \u201cI saw you under the fig tree before Philip called you.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cDo you believe because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree? You will see greater things than these.\u201d ","And he said to him
 \u201cVery truly
 I tell you
 you will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.\u201d","And Jesus said to her
 \u201cWoman
 what concern is that to you and to me? My hour has not yet come.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cFill the jars with water.\u201d And they filled them up to the brim. ","He said to them
 \u201cNow draw some out
 and take it to the chief steward.\u201d So they took it. ","He told those who were selling the doves
 \u201cTake these things out of here! Stop making my Father\u2019s house a marketplace!\u201d ","Jesus answered them
 \u201cDestroy this temple
 and in three days I will raise it up.\u201d ","Jesus answered him
 \u201cVery truly
 I tell you
 no one can see the kingdom of God without being born from above.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cVery truly
 I tell you
 no one can enter the kingdom of God without being born of water and Spirit. ","What is born of the flesh is flesh
 and what is born of the Spirit is spirit. ","Do not be astonished that I said to you
 \u2018You must be born from above.\u2019 ","The wind blows where it chooses
 and you hear the sound of it
 but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.\u201d ","Jesus answered him
 \u201cAre you a teacher of Israel
 and yet you do not understand these things?","\u201cVery truly
 I tell you
 we speak of what we know and testify to what we have seen; yet you do not receive our testimony. ","If I have told you about earthly things and you do not believe
 how can you believe if I tell you about heavenly things? ","No one has ascended into heaven except the one who descended from heaven
 the Son of Man. ","And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness
 so must the Son of Man be lifted up
 ","that whoever believes in him may have eternal life.","\u201cFor God so loved the world that he gave his only Son
 so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life.","\u201cIndeed
 God did not send the Son into the world to condemn the world
 but in order that the world might be saved through him. ","Those who believe in him are not condemned; but those who do not believe are condemned already
 because they have not believed in the name of the only Son of God. ","And this is the judgment
 that the light has come into the world
 and people loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil. ","For all who do evil hate the light and do not come to the light
 so that their deeds may not be exposed. ","But those who do what is true come to the light
 so that it may be clearly seen that their deeds have been done in God.\u201d","They came to John and said to him
 \u201cRabbi
 the one who was with you across the Jordan
 to whom you testified
 here he is baptizing
 and all are going to him.\u201d ","A Samaritan woman came to draw water
 and Jesus said to her
 \u201cGive me a drink.\u201d ","Jesus answered her
 \u201cIf you knew the gift of God
 and who it is that is saying to you
 \u2018Give me a drink
\u2019 you would have asked him
 and he would have given you living water.\u201d ","Jesus said to her
 \u201cEveryone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again
 ","but those who drink of the water that I will give them will never be thirsty. The water that I will give will become in them a spring of water gushing up to eternal life.\u201d","The woman said to him
 \u201cSir
 give me this water
 so that I may never be thirsty or have to keep coming here to draw water.\u201d","Jesus said to her
 \u201cGo
 call your husband
 and come back.\u201d ","The woman answered him
 \u201cI have no husband.\u201d Jesus said to her
 \u201cYou are right in saying
 \u2018I have no husband\u2019; ","for you have had five husbands
 and the one you have now is not your husband. What you have said is true!\u201d ","Jesus said to her
 \u201cWoman
 believe me
 the hour is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem. ","You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know
 for salvation is from the Jews. ","But the hour is coming
 and is now here
 when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth
 for the Father seeks such as these to worship him. ","God is spirit
 and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.\u201d ","Jesus said to her
 \u201cI am he
 the one who is speaking to you.\u201d","But he said to them
 \u201cI have food to eat that you do not know about.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cMy food is to do the will of him who sent me and to complete his work. ","Do you not say
 \u2018Four months more
 then comes the harvest\u2019? But I tell you
 look around you
 and see how the fields are ripe for harvesting. ","The reaper is already receiving wages and is gathering fruit for eternal life
 so that sower and reaper may rejoice together. ","For here the saying holds true
 \u2018One sows and another reaps.\u2019 ","I sent you to reap that for which you did not labor. Others have labored
 and you have entered into their labor.\u201d","They said to the woman
 \u201cIt is no longer because of what you said that we believe
 for we have heard for ourselves
 and we know that this is truly the Savior of the world.\u201d","Then Jesus said to him
 \u201cUnless you see signs and wonders you will not believe.\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cGo; your son will live.\u201d The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and started on his way. ","So he asked them the hour when he began to recover
 and they said to him
 \u201cYesterday at one in the afternoon the fever left him.\u201d ","The father realized that this was the hour when Jesus had said to him
 \u201cYour son will live.\u201d So he himself believed
 along with his whole household. ","When Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had been there a long time
 he said to him
 \u201cDo you want to be made well?\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cStand up
 take your mat and walk.\u201d ","But he answered them
 \u201cThe man who made me well said to me
 \u2018Take up your mat and walk.\u2019\u201d ","Later Jesus found him in the temple and said to him
 \u201cSee
 you have been made well! Do not sin any more
 so that nothing worse happens to you.\u201d ","But Jesus answered them
 \u201cMy Father is still working
 and I also am working.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cVery truly
 I tell you
 the Son can do nothing on his own
 but only what he sees the Father doing; for whatever the Father does
 the Son does likewise. ","The Father loves the Son and shows him all that he himself is doing; and he will show him greater works than these
 so that you will be astonished. ","Indeed
 just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life
 so also the Son gives life to whomever he wishes. ","The Father judges no one but has given all judgment to the Son
 ","so that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. Anyone who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.","Very truly
 I tell you
 anyone who hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life
 and does not come under judgment
 but has passed from death to life.","\u201cVery truly
 I tell you
 the hour is coming
 and is now here
 when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God
 and those who hear will live. ","For just as the Father has life in himself
 so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself; ","and he has given him authority to execute judgment
 because he is the Son of Man. ","Do not be astonished at this; for the hour is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice","and will come out\u2014those who have done good
 to the resurrection of life
 and those who have done evil
 to the resurrection of condemnation.","\u201cI can do nothing on my own. As I hear
 I judge; and my judgment is just
 because I seek to do not my own will but the will of him who sent me.","\u201cIf I testify about myself
 my testimony is not true. ","There is another who testifies on my behalf
 and I know that his testimony to me is true. ","You sent messengers to John
 and he testified to the truth. ","Not that I accept such human testimony
 but I say these things so that you may be saved. ","He was a burning and shining lamp
 and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light. ","But I have a testimony greater than John\u2019s. The works that the Father has given me to complete
 the very works that I am doing
 testify on my behalf that the Father has sent me. ","And the Father who sent me has himself testified on my behalf. You have never heard his voice or seen his form
 ","and you do not have his word abiding in you
 because you do not believe him whom he has sent.","\u201cYou search the scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is they that testify on my behalf.","Yet you refuse to come to me to have life.","I do not accept glory from human beings.","But I know that you do not have the love of God in you.","I have come in my Father\u2019s name
 and you do not accept me; if another comes in his own name
 you will accept him. ","How can you believe when you accept glory from one another and do not seek the glory that comes from the one who alone is God?","Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father; your accuser is Moses
 on whom you have set your hope. ","If you believed Moses
 you would believe me
 for he wrote about me. ","But if you do not believe what he wrote
 how will you believe what I say?\u201d","When he looked up and saw a large crowd coming toward him
 Jesus said to Philip
 \u201cWhere are we to buy bread for these people to eat?\u201d ","Jesus said
 \u201cMake the people sit down.\u201d Now there was a great deal of grass in the place; so they sat down
 about five thousand in all. ","When they were satisfied
 he told his disciples
 \u201cGather up the fragments left over
 so that nothing may be lost.\u201d ","But he said to them
 \u201cIt is I; do not be afraid.\u201d ","Jesus answered them
 \u201cVery truly
 I tell you
 you are looking for me
 not because you saw signs
 but because you ate your fill of the loaves. ","Do not work for the food that perishes
 but for the food that endures for eternal life
 which the Son of Man will give you. For it is on him that God the Father has set his seal.\u201d ","Jesus answered them
 \u201cThis is the work of God
 that you believe in him whom he has sent.\u201d ","Then Jesus said to them
 \u201cVery truly
 I tell you
 it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven
 but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven. ","For the bread of God is that which comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cI am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never be hungry
 and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty. ","But I said to you that you have seen me and yet do not believe.","Everything that the Father gives me will come to me
 and anyone who comes to me I will never drive away; ","for I have come down from heaven
 not to do my own will
 but the will of him who sent me. ","And this is the will of him who sent me
 that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me
 but raise it up on the last day. ","This is indeed the will of my Father
 that all who see the Son and believe in him may have eternal life; and I will raise them up on the last day.\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cDo not complain among yourselves. ","No one can come to me unless drawn by the Father who sent me; and I will raise that person up on the last day.","It is written in the prophets
 \u2018And they shall all be taught by God.\u2019 Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me. ","Not that anyone has seen the Father except the one who is from God; he has seen the Father.","Very truly
 I tell you
 whoever believes has eternal life. ","I am the bread of life.","Your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness
 and they died. ","This is the bread that comes down from heaven
 so that one may eat of it and not die. ","I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Whoever eats of this bread will live forever; and the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.\u201d","So Jesus said to them
 \u201cVery truly
 I tell you
 unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood
 you have no life in you. ","Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood have eternal life
 and I will raise them up on the last day; ","for my flesh is true food and my blood is true drink.","Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood abide in me
 and I in them. ","Just as the living Father sent me
 and I live because of the Father
 so whoever eats me will live because of me. ","This is the bread that came down from heaven
 not like that which your ancestors ate
 and they died. But the one who eats this bread will live forever.\u201d ","But Jesus
 being aware that his disciples were complaining about it
 said to them
 \u201cDoes this offend you? ","Then what if you were to see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before?","It is the spirit that gives life; the flesh is useless. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life.","But among you there are some who do not believe.\u201d For Jesus knew from the first who were the ones that did not believe
 and who was the one that would betray him. ","And he said
 \u201cFor this reason I have told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted by the Father.\u201d","So Jesus asked the twelve
 \u201cDo you also wish to go away?\u201d ","Jesus answered them
 \u201cDid I not choose you
 the twelve? Yet one of you is a devil.\u201d ","So his brothers said to him
 \u201cLeave here and go to Judea so that your disciples also may see the works you are doing; ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cMy time has not yet come
 but your time is always here. ","The world cannot hate you
 but it hates me because I testify against it that its works are evil. ","Go to the festival yourselves. I am not going to this festival
 for my time has not yet fully come.\u201d ","Then Jesus answered them
 \u201cMy teaching is not mine but his who sent me. ","Anyone who resolves to do the will of God will know whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own.","Those who speak on their own seek their own glory; but the one who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true
 and there is nothing false in him.","\u201cDid not Moses give you the law? Yet none of you keeps the law. Why are you looking for an opportunity to kill me?\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cI performed one work
 and all of you are astonished. ","Moses gave you circumcision (it is
 of course
 not from Moses
 but from the patriarchs)
 and you circumcise a man on the sabbath. ","If a man receives circumcision on the sabbath in order that the law of Moses may not be broken
 are you angry with me because I healed a man\u2019s whole body on the sabbath? ","Do not judge by appearances
 but judge with right judgment.\u201d","Now some of the people of Jerusalem were saying
 \u201cIs not this the man whom they are trying to kill? ","Then Jesus cried out as he was teaching in the temple
 \u201cYou know me
 and you know where I am from. I have not come on my own. But the one who sent me is true
 and you do not know him. ","I know him
 because I am from him
 and he sent me.\u201d ","Jesus then said
 \u201cI will be with you a little while longer
 and then I am going to him who sent me. ","You will search for me
 but you will not find me; and where I am
 you cannot come.\u201d ","The Jews said to one another
 \u201cWhere does this man intend to go that we will not find him? Does he intend to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks? ","On the last day of the festival
 the great day
 while Jesus was standing there
 he cried out
 \u201cLet anyone who is thirsty come to me
 ","and let the one who believes in me drink. As the scripture has said
 \u2018Out of the believer\u2019s heart shall flow rivers of living water.\u2019\u201d ","Now he said this about the Spirit
 which believers in him were to receive; for as yet there was no Spirit
 because Jesus was not yet glorified.","they said to him
 \u201cTeacher
 this woman was caught in the very act of committing adultery. ","When they kept on questioning him
 he straightened up and said to them
 \u201cLet anyone among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.\u201d ","Jesus straightened up and said to her
 \u201cWoman
 where are they? Has no one condemned you?\u201d ","She said
 \u201cNo one
 sir.\u201d And Jesus said
 \u201cNeither do I condemn you. Go your way
 and from now on do not sin again.\u201d]]","Again Jesus spoke to them
 saying
 \u201cI am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness but will have the light of life.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cEven if I testify on my own behalf
 my testimony is valid because I know where I have come from and where I am going
 but you do not know where I come from or where I am going. ","You judge by human standards; I judge no one.","Yet even if I do judge
 my judgment is valid; for it is not I alone who judge
 but I and the Father who sent me. ","In your law it is written that the testimony of two witnesses is valid.","I testify on my own behalf
 and the Father who sent me testifies on my behalf.\u201d ","Then they said to him
 \u201cWhere is your Father?\u201d Jesus answered
 \u201cYou know neither me nor my Father. If you knew me
 you would know my Father also.\u201d ","Again he said to them
 \u201cI am going away
 and you will search for me
 but you will die in your sin. Where I am going
 you cannot come.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cYou are from below
 I am from above; you are of this world
 I am not of this world. ","I told you that you would die in your sins
 for you will die in your sins unless you believe that I am he.\u201d ","They said to him
 \u201cWho are you?\u201d Jesus said to them
 \u201cWhy do I speak to you at all? ","I have much to say about you and much to condemn; but the one who sent me is true
 and I declare to the world what I have heard from him.\u201d ","So Jesus said
 \u201cWhen you have lifted up the Son of Man
 then you will realize that I am he
 and that I do nothing on my own
 but I speak these things as the Father instructed me. ","And the one who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone
 for I always do what is pleasing to him.\u201d ","Then Jesus said to the Jews who had believed in him
 \u201cIf you continue in my word
 you are truly my disciples; ","and you will know the truth
 and the truth will make you free.\u201d ","Jesus answered them
 \u201cVery truly
 I tell you
 everyone who commits sin is a slave to sin. ","The slave does not have a permanent place in the household; the son has a place there forever.","So if the Son makes you free
 you will be free indeed. ","I know that you are descendants of Abraham; yet you look for an opportunity to kill me
 because there is no place in you for my word. ","I declare what I have seen in the Father\u2019s presence; as for you
 you should do what you have heard from the Father.\u201d","They answered him
 \u201cAbraham is our father.\u201d Jesus said to them
 \u201cIf you were Abraham\u2019s children
 you would be doing what Abraham did
 ","but now you are trying to kill me
 a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. This is not what Abraham did. ","You are indeed doing what your father does.\u201d They said to him
 \u201cWe are not illegitimate children; we have one father
 God himself.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cIf God were your Father
 you would love me
 for I came from God and now I am here. I did not come on my own
 but he sent me. ","Why do you not understand what I say? It is because you cannot accept my word.","You are from your father the devil
 and you choose to do your father\u2019s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth
 because there is no truth in him. When he lies
 he speaks according to his own nature
 for he is a liar and the father of lies. ","But because I tell the truth
 you do not believe me. ","Which of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth
 why do you not believe me? ","Whoever is from God hears the words of God. The reason you do not hear them is that you are not from God.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cI do not have a demon; but I honor my Father
 and you dishonor me. ","Yet I do not seek my own glory; there is one who seeks it and he is the judge.","Very truly
 I tell you
 whoever keeps my word will never see death.\u201d ","The Jews said to him
 \u201cNow we know that you have a demon. Abraham died
 and so did the prophets; yet you say
 \u2018Whoever keeps my word will never taste death.\u2019 ","Jesus answered
 \u201cIf I glorify myself
 my glory is nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me
 he of whom you say
 \u2018He is our God
\u2019 ","though you do not know him. But I know him; if I would say that I do not know him
 I would be a liar like you. But I do know him and I keep his word. ","Your ancestor Abraham rejoiced that he would see my day; he saw it and was glad.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cVery truly
 I tell you
 before Abraham was
 I am.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cNeither this man nor his parents sinned; he was born blind so that God\u2019s works might be revealed in him. ","We must work the works of him who sent me while it is day; night is coming when no one can work.","As long as I am in the world
 I am the light of the world.\u201d ","saying to him
 \u201cGo
 wash in the pool of Siloam\u201d (which means Sent). Then he went and washed and came back able to see. ","He answered
 \u201cThe man called Jesus made mud
 spread it on my eyes
 and said to me
 \u2018Go to Siloam and wash.\u2019 Then I went and washed and received my sight.\u201d ","They said to him
 \u201cWhere is he?\u201d He said
 \u201cI do not know.\u201d","So for the second time they called the man who had been blind
 and they said to him
 \u201cGive glory to God! We know that this man is a sinner.\u201d ","He answered
 \u201cI do not know whether he is a sinner. One thing I do know
 that though I was blind
 now I see.\u201d ","They said to him
 \u201cWhat did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?\u201d ","He answered them
 \u201cI have told you already
 and you would not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also want to become his disciples?\u201d ","Jesus heard that they had driven him out
 and when he found him
 he said
 \u201cDo you believe in the Son of Man?\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cYou have seen him
 and the one speaking with you is he.\u201d ","Jesus said
 \u201cI came into this world for judgment so that those who do not see may see
 and those who do see may become blind.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cIf you were blind
 you would not have sin. But now that you say
 \u2018We see
\u2019 your sin remains.","\u201cVery truly
 I tell you
 anyone who does not enter the sheepfold by the gate but climbs in by another way is a thief and a bandit. ","The one who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep.","The gatekeeper opens the gate for him
 and the sheep hear his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. ","When he has brought out all his own
 he goes ahead of them
 and the sheep follow him because they know his voice. ","They will not follow a stranger
 but they will run from him because they do not know the voice of strangers.\u201d ","So again Jesus said to them
 \u201cVery truly
 I tell you
 I am the gate for the sheep. ","All who came before me are thieves and bandits; but the sheep did not listen to them.","I am the gate. Whoever enters by me will be saved
 and will come in and go out and find pasture. ","The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life
 and have it abundantly.","\u201cI am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.","The hired hand
 who is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep
 sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and runs away\u2014and the wolf snatches them and scatters them. ","The hired hand runs away because a hired hand does not care for the sheep.","I am the good shepherd. I know my own and my own know me
 ","just as the Father knows me and I know the Father. And I lay down my life for the sheep.","I have other sheep that do not belong to this fold. I must bring them also
 and they will listen to my voice. So there will be one flock
 one shepherd. ","For this reason the Father loves me
 because I lay down my life in order to take it up again. ","No one takes it from me
 but I lay it down of my own accord. I have power to lay it down
 and I have power to take it up again. I have received this command from my Father.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cI have told you
 and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father\u2019s name testify to me; ","but you do not believe
 because you do not belong to my sheep. ","My sheep hear my voice. I know them
 and they follow me. ","I give them eternal life
 and they will never perish. No one will snatch them out of my hand. ","What my Father has given me is greater than all else
 and no one can snatch it out of the Father\u2019s hand. ","The Father and I are one.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cI have shown you many good works from the Father. For which of these are you going to stone me?\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cIs it not written in your law
 \u2018I said
 you are gods\u2019? ","If those to whom the word of God came were called \u2018gods\u2019\u2014and the scripture cannot be annulled\u2014","can you say that the one whom the Father has sanctified and sent into the world is blaspheming because I said
 \u2018I am God\u2019s Son\u2019? ","If I am not doing the works of my Father
 then do not believe me. ","But if I do them
 even though you do not believe me
 believe the works
 so that you may know and understand that the Father is in me and I am in the Father.\u201d ","But when Jesus heard it
 he said
 \u201cThis illness does not lead to death; rather it is for God\u2019s glory
 so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.\u201d ","Then after this he said to the disciples
 \u201cLet us go to Judea again.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cAre there not twelve hours of daylight? Those who walk during the day do not stumble
 because they see the light of this world. ","But those who walk at night stumble
 because the light is not in them.\u201d ","After saying this
 he told them
 \u201cOur friend Lazarus has fallen asleep
 but I am going there to awaken him.\u201d ","Then Jesus told them plainly
 \u201cLazarus is dead. ","For your sake I am glad I was not there
 so that you may believe. But let us go to him.\u201d ","Thomas
 who was called the Twin
 said to his fellow disciples
 \u201cLet us also go
 that we may die with him.\u201d","Jesus said to her
 \u201cYour brother will rise again.\u201d ","Jesus said to her
 \u201cI am the resurrection and the life. Those who believe in me
 even though they die
 will live
 ","and everyone who lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?\u201d","She said to him
 \u201cYes
 Lord
 I believe that you are the Messiah
 the Son of God
 the one coming into the world.\u201d","When Mary came where Jesus was and saw him
 she knelt at his feet and said to him
 \u201cLord
 if you had been here
 my brother would not have died.\u201d ","He said
 \u201cWhere have you laid him?\u201d They said to him
 \u201cLord
 come and see.\u201d ","Jesus said
 \u201cTake away the stone.\u201d Martha
 the sister of the dead man
 said to him
 \u201cLord
 already there is a stench because he has been dead four days.\u201d ","Jesus said to her
 \u201cDid I not tell you that if you believed
 you would see the glory of God?\u201d ","So they took away the stone. And Jesus looked upward and said
 \u201cFather
 I thank you for having heard me. ","I knew that you always hear me
 but I have said this for the sake of the crowd standing here
 so that they may believe that you sent me.\u201d ","When he had said this
 he cried with a loud voice
 \u201cLazarus
 come out!\u201d ","The dead man came out
 his hands and feet bound with strips of cloth
 and his face wrapped in a cloth. Jesus said to them
 \u201cUnbind him
 and let him go.\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cLeave her alone. She bought it so that she might keep it for the day of my burial. ","You always have the poor with you
 but you do not always have me.\u201d","So the crowd that had been with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to testify.","The Pharisees then said to one another
 \u201cYou see
 you can do nothing. Look
 the world has gone after him!\u201d","They came to Philip
 who was from Bethsaida in Galilee
 and said to him
 \u201cSir
 we wish to see Jesus.\u201d ","Jesus answered them
 \u201cThe hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. ","Very truly
 I tell you
 unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies
 it remains just a single grain; but if it dies
 it bears much fruit. ","Those who love their life lose it
 and those who hate their life in this world will keep it for eternal life. ","Whoever serves me must follow me
 and where I am
 there will my servant be also. Whoever serves me
 the Father will honor.","\u201cNow my soul is troubled. And what should I say\u2014\u2018Father
 save me from this hour\u2019? No
 it is for this reason that I have come to this hour. ","Father
 glorify your name.\u201d Then a voice came from heaven
 \u201cI have glorified it
 and I will glorify it again.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cThis voice has come for your sake
 not for mine. ","Now is the judgment of this world; now the ruler of this world will be driven out.","And I
 when I am lifted up from the earth
 will draw all people to myself.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cThe light is with you for a little longer. Walk while you have the light
 so that the darkness may not overtake you. If you walk in the darkness
 you do not know where you are going. ","While you have the light
 believe in the light
 so that you may become children of light.\u201d After Jesus had said this
 he departed and hid from them. ","Then Jesus cried aloud: \u201cWhoever believes in me believes not in me but in him who sent me.","And whoever sees me sees him who sent me.","I have come as light into the world
 so that everyone who believes in me should not remain in the darkness. ","I do not judge anyone who hears my words and does not keep them
 for I came not to judge the world
 but to save the world. ","The one who rejects me and does not receive my word has a judge; on the last day the word that I have spoken will serve as judge
 ","for I have not spoken on my own
 but the Father who sent me has himself given me a commandment about what to say and what to speak. ","And I know that his commandment is eternal life. What I speak
 therefore
 I speak just as the Father has told me.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cYou do not know now what I am doing
 but later you will understand.\u201d ","Peter said to him
 \u201cYou will never wash my feet.\u201d Jesus answered
 \u201cUnless I wash you
 you have no share with me.\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cOne who has bathed does not need to wash
 except for the feet
 but is entirely clean. And you are clean
 though not all of you.\u201d ","For he knew who was to betray him; for this reason he said
 \u201cNot all of you are clean.\u201d","After he had washed their feet
 had put on his robe
 and had returned to the table
 he said to them
 \u201cDo you know what I have done to you? ","You call me Teacher and Lord\u2014and you are right
 for that is what I am. ","So if I
 your Lord and Teacher
 have washed your feet
 you also ought to wash one another\u2019s feet. ","For I have set you an example
 that you also should do as I have done to you. ","Very truly
 I tell you
 servants are not greater than their master
 nor are messengers greater than the one who sent them. ","If you know these things
 you are blessed if you do them. ","I am not speaking of all of you; I know whom I have chosen. But it is to fulfill the scripture
 \u2018The one who ate my bread has lifted his heel against me.\u2019 ","I tell you this now
 before it occurs
 so that when it does occur
 you may believe that I am he. ","Very truly
 I tell you
 whoever receives one whom I send receives me; and whoever receives me receives him who sent me.\u201d","After saying this Jesus was troubled in spirit
 and declared
 \u201cVery truly
 I tell you
 one of you will betray me.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cIt is the one to whom I give this piece of bread when I have dipped it in the dish.\u201d So when he had dipped the piece of bread
 he gave it to Judas son of Simon Iscariot. ","After he received the piece of bread
 Satan entered into him. Jesus said to him
 \u201cDo quickly what you are going to do.\u201d ","When he had gone out

 \u201cNow the Son of Man has been glorified

 God will also glorify him in himself and will glorify him at once. ","Little children
 I am with you only a little longer. You will look for me; and as I said to the Jews so now I say to you
 \u2018Where I am going
 you cannot come.\u2019 ","I give you a new commandment
 that you love one another. Just as I have loved you
 you also should love one another. ","By this everyone will know that you are my disciples

 \u201cLord
 where are you going?\u201d Jesus answered

 I tell you
 before the cock crows
 you will have denied me three times.","\u201cDo not let your hearts be troubled. Believe in God

 I will come again and will take you to myself

 there you may be also. ","And you know the way to the place where I am going.\u201d","Jesus said to him

 \u2018Show us the Father\u2019? ","Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own; but the Father who dwells in me does his works.","Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; but if you do not
 then believe me because of the works themselves. ","Very truly
 I tell you
 the one who believes in me will also do the works that I do and
 in fact
 will do greater works than these

 so that the Father may be glorified in the Son. ","If in my name you ask me for anything
 I will do it.","\u201cIf you love me
 you will keep my commandments. ","And I will ask the Father
 and he will give you another Advocate
 to be with you forever. ","This is the Spirit of truth

 because he abides with you
 and he will be in you.","\u201cI will not leave you orphaned; I am coming to you.","In a little while the world will no longer see me
 but you will see me; because I live
 you also will live. ","On that day you will know that I am in my Father
 and you in me

 and I will love them and reveal myself to them.\u201d ","Judas (not Iscariot) said to him
 \u201cLord
 how is it that you will reveal yourself to us

 \u201cThose who love me will keep my word
 and my Father will love them

 but is from the Father who sent me.","\u201cI have said these things to you while I am still with you.","But the Advocate
 the Holy Spirit

 will teach you everything
 and remind you of all that I have said to you. ","Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled
 and do not let them be afraid. ","You heard me say to you
 \u2018I am going away

 you would rejoice that I am going to the Father

 you may believe. ","I will no longer talk much with you

 let us be on our way.","\u201cI am the true vine
 and my Father is the vinegrower. ","He removes every branch in me that bears no fruit. Every branch that bears fruit he prunes to make it bear more fruit.","You have already been cleansed by the word that I have spoken to you.","Abide in me as I abide in you. Just as the branch cannot bear fruit by itself unless it abides in the vine
 neither can you unless you abide in me. ","I am the vine
 you are the branches. Those who abide in me and I in them bear much fruit
 because apart from me you can do nothing. ","Whoever does not abide in me is thrown away like a branch and withers; such branches are gathered
 thrown into the fire

 ask for whatever you wish

 fruit that will last

 be aware that it hated me before it hated you. ","If you belonged to the world
 the world would love you as its own. Because you do not belong to the world

 \u2018Servants are not greater than their master.\u2019 If they persecuted me
 they will persecute you; if they kept my word

 \u2018Where are you going?\u2019 ","But because I have said these things to you
 sorrow has filled your hearts. ","Nevertheless I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away

 the Advocate will not come to you; but if I go
 I will send him to you. ","And when he comes
 he will prove the world wrong about sin and righteousness and judgment: ","about sin

 because I am going to the Father and you will see me no longer; ","about judgment
 because the ruler of this world has been condemned.","\u201cI still have many things to say to you
 but you cannot bear them now. ","When the Spirit of truth comes
 he will guide you into all the truth; for he will not speak on his own
 but will speak whatever he hears

 you will weep and mourn

 \u201cDo you ask this on your own
 or did others tell you about me?\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cMy kingdom is not from this world. If my kingdom were from this world
 my followers would be fighting to keep me from being handed over to the Jews. But as it is
 my kingdom is not from here.\u201d ","Pilate asked him
 \u201cSo you are a king?\u201d Jesus answered
 \u201cYou say that I am a king. For this I was born
 and for this I came into the world
 to testify to the truth. Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice.\u201d ","Pilate went out again and said to them
 \u201cLook
 I am bringing him out to you to let you know that I find no case against him.\u201d ","So Jesus came out
 wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them
 \u201cHere is the man!\u201d ","When the chief priests and the police saw him
 they shouted
 \u201cCrucify him! Crucify him!\u201d Pilate said to them
 \u201cTake him yourselves and crucify him; I find no case against him.\u201d ","Jesus answered him
 \u201cYou would have no power over me unless it had been given you from above; therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin.\u201d ","Now it was the day of Preparation for the Passover; and it was about noon. He said to the Jews
 \u201cHere is your King!\u201d ","When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing beside her
 he said to his mother
 \u201cWoman
 here is your son.\u201d ","Then he said to the disciple
 \u201cHere is your mother.\u201d And from that hour the disciple took her into his own home.","After this
 when Jesus knew that all was now finished
 he said (in order to fulfill the scripture)
 \u201cI am thirsty.\u201d ","When Jesus had received the wine
 he said
 \u201cIt is finished.\u201d Then he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.","So she ran and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple
 the one whom Jesus loved
 and said to them
 \u201cThey have taken the Lord out of the tomb
 and we do not know where they have laid him.\u201d ","They said to her
 \u201cWoman
 why are you weeping?\u201d She said to them
 \u201cThey have taken away my Lord
 and I do not know where they have laid him.\u201d ","Jesus said to her
 \u201cWoman
 why are you weeping? Whom are you looking for?\u201d Supposing him to be the gardener
 she said to him
 \u201cSir
 if you have carried him away
 tell me where you have laid him
 and I will take him away.\u201d ","Jesus said to her
 \u201cMary!\u201d She turned and said to him in Hebrew
 \u201cRabbouni!\u201d (which means Teacher). ","Jesus said to her
 \u201cDo not hold on to me
 because I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers and say to them
 \u2018I am ascending to my Father and your Father
 to my God and your God.\u2019\u201d ","When it was evening on that day
 the first day of the week
 and the doors of the house where the disciples had met were locked for fear of the Jews
 Jesus came and stood among them and said
 \u201cPeace be with you.\u201d ","Jesus said to them again
 \u201cPeace be with you. As the Father has sent me
 so I send you.\u201d ","When he had said this
 he breathed on them and said to them
 \u201cReceive the Holy Spirit. ","If you forgive the sins of any
 they are forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any
 they are retained.\u201d","So the other disciples told him
 \u201cWe have seen the Lord.\u201d But he said to them
 \u201cUnless I see the mark of the nails in his hands
 and put my finger in the mark of the nails and my hand in his side
 I will not believe.\u201d","A week later his disciples were again in the house
 and Thomas was with them. Although the doors were shut
 Jesus came and stood among them and said
 \u201cPeace be with you.\u201d ","Then he said to Thomas
 \u201cPut your finger here and see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it in my side. Do not doubt but believe.\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cHave you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have come to believe.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cChildren
 you have no fish
 have you?\u201d They answered him
 \u201cNo.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cBring some of the fish that you have just caught.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cCome and have breakfast.\u201d Now none of the disciples dared to ask him
 \u201cWho are you?\u201d because they knew it was the Lord. ","When they had finished breakfast
 Jesus said to Simon Peter
 \u201cSimon son of John
 do you love me more than these?\u201d He said to him
 \u201cYes
 Lord; you know that I love you.\u201d Jesus said to him
 \u201cFeed my lambs.\u201d ","A second time he said to him
 \u201cSimon son of John
 do you love me?\u201d He said to him
 \u201cYes
 Lord; you know that I love you.\u201d Jesus said to him
 \u201cTend my sheep.\u201d ","He said to him the third time
 \u201cSimon son of John
 do you love me?\u201d Peter felt hurt because he said to him the third time
 \u201cDo you love me?\u201d And he said to him
 \u201cLord
 you know everything; you know that I love you.\u201d Jesus said to him
 \u201cFeed my sheep. ","Very truly
 I tell you
 when you were younger
 you used to fasten your own belt and to go wherever you wished. But when you grow old
 you will stretch out your hands
 and someone else will fasten a belt around you and take you where you do not wish to go.\u201d ","(He said this to indicate the kind of death by which he would glorify God.) After this he said to him
 \u201cFollow me.\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cIf it is my will that he remain until I come
 what is that to you? Follow me!\u201d ","So the rumor spread in the community that this disciple would not die. Yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die
 but
 \u201cIf it is my will that he remain until I come
 what is that to you?\u201d","And they asked him
 \u2018What then? Are you Elijah?\u2019 He said
 \u2018I am not.\u2019 \u2018Are you the prophet?\u2019 He answered
 \u2018No.\u2019 ","Then they said to him
 \u2018Who are you? Let us have an answer for those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?\u2019 ","He said
 \u2018I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness
 \u201cMake straight the way of the Lord\u201d\u2019
 as the prophet Isaiah said.","When Jesus turned and saw them following
 he said to them
 \u2018What are you looking for?\u2019 They said to him
 \u2018Rabbi\u2019 (which translated means Teacher)
 \u2018where are you staying?\u2019 ","He said to them
 \u2018Come and see.\u2019 They came and saw where he was staying
 and they remained with him that day. It was about four o\u2019clock in the afternoon. ","He brought Simon to Jesus
 who looked at him and said
 \u2018You are Simon son of John. You are to be called Cephas\u2019 (which is translated Peter).","The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee. He found Philip and said to him
 \u2018Follow me.\u2019 ","Philip found Nathanael and said to him
 \u2018We have found him about whom Moses in the law and also the prophets wrote
 Jesus son of Joseph from Nazareth.\u2019 ","Nathanael said to him
 \u2018Can anything good come out of Nazareth?\u2019 Philip said to him
 \u2018Come and see.\u2019 ","When Jesus saw Nathanael coming towards him
 he said of him
 \u2018Here is truly an Israelite in whom there is no deceit!\u2019 ","Nathanael asked him
 \u2018Where did you come to know me?\u2019 Jesus answered
 \u2018I saw you under the fig tree before Philip called you.\u2019 ","Jesus answered
 \u2018Do you believe because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree? You will see greater things than these.\u2019 ","And he said to him
 \u2018Very truly
 I tell you
 you will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.\u2019","And Jesus said to her
 \u2018Woman
 what concern is that to you and to me? My hour has not yet come.\u2019 ","Jesus said to them
 \u2018Fill the jars with water.\u2019 And they filled them up to the brim. ","He said to them
 \u2018Now draw some out
 and take it to the chief steward.\u2019 So they took it. ","He told those who were selling the doves
 \u2018Take these things out of here! Stop making my Father\u2019s house a market-place!\u2019 ","Jesus answered them
 \u2018Destroy this temple
 and in three days I will raise it up.\u2019 ","Jesus answered him
 \u2018Very truly
 I tell you
 no one can see the kingdom of God without being born from above.\u2019 ","Jesus answered
 \u2018Very truly
 I tell you
 no one can enter the kingdom of God without being born of water and Spirit. ","What is born of the flesh is flesh
 and what is born of the Spirit is spirit. ","Do not be astonished that I said to you
 \u201cYou must be born from above.\u201d ","The wind blows where it chooses
 and you hear the sound of it
 but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.\u2019 ","Jesus answered him
 \u2018Are you a teacher of Israel
 and yet you do not understand these things?","\u2018Very truly
 I tell you
 we speak of what we know and testify to what we have seen; yet you do not receive our testimony. ","If I have told you about earthly things and you do not believe
 how can you believe if I tell you about heavenly things? ","No one has ascended into heaven except the one who descended from heaven
 the Son of Man. ","And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness
 so must the Son of Man be lifted up
 ","that whoever believes in him may have eternal life.","\u2018For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son
 so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life.","\u2018Indeed
 God did not send the Son into the world to condemn the world
 but in order that the world might be saved through him. ","Those who believe in him are not condemned; but those who do not believe are condemned already
 because they have not believed in the name of the only Son of God. ","And this is the judgement
 that the light has come into the world
 and people loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil. ","For all who do evil hate the light and do not come to the light
 so that their deeds may not be exposed. ","But those who do what is true come to the light
 so that it may be clearly seen that their deeds have been done in God.\u2019","They came to John and said to him
 \u2018Rabbi
 the one who was with you across the Jordan
 to whom you testified
 here he is baptizing
 and all are going to him.\u2019 ","A Samaritan woman came to draw water
 and Jesus said to her
 \u2018Give me a drink\u2019. ","Jesus answered her
 \u2018If you knew the gift of God
 and who it is that is saying to you
 \u201cGive me a drink\u201d
 you would have asked him
 and he would have given you living water.\u2019 ","Jesus said to her
 \u2018Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again
 ","but those who drink of the water that I will give them will never be thirsty. The water that I will give will become in them a spring of water gushing up to eternal life.\u2019","The woman said to him
 \u2018Sir
 give me this water
 so that I may never be thirsty or have to keep coming here to draw water.\u2019","Jesus said to her
 \u2018Go
 call your husband
 and come back.\u2019 ","The woman answered him
 \u2018I have no husband.\u2019 Jesus said to her
 \u2018You are right in saying
 \u201cI have no husband\u201d; ","for you have had five husbands
 and the one you have now is not your husband. What you have said is true!\u2019 ","Jesus said to her
 \u2018Woman
 believe me
 the hour is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem. ","You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know
 for salvation is from the Jews. ","But the hour is coming
 and is now here
 when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth
 for the Father seeks such as these to worship him. ","God is spirit
 and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.\u2019 ","Jesus said to her
 \u2018I am he
 the one who is speaking to you.\u2019","But he said to them
 \u2018I have food to eat that you do not know about.\u2019 ","Jesus said to them
 \u2018My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to complete his work. ","Do you not say
 \u201cFour months more
 then comes the harvest\u201d? But I tell you
 look around you
 and see how the fields are ripe for harvesting. ","The reaper is already receiving wages and is gathering fruit for eternal life
 so that sower and reaper may rejoice together. ","For here the saying holds true
 \u201cOne sows and another reaps.\u201d ","I sent you to reap that for which you did not labour. Others have laboured
 and you have entered into their labour.\u2019","They said to the woman
 \u2018It is no longer because of what you said that we believe
 for we have heard for ourselves
 and we know that this is truly the Saviour of the world.\u2019","Then Jesus said to him
 \u2018Unless you see signs and wonders you will not believe.\u2019 ","Jesus said to him
 \u2018Go; your son will live.\u2019 The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and started on his way. ","So he asked them the hour when he began to recover
 and they said to him
 \u2018Yesterday at one in the afternoon the fever left him.\u2019 ","The father realized that this was the hour when Jesus had said to him
 \u2018Your son will live.\u2019 So he himself believed
 along with his whole household. ","When Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had been there a long time
 he said to him
 \u2018Do you want to be made well?\u2019 ","Jesus said to him
 \u2018Stand up
 take your mat and walk.\u2019 ","But he answered them
 \u2018The man who made me well said to me
 \u201cTake up your mat and walk.\u201d\u2019 ","Later Jesus found him in the temple and said to him
 \u2018See
 you have been made well! Do not sin any more
 so that nothing worse happens to you.\u2019 ","But Jesus answered them
 \u2018My Father is still working
 and I also am working.\u2019 ","Jesus said to them
 \u2018Very truly
 I tell you
 the Son can do nothing on his own
 but only what he sees the Father doing; for whatever the Father does
 the Son does likewise. ","The Father loves the Son and shows him all that he himself is doing; and he will show him greater works than these
 so that you will be astonished. ","Indeed
 just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life
 so also the Son gives life to whomsoever he wishes. ","The Father judges no one but has given all judgement to the Son
 ","so that all may honour the Son just as they honour the Father. Anyone who does not honour the Son does not honour the Father who sent him.","Very truly
 I tell you
 anyone who hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life
 and does not come under judgement
 but has passed from death to life.","\u2018Very truly
 I tell you
 the hour is coming
 and is now here
 when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God
 and those who hear will live. ","For just as the Father has life in himself
 so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself; ","and he has given him authority to execute judgement
 because he is the Son of Man. ","Do not be astonished at this; for the hour is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice","and will come out\u2014those who have done good
 to the resurrection of life
 and those who have done evil
 to the resurrection of condemnation.","\u2018I can do nothing on my own. As I hear
 I judge; and my judgement is just
 because I seek to do not my own will but the will of him who sent me.","\u2018If I testify about myself
 my testimony is not true. ","There is another who testifies on my behalf
 and I know that his testimony to me is true. ","You sent messengers to John
 and he testified to the truth. ","Not that I accept such human testimony
 but I say these things so that you may be saved. ","He was a burning and shining lamp
 and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light. ","But I have a testimony greater than John\u2019s. The works that the Father has given me to complete
 the very works that I am doing
 testify on my behalf that the Father has sent me. ","And the Father who sent me has himself testified on my behalf. You have never heard his voice or seen his form
 ","and you do not have his word abiding in you
 because you do not believe him whom he has sent.","\u2018You search the scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is they that testify on my behalf.","Yet you refuse to come to me to have life.","I do not accept glory from human beings.","But I know that you do not have the love of God in you.","I have come in my Father\u2019s name
 and you do not accept me; if another comes in his own name
 you will accept him. ","How can you believe when you accept glory from one another and do not seek the glory that comes from the one who alone is God?","Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father; your accuser is Moses
 on whom you have set your hope. ","If you believed Moses
 you would believe me
 for he wrote about me. ","But if you do not believe what he wrote
 how will you believe what I say?\u2019","When he looked up and saw a large crowd coming towards him
 Jesus said to Philip
 \u2018Where are we to buy bread for these people to eat?\u2019 ","Jesus said
 \u2018Make the people sit down.\u2019 Now there was a great deal of grass in the place; so they sat down
 about five thousand in all. ","When they were satisfied
 he told his disciples
 \u2018Gather up the fragments left over
 so that nothing may be lost.\u2019 ","But he said to them
 \u2018It is I; do not be afraid.\u2019 ","Jesus answered them
 \u2018Very truly
 I tell you
 you are looking for me
 not because you saw signs
 but because you ate your fill of the loaves. ","Do not work for the food that perishes
 but for the food that endures for eternal life
 which the Son of Man will give you. For it is on him that God the Father has set his seal.\u2019 ","Jesus answered them
 \u2018This is the work of God
 that you believe in him whom he has sent.\u2019 ","Then Jesus said to them
 \u2018Very truly
 I tell you
 it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven
 but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven. ","For the bread of God is that which comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.\u2019","Jesus said to them
 \u2018I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never be hungry
 and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty. ","But I said to you that you have seen me and yet do not believe.","Everything that the Father gives me will come to me
 and anyone who comes to me I will never drive away; ","for I have come down from heaven
 not to do my own will
 but the will of him who sent me. ","And this is the will of him who sent me
 that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me
 but raise it up on the last day. ","This is indeed the will of my Father
 that all who see the Son and believe in him may have eternal life; and I will raise them up on the last day.\u2019","Jesus answered them
 \u2018Do not complain among yourselves. ","No one can come to me unless drawn by the Father who sent me; and I will raise that person up on the last day.","It is written in the prophets
 \u201cAnd they shall all be taught by God.\u201d Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me. ","Not that anyone has seen the Father except the one who is from God; he has seen the Father.","Very truly
 I tell you
 whoever believes has eternal life. ","I am the bread of life.","Your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness
 and they died. ","This is the bread that comes down from heaven
 so that one may eat of it and not die. ","I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Whoever eats of this bread will live for ever; and the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.\u2019","So Jesus said to them
 \u2018Very truly
 I tell you
 unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood
 you have no life in you. ","Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood have eternal life
 and I will raise them up on the last day; ","for my flesh is true food and my blood is true drink.","Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood abide in me
 and I in them. ","Just as the living Father sent me
 and I live because of the Father
 so whoever eats me will live because of me. ","This is the bread that came down from heaven
 not like that which your ancestors ate
 and they died. But the one who eats this bread will live for ever.\u2019 ","But Jesus
 being aware that his disciples were complaining about it
 said to them
 \u2018Does this offend you? ","Then what if you were to see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before?","It is the spirit that gives life; the flesh is useless. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life.","But among you there are some who do not believe.\u2019 For Jesus knew from the first who were the ones that did not believe
 and who was the one that would betray him. ","And he said
 \u2018For this reason I have told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted by the Father.\u2019","So Jesus asked the twelve
 \u2018Do you also wish to go away?\u2019 ","Jesus answered them
 \u2018Did I not choose you
 the twelve? Yet one of you is a devil.\u2019 ","So his brothers said to him
 \u2018Leave here and go to Judea so that your disciples also may see the works you are doing; ","Jesus said to them
 \u2018My time has not yet come
 but your time is always here. ","The world cannot hate you
 but it hates me because I testify against it that its works are evil. ","Go to the festival yourselves. I am not going to this festival
 for my time has not yet fully come.\u2019 ","Then Jesus answered them
 \u2018My teaching is not mine but his who sent me. ","Anyone who resolves to do the will of God will know whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own.","Those who speak on their own seek their own glory; but the one who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true
 and there is nothing false in him.","\u2018Did not Moses give you the law? Yet none of you keeps the law. Why are you looking for an opportunity to kill me?\u2019","Jesus answered them
 \u2018I performed one work
 and all of you are astonished. ","Moses gave you circumcision (it is
 of course
 not from Moses
 but from the patriarchs)
 and you circumcise a man on the sabbath. ","If a man receives circumcision on the sabbath in order that the law of Moses may not be broken
 are you angry with me because I healed a man\u2019s whole body on the sabbath? ","Do not judge by appearances
 but judge with right judgement.\u2019","Now some of the people of Jerusalem were saying
 \u2018Is not this the man whom they are trying to kill? ","Then Jesus cried out as he was teaching in the temple
 \u2018You know me
 and you know where I am from. I have not come on my own. But the one who sent me is true
 and you do not know him. ","I know him
 because I am from him
 and he sent me.\u2019 ","Jesus then said
 \u2018I will be with you a little while longer
 and then I am going to him who sent me. ","You will search for me
 but you will not find me; and where I am
 you cannot come.\u2019 ","The Jews said to one another
 \u2018Where does this man intend to go that we will not find him? Does he intend to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks? ","On the last day of the festival
 the great day
 while Jesus was standing there
 he cried out
 \u2018Let anyone who is thirsty come to me
 ","and let the one who believes in me drink. As the scripture has said
 \u201cOut of the believer\u2019s heart shall flow rivers of living water.\u201d\u2019 ","Now he said this about the Spirit
 which believers in him were to receive; for as yet there was no Spirit
 because Jesus was not yet glorified.","they said to him
 \u2018Teacher
 this woman was caught in the very act of committing adultery. ","When they kept on questioning him
 he straightened up and said to them
 \u2018Let anyone among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.\u2019 ","Jesus straightened up and said to her
 \u2018Woman
 where are they? Has no one condemned you?\u2019 ","She said
 \u2018No one
 sir.\u2019 And Jesus said
 \u2018Neither do I condemn you. Go your way
 and from now on do not sin again.\u2019]]","Again Jesus spoke to them
 saying
 \u2018I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness but will have the light of life.\u2019 ","Jesus answered
 \u2018Even if I testify on my own behalf
 my testimony is valid because I know where I have come from and where I am going
 but you do not know where I come from or where I am going. ","You judge by human standards; I judge no one.","Yet even if I do judge
 my judgement is valid; for it is not I alone who judge
 but I and the Father who sent me. ","In your law it is written that the testimony of two witnesses is valid.","I testify on my own behalf
 and the Father who sent me testifies on my behalf.\u2019 ","Then they said to him
 \u2018Where is your Father?\u2019 Jesus answered
 \u2018You know neither me nor my Father. If you knew me
 you would know my Father also.\u2019 ","Again he said to them
 \u2018I am going away
 and you will search for me
 but you will die in your sin. Where I am going
 you cannot come.\u2019 ","He said to them
 \u2018You are from below
 I am from above; you are of this world
 I am not of this world. ","I told you that you would die in your sins
 for you will die in your sins unless you believe that I am he.\u2019 ","They said to him
 \u2018Who are you?\u2019 Jesus said to them
 \u2018Why do I speak to you at all? ","I have much to say about you and much to condemn; but the one who sent me is true
 and I declare to the world what I have heard from him.\u2019 ","So Jesus said
 \u2018When you have lifted up the Son of Man
 then you will realize that I am he
 and that I do nothing on my own
 but I speak these things as the Father instructed me. ","And the one who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone
 for I always do what is pleasing to him.\u2019 ","Then Jesus said to the Jews who had believed in him
 \u2018If you continue in my word
 you are truly my disciples; ","and you will know the truth
 and the truth will make you free.\u2019 ","Jesus answered them
 \u2018Very truly
 I tell you
 everyone who commits sin is a slave to sin. ","The slave does not have a permanent place in the household; the son has a place there for ever.","So if the Son makes you free
 you will be free indeed. ","I know that you are descendants of Abraham; yet you look for an opportunity to kill me
 because there is no place in you for my word. ","I declare what I have seen in the Father\u2019s presence; as for you
 you should do what you have heard from the Father.\u2019","They answered him
 \u2018Abraham is our father.\u2019 Jesus said to them
 \u2018If you were Abraham\u2019s children
 you would be doing what Abraham did
 ","but now you are trying to kill me
 a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. This is not what Abraham did. ","You are indeed doing what your father does.\u2019 They said to him
 \u2018We are not illegitimate children; we have one father
 God himself.\u2019 ","Jesus said to them
 \u2018If God were your Father
 you would love me
 for I came from God and now I am here. I did not come on my own
 but he sent me. ","Why do you not understand what I say? It is because you cannot accept my word.","You are from your father the devil
 and you choose to do your father\u2019s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth
 because there is no truth in him. When he lies
 he speaks according to his own nature
 for he is a liar and the father of lies. ","But because I tell the truth
 you do not believe me. ","Which of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth
 why do you not believe me? ","Whoever is from God hears the words of God. The reason you do not hear them is that you are not from God.\u2019","Jesus answered
 \u2018I do not have a demon; but I honour my Father
 and you dishonour me. ","Yet I do not seek my own glory; there is one who seeks it and he is the judge.","Very truly
 I tell you
 whoever keeps my word will never see death.\u2019 ","The Jews said to him
 \u2018Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham died
 and so did the prophets; yet you say
 \u201cWhoever keeps my word will never taste death.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u2018If I glorify myself
 my glory is nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me
 he of whom you say
 \u201cHe is our God\u201d
 ","though you do not know him. But I know him; if I were to say that I do not know him
 I would be a liar like you. But I do know him and I keep his word. ","Your ancestor Abraham rejoiced that he would see my day; he saw it and was glad.\u2019","Jesus said to them
 \u2018Very truly
 I tell you
 before Abraham was
 I am.\u2019 ","Jesus answered
 \u2018Neither this man nor his parents sinned; he was born blind so that God\u2019s works might be revealed in him. ","We must work the works of him who sent me while it is day; night is coming when no one can work.","As long as I am in the world
 I am the light of the world.\u2019 ","saying to him
 \u2018Go
 wash in the pool of Siloam\u2019 (which means Sent). Then he went and washed and came back able to see. ","He answered
 \u2018The man called Jesus made mud
 spread it on my eyes
 and said to me
 \u201cGo to Siloam and wash.\u201d Then I went and washed and received my sight.\u2019 ","They said to him
 \u2018Where is he?\u2019 He said
 \u2018I do not know.\u2019","So for the second time they called the man who had been blind
 and they said to him
 \u2018Give glory to God! We know that this man is a sinner.\u2019 ","He answered
 \u2018I do not know whether he is a sinner. One thing I do know
 that though I was blind
 now I see.\u2019 ","They said to him
 \u2018What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?\u2019 ","He answered them
 \u2018I have told you already
 and you would not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also want to become his disciples?\u2019 ","Jesus heard that they had driven him out
 and when he found him
 he said
 \u2018Do you believe in the Son of Man?\u2019 ","Jesus said to him
 \u2018You have seen him
 and the one speaking with you is he.\u2019 ","Jesus said
 \u2018I came into this world for judgement so that those who do not see may see
 and those who do see may become blind.\u2019 ","Jesus said to them
 \u2018If you were blind
 you would not have sin. But now that you say
 \u201cWe see\u201d
 your sin remains.","\u2018Very truly
 I tell you
 anyone who does not enter the sheepfold by the gate but climbs in by another way is a thief and a bandit. ","The one who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep.","The gatekeeper opens the gate for him
 and the sheep hear his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. ","When he has brought out all his own
 he goes ahead of them
 and the sheep follow him because they know his voice. ","They will not follow a stranger
 but they will run from him because they do not know the voice of strangers.\u2019 ","So again Jesus said to them
 \u2018Very truly
 I tell you
 I am the gate for the sheep. ","All who came before me are thieves and bandits; but the sheep did not listen to them.","I am the gate. Whoever enters by me will be saved
 and will come in and go out and find pasture. ","The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life
 and have it abundantly.","\u2018I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.","The hired hand
 who is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep
 sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and runs away\u2014and the wolf snatches them and scatters them. ","The hired hand runs away because a hired hand does not care for the sheep.","I am the good shepherd. I know my own and my own know me
 ","just as the Father knows me and I know the Father. And I lay down my life for the sheep.","I have other sheep that do not belong to this fold. I must bring them also
 and they will listen to my voice. So there will be one flock
 one shepherd. ","For this reason the Father loves me
 because I lay down my life in order to take it up again. ","No one takes it from me
 but I lay it down of my own accord. I have power to lay it down
 and I have power to take it up again. I have received this command from my Father.\u2019","Jesus answered
 \u2018I have told you
 and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father\u2019s name testify to me; ","but you do not believe
 because you do not belong to my sheep. ","My sheep hear my voice. I know them
 and they follow me. ","I give them eternal life
 and they will never perish. No one will snatch them out of my hand. ","What my Father has given me is greater than all else
 and no one can snatch it out of the Father\u2019s hand. ","The Father and I are one.\u2019","Jesus replied
 \u2018I have shown you many good works from the Father. For which of these are you going to stone me?\u2019 ","Jesus answered
 \u2018Is it not written in your law
 \u201cI said
 you are gods\u201d? ","If those to whom the word of God came were called \u201cgods\u201d\u2014and the scripture cannot be annulled\u2014","can you say that the one whom the Father has sanctified and sent into the world is blaspheming because I said
 \u201cI am God\u2019s Son\u201d? ","If I am not doing the works of my Father
 then do not believe me. ","But if I do them
 even though you do not believe me
 believe the works
 so that you may know and understand that the Father is in me and I am in the Father.\u2019 ","But when Jesus heard it
 he said
 \u2018This illness does not lead to death; rather it is for God\u2019s glory
 so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.\u2019 ","Then after this he said to the disciples
 \u2018Let us go to Judea again.\u2019 ","Jesus answered
 \u2018Are there not twelve hours of daylight? Those who walk during the day do not stumble
 because they see the light of this world. ","But those who walk at night stumble
 because the light is not in them.\u2019 ","After saying this
 he told them
 \u2018Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep
 but I am going there to awaken him.\u2019 ","Then Jesus told them plainly
 \u2018Lazarus is dead. ","For your sake I am glad I was not there
 so that you may believe. But let us go to him.\u2019 ","Thomas
 who was called the Twin
 said to his fellow-disciples
 \u2018Let us also go
 that we may die with him.\u2019","Jesus said to her
 \u2018Your brother will rise again.\u2019 ","Jesus said to her
 \u2018I am the resurrection and the life. Those who believe in me
 even though they die
 will live
 ","and everyone who lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?\u2019","She said to him
 \u2018Yes
 Lord
 I believe that you are the Messiah
 the Son of God
 the one coming into the world.\u2019","When Mary came where Jesus was and saw him
 she knelt at his feet and said to him
 \u2018Lord
 if you had been here
 my brother would not have died.\u2019 ","He said
 \u2018Where have you laid him?\u2019 They said to him
 \u2018Lord
 come and see.\u2019 ","Jesus said
 \u2018Take away the stone.\u2019 Martha
 the sister of the dead man
 said to him
 \u2018Lord
 already there is a stench because he has been dead for four days.\u2019 ","Jesus said to her
 \u2018Did I not tell you that if you believed
 you would see the glory of God?\u2019 ","So they took away the stone. And Jesus looked upwards and said
 \u2018Father
 I thank you for having heard me. ","I knew that you always hear me
 but I have said this for the sake of the crowd standing here
 so that they may believe that you sent me.\u2019 ","When he had said this
 he cried with a loud voice
 \u2018Lazarus
 come out!\u2019 ","The dead man came out
 his hands and feet bound with strips of cloth
 and his face wrapped in a cloth. Jesus said to them
 \u2018Unbind him
 and let him go.\u2019","Jesus said
 \u2018Leave her alone. She bought it so that she might keep it for the day of my burial. ","You always have the poor with you
 but you do not always have me.\u2019","So the crowd that had been with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to testify.","The Pharisees then said to one another
 \u2018You see
 you can do nothing. Look
 the world has gone after him!\u2019","They came to Philip
 who was from Bethsaida in Galilee
 and said to him
 \u2018Sir
 we wish to see Jesus.\u2019 ","Jesus answered them
 \u2018The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. ","Very truly
 I tell you
 unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies
 it remains just a single grain; but if it dies
 it bears much fruit. ","Those who love their life lose it
 and those who hate their life in this world will keep it for eternal life. ","Whoever serves me must follow me
 and where I am
 there will my servant be also. Whoever serves me
 the Father will honour.","\u2018Now my soul is troubled. And what should I say\u2014\u201cFather
 save me from this hour\u201d? No
 it is for this reason that I have come to this hour. ","Father
 glorify your name.\u2019 Then a voice came from heaven
 \u2018I have glorified it
 and I will glorify it again.\u2019 ","Jesus answered
 \u2018This voice has come for your sake
 not for mine. ","Now is the judgement of this world; now the ruler of this world will be driven out.","And I
 when I am lifted up from the earth
 will draw all people to myself.\u2019 ","Jesus said to them
 \u2018The light is with you for a little longer. Walk while you have the light
 so that the darkness may not overtake you. If you walk in the darkness
 you do not know where you are going. ","While you have the light
 believe in the light
 so that you may become children of light.\u2019 After Jesus had said this
 he departed and hid from them. ","Then Jesus cried aloud: \u2018Whoever believes in me believes not in me but in him who sent me.","And whoever sees me sees him who sent me.","I have come as light into the world
 so that everyone who believes in me should not remain in the darkness. ","I do not judge anyone who hears my words and does not keep them
 for I came not to judge the world
 but to save the world. ","The one who rejects me and does not receive my word has a judge; on the last day the word that I have spoken will serve as judge
 ","for I have not spoken on my own
 but the Father who sent me has himself given me a commandment about what to say and what to speak. ","And I know that his commandment is eternal life. What I speak
 therefore
 I speak just as the Father has told me.\u2019","Jesus answered
 \u2018You do not know now what I am doing
 but later you will understand.\u2019 ","Peter said to him
 \u2018You will never wash my feet.\u2019 Jesus answered
 \u2018Unless I wash you
 you have no share with me.\u2019 ","Jesus said to him
 \u2018One who has bathed does not need to wash
 except for the feet
 but is entirely clean. And you are clean
 though not all of you.\u2019 ","For he knew who was to betray him; for this reason he said
 \u2018Not all of you are clean.\u2019","After he had washed their feet
 had put on his robe
 and had returned to the table
 he said to them
 \u2018Do you know what I have done to you? ","You call me Teacher and Lord\u2014and you are right
 for that is what I am. ","So if I
 your Lord and Teacher
 have washed your feet
 you also ought to wash one another\u2019s feet. ","For I have set you an example
 that you also should do as I have done to you. ","Very truly
 I tell you
 servants are not greater than their master
 nor are messengers greater than the one who sent them. ","If you know these things
 you are blessed if you do them. ","I am not speaking of all of you; I know whom I have chosen. But it is to fulfil the scripture
 \u201cThe one who ate my bread has lifted his heel against me.\u201d ","I tell you this now
 before it occurs
 so that when it does occur
 you may believe that I am he. ","Very truly
 I tell you
 whoever receives one whom I send receives me; and whoever receives me receives him who sent me.\u2019","After saying this Jesus was troubled in spirit
 and declared
 \u2018Very truly
 I tell you
 one of you will betray me.\u2019 ","Jesus answered
 \u2018It is the one to whom I give this piece of bread when I have dipped it in the dish.\u2019 So when he had dipped the piece of bread
 he gave it to Judas son of Simon Iscariot. ","After he received the piece of bread
 Satan entered into him. Jesus said to him
 \u2018Do quickly what you are going to do.\u2019 ","When he had gone out
 Jesus said
 \u2018Now the Son of Man has been glorified
 and God has been glorified in him. ","If God has been glorified in him
 God will also glorify him in himself and will glorify him at once. ","Little children
 I am with you only a little longer. You will look for me; and as I said to the Jews so now I say to you
 \u201cWhere I am going
 you cannot come.\u201d ","I give you a new commandment
 that you love one another. Just as I have loved you
 you also should love one another. ","By this everyone will know that you are my disciples
 if you have love for one another.\u2019","Simon Peter said to him
 \u2018Lord
 where are you going?\u2019 Jesus answered
 \u2018Where I am going
 you cannot follow me now; but you will follow afterwards.\u2019 ","Jesus answered
 \u2018Will you lay down your life for me? Very truly
 I tell you
 before the cock crows
 you will have denied me three times.","\u2018Do not let your hearts be troubled. Believe in God
 believe also in me. ","In my Father\u2019s house there are many dwelling-places. If it were not so
 would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you? ","And if I go and prepare a place for you
 I will come again and will take you to myself
 so that where I am
 there you may be also. ","And you know the way to the place where I am going.\u2019","Jesus said to him
 \u2018I am the way
 and the truth
 and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. ","If you know me
 you will know my Father also. From now on you do know him and have seen him.\u2019","Jesus said to him
 \u2018Have I been with you all this time
 Philip
 and you still do not know me? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say
 \u201cShow us the Father\u201d? ","Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own; but the Father who dwells in me does his works.","Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; but if you do not
 then believe me because of the works themselves. ","Very truly
 I tell you
 the one who believes in me will also do the works that I do and
 in fact
 will do greater works than these
 because I am going to the Father. ","I will do whatever you ask in my name
 so that the Father may be glorified in the Son. ","If in my name you ask me for anything
 I will do it.","\u2018If you love me
 you will keep my commandments. ","And I will ask the Father
 and he will give you another Advocate
 to be with you for ever. ","This is the Spirit of truth
 whom the world cannot receive
 because it neither sees him nor knows him. You know him
 because he abides with you
 and he will be in you.","\u2018I will not leave you orphaned; I am coming to you.","In a little while the world will no longer see me
 but you will see me; because I live
 you also will live. ","On that day you will know that I am in my Father
 and you in me
 and I in you. ","They who have my commandments and keep them are those who love me; and those who love me will be loved by my Father
 and I will love them and reveal myself to them.\u2019 ","Judas (not Iscariot) said to him
 \u2018Lord
 how is it that you will reveal yourself to us
 and not to the world?\u2019 ","Jesus answered him
 \u2018Those who love me will keep my word
 and my Father will love them
 and we will come to them and make our home with them. ","Whoever does not love me does not keep my words; and the word that you hear is not mine
 but is from the Father who sent me.","\u2018I have said these things to you while I am still with you.","But the Advocate
 the Holy Spirit
 whom the Father will send in my name
 will teach you everything
 and remind you of all that I have said to you. ","Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled
 and do not let them be afraid. ","You heard me say to you
 \u201cI am going away
 and I am coming to you.\u201d If you loved me
 you would rejoice that I am going to the Father
 because the Father is greater than I. ","And now I have told you this before it occurs
 so that when it does occur
 you may believe. ","I will no longer talk much with you
 for the ruler of this world is coming. He has no power over me; ","but I do as the Father has commanded me
 so that the world may know that I love the Father. Rise
 let us be on our way.","\u2018I am the true vine
 and my Father is the vine-grower. ","He removes every branch in me that bears no fruit. Every branch that bears fruit he prunes to make it bear more fruit.","You have already been cleansed by the word that I have spoken to you.","Abide in me as I abide in you. Just as the branch cannot bear fruit by itself unless it abides in the vine
 neither can you unless you abide in me. ","I am the vine
 you are the branches. Those who abide in me and I in them bear much fruit
 because apart from me you can do nothing. ","Whoever does not abide in me is thrown away like a branch and withers; such branches are gathered
 thrown into the fire
 and burned. ","If you abide in me
 and my words abide in you
 ask for whatever you wish
 and it will be done for you. ","My Father is glorified by this
 that you bear much fruit and become my disciples. ","As the Father has loved me
 so I have loved you; abide in my love. ","If you keep my commandments
 you will abide in my love

 and that your joy may be complete.","\u2018This is my commandment
 that you love one another as I have loved you. ","No one has greater love than this
 to lay down one\u2019s life for one\u2019s friends. ","You are my friends if you do what I command you.","I do not call you servants any longer
 because the servant does not know what the master is doing; but I have called you friends

 fruit that will last
 so that the Father will give you whatever you ask him in my name. ","I am giving you these commands so that you may love one another.","\u2018If the world hates you
 be aware that it hated me before it hated you. ","If you belonged to the world
 the world would love you as its own. Because you do not belong to the world
 but I have chosen you out of the world\u2014therefore the world hates you. ","Remember the word that I said to you
 \u201cServants are not greater than their master.\u201d If they persecuted me
 they will persecute you; if they kept my word
 they will keep yours also. ","But they will do all these things to you on account of my name
 because they do not know him who sent me. ","If I had not come and spoken to them
 they would not have sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin. ","Whoever hates me hates my Father also.","If I had not done among them the works that no one else did
 they would not have sin. But now they have seen and hated both me and my Father. ","It was to fulfil the word that is written in their law

 an hour is coming when those who kill you will think that by doing so they are offering worship to God.

 \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d ","But because I have said these things to you
 sorrow has filled your hearts. ","Nevertheless
 I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away

 the Advocate will not come to you; but if I go
 I will send him to you. ","And when he comes
 he will prove the world wrong about sin and righteousness and judgement: ","about sin
 because they do not believe in me; ","about righteousness
 because I am going to the Father and you will see me no longer; ","about judgement
 because the ruler of this world has been condemned.","\u2018I still have many things to say to you
 but you cannot bear them now. ","When the Spirit of truth comes
 he will guide you into all the truth; for he will not speak on his own
 but will speak whatever he hears

 \u2018What does he mean by this \u201ca little while\u201d? We do not know what he is talking about.\u2019 ","Jesus knew that they wanted to ask him

 I tell you
 you will weep and mourn
 but the world will rejoice; you will have pain
 but your pain will turn into joy. ","When a woman is in labour
 she has pain
 because her hour has come. But when her child is born
 she no longer remembers the anguish because of the joy of having brought a human being into the world. ","So you have pain now; but I will see you again

 and no one will take your joy from you. ","On that day you will ask nothing of me. Very truly
 I tell you
 if you ask anything of the Father in my name
 he will give it to you. ","Until now you have not asked for anything in my name. Ask and you will receive
 so that your joy may be complete.","\u2018I have said these things to you in figures of speech. The hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figures

 I am leaving the world and am going to the Father.\u2019","Jesus answered them
 \u2018Do you now believe? ","The hour is coming
 indeed it has come

 glorify me in your own presence with the glory that I had in your presence before the world existed.","\u2018I have made your name known to those whom you gave me from the world. They were yours

 just as I do not belong to the world. ","Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth.","As you have sent me into the world
 so I have sent them into the world. ","And for their sakes I sanctify myself
 so that they also may be sanctified in truth.","\u2018I ask not only on behalf of these
 but also on behalf of those who will believe in me through their word
 ","that they may all be one. As you
 Father
 are in me and I am in you

 I desire that those also

 the world does not know you

 knowing all that was to happen to him
 came forward and asked them
 \u2018For whom are you looking?\u2019 ","They answered
 \u2018Jesus of Nazareth.\u2019 Jesus replied
 \u2018I am he.\u2019 Judas
 who betrayed him
 was standing with them. ","When Jesus said to them
 \u2018I am he\u2019
 they stepped back and fell to the ground. ","Again he asked them
 \u2018For whom are you looking?\u2019 And they said
 \u2018Jesus of Nazareth.\u2019 ","Jesus answered
 \u2018I told you that I am he. So if you are looking for me
 let these men go.\u2019 ","Jesus said to Peter
 \u2018Put your sword back into its sheath. Am I not to drink the cup that the Father has given me?\u2019","The woman said to Peter
 \u2018You are not also one of this man\u2019s disciples
 are you?\u2019 He said
 \u2018I am not.\u2019 ","Jesus answered
 \u2018I have spoken openly to the world; I have always taught in synagogues and in the temple
 where all the Jews come together. I have said nothing in secret. ","Why do you ask me? Ask those who heard what I said to them; they know what I said.\u2019","Jesus answered
 \u2018If I have spoken wrongly
 testify to the wrong. But if I have spoken rightly
 why do you strike me?\u2019 ","Pilate said to them
 \u2018Take him yourselves and judge him according to your law.\u2019 The Jews replied
 \u2018We are not permitted to put anyone to death.\u2019 ","Jesus answered
 \u2018Do you ask this on your own
 or did others tell you about me?\u2019 ","Jesus answered
 \u2018My kingdom is not from this world. If my kingdom were from this world
 my followers would be fighting to keep me from being handed over to the Jews. But as it is
 my kingdom is not from here.\u2019 ","Pilate asked him
 \u2018So you are a king?\u2019 Jesus answered
 \u2018You say that I am a king. For this I was born
 and for this I came into the world
 to testify to the truth. Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice.\u2019 ","Pilate went out again and said to them
 \u2018Look
 I am bringing him out to you to let you know that I find no case against him.\u2019 ","So Jesus came out
 wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them
 \u2018Here is the man!\u2019 ","When the chief priests and the police saw him
 they shouted
 \u2018Crucify him! Crucify him!\u2019 Pilate said to them
 \u2018Take him yourselves and crucify him; I find no case against him.\u2019 ","Jesus answered him
 \u2018You would have no power over me unless it had been given you from above; therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin.\u2019 ","Now it was the day of Preparation for the Passover; and it was about noon. He said to the Jews
 \u2018Here is your King!\u2019 ","When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing beside her
 he said to his mother
 \u2018Woman
 here is your son.\u2019 ","Then he said to the disciple
 \u2018Here is your mother.\u2019 And from that hour the disciple took her into his own home.","After this
 when Jesus knew that all was now finished
 he said (in order to fulfil the scripture)
 \u2018I am thirsty.\u2019 ","When Jesus had received the wine
 he said
 \u2018It is finished.\u2019 Then he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.","So she ran and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple
 the one whom Jesus loved
 and said to them
 \u2018They have taken the Lord out of the tomb
 and we do not know where they have laid him.\u2019 ","They said to her
 \u2018Woman
 why are you weeping?\u2019 She said to them
 \u2018They have taken away my Lord
 and I do not know where they have laid him.\u2019 ","Jesus said to her
 \u2018Woman
 why are you weeping? For whom are you looking?\u2019 Supposing him to be the gardener
 she said to him
 \u2018Sir
 if you have carried him away
 tell me where you have laid him
 and I will take him away.\u2019 ","Jesus said to her
 \u2018Mary!\u2019 She turned and said to him in Hebrew
 \u2018Rabbouni!\u2019 (which means Teacher). ","Jesus said to her
 \u2018Do not hold on to me
 because I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers and say to them
 \u201cI am ascending to my Father and your Father
 to my God and your God.\u201d\u2019 ","When it was evening on that day
 the first day of the week
 and the doors of the house where the disciples had met were locked for fear of the Jews
 Jesus came and stood among them and said
 \u2018Peace be with you.\u2019 ","Jesus said to them again
 \u2018Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me
 so I send you.\u2019 ","When he had said this
 he breathed on them and said to them
 \u2018Receive the Holy Spirit. ","If you forgive the sins of any
 they are forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any
 they are retained.\u2019","So the other disciples told him
 \u2018We have seen the Lord.\u2019 But he said to them
 \u2018Unless I see the mark of the nails in his hands
 and put my finger in the mark of the nails and my hand in his side
 I will not believe.\u2019","A week later his disciples were again in the house
 and Thomas was with them. Although the doors were shut
 Jesus came and stood among them and said
 \u2018Peace be with you.\u2019 ","Then he said to Thomas
 \u2018Put your finger here and see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it in my side. Do not doubt but believe.\u2019 ","Jesus said to him
 \u2018Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have come to believe.\u2019","Jesus said to them
 \u2018Children
 you have no fish
 have you?\u2019 They answered him
 \u2018No.\u2019 ","Jesus said to them
 \u2018Bring some of the fish that you have just caught.\u2019 ","Jesus said to them
 \u2018Come and have breakfast.\u2019 Now none of the disciples dared to ask him
 \u2018Who are you?\u2019 because they knew it was the Lord. ","When they had finished breakfast
 Jesus said to Simon Peter
 \u2018Simon son of John
 do you love me more than these?\u2019 He said to him
 \u2018Yes
 Lord; you know that I love you.\u2019 Jesus said to him
 \u2018Feed my lambs.\u2019 ","A second time he said to him
 \u2018Simon son of John
 do you love me?\u2019 He said to him
 \u2018Yes
 Lord; you know that I love you.\u2019 Jesus said to him
 \u2018Tend my sheep.\u2019 ","He said to him the third time
 \u2018Simon son of John
 do you love me?\u2019 Peter felt hurt because he said to him the third time
 \u2018Do you love me?\u2019 And he said to him
 \u2018Lord
 you know everything; you know that I love you.\u2019 Jesus said to him
 \u2018Feed my sheep. ","Very truly
 I tell you
 when you were younger
 you used to fasten your own belt and to go wherever you wished. But when you grow old
 you will stretch out your hands
 and someone else will fasten a belt around you and take you where you do not wish to go.\u2019 ","(He said this to indicate the kind of death by which he would glorify God.) After this he said to him
 \u2018Follow me.\u2019","Jesus said to him
 \u2018If it is my will that he remain until I come
 what is that to you? Follow me!\u2019 ","So the rumour spread in the community that this disciple would not die. Yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die
 but
 \u2018If it is my will that he remain until I come
 what is that to you?\u2019","\u2018What then?\u2019 they asked. \u2018Are you Elijah?\u2019 \u2018No
 I\u2019m not
\u2019 he replied. \u2018Are you the Prophet?\u2019 \u2018No.\u2019","\u2018Well
 then

\u2019 he replied. So they came
 and saw where he was staying
 and stayed with him that day. It was late in the afternoon.","He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him. \u2018So
\u2019 he said

 like our word \u2018Peter\u2019.)","The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee
 where he found Philip. \u2018Follow me
\u2019 he said to him.","Philip found Nathanael. \u2018We\u2019ve found him!\u2019 he said. \u2018The one Moses wrote about in the law! And the prophets

 from Nazareth!\u2019","\u2018Really?\u2019 replied Nathanael. \u2018Are you telling me that something good can come out of Nazareth?\u2019 \u2018Come and see
\u2019 replied Philip.","Jesus saw Nathanael coming towards him. \u2018Here he comes
\u2019 he said. \u2018Look at him! He\u2019s a real Israelite. Genuine through and through.\u2019","\u2018How did you get to know me?\u2019 asked Nathanael. \u2018Oh
\u2019 replied Jesus
 \u2018I saw you under the fig tree
 before Philip spoke to you.\u2019","\u2018Wait a minute
\u2019 said Jesus. \u2018Are you telling me that you believe just because I told you I saw you under the fig tree? You\u2019ll see a lot more than that!","\u2018In fact
\u2019 he went on
 \u2018I\u2019m telling you the solemn truth. You\u2019ll see heaven opened
 and God\u2019s angels going up and down upon the son of man.\u2019","\u2018Oh
 Mother!\u2019 replied Jesus. \u2018What\u2019s that got do to do with you and me? My time hasn\u2019t come yet.\u2019","\u2018Fill the jars with water
\u2019 said Jesus to the servants. And they filled them
 right up to the brim.","\u2018Now draw some out\u2019
 he said
 \u2018and take it to the chief steward.\u2019 They did so.","\u2018Take these things away!\u2019 he said to the people selling doves. \u2018You mustn\u2019t turn my father\u2019s house into a market!\u2019","\u2018Destroy this Temple
\u2019 replied Jesus
 \u2018and I\u2019ll raise it up in three days.\u2019","\u2018Let me tell you the solemn truth
\u2019 replied Jesus. \u2018Unless someone has been born from above
 they won\u2019t be able to see God\u2019s kingdom.\u2019","\u2018I\u2019m telling you the solemn truth
\u2019 replied Jesus. \u2018Unless someone is born from water and spirit
 they can\u2019t enter God\u2019s kingdom. ","Flesh is born from flesh
 but spirit is born from spirit. ","Don\u2019t be surprised that I said to you
 You must be born from above. ","The wind blows where it wants to
 and you hear the sound it makes; but you don\u2019t know where it\u2019s coming from or where it\u2019s going to. That\u2019s what it\u2019s like with someone who is born from the spirit.\u2019","\u2018Well
 well!\u2019 replied Jesus. \u2018You\u2019re a teacher of Israel
 and yet you don\u2019t know about all this? ","I\u2019m telling you the solemn truth: we\u2019re talking about things we know about. We\u2019re giving evidence about things we\u2019ve seen. But you won\u2019t admit our evidence.","If I told you earthly things and you don\u2019t believe
 how will it be if I tell you heavenly things? Are you going to believe then? ","And nobody has gone up into heaven except the one who came down from heaven
 the son of man.\u2019","\u2018So
 just as Moses lifted up the snake in the desert
 in the same way the son of man must be lifted up
 ","so that everyone who believes in him may share in the life of God\u2019s new age.","This
 you see
 is how much God loved the world: enough to give his only
 special son
 so that everyone who believes in him should not be lost but should share in the life of God\u2019s new age. ","After all
 God didn\u2019t send the son into the world to condemn the world
 but so that the world could be saved by him.","\u2018Anyone who believes in him is not condemned. But anyone who doesn\u2019t believe is condemned already
 because they didn\u2019t believe in the name of God\u2019s only
 special son. ","And this is the condemnation: that light has come into the world
 and people loved darkness rather than light
 because what they were doing was evil. ","For everyone who does evil hates the light; people like that don\u2019t come to the light
 in case their deeds get shown up and reproved. ","But people who do the truth come to the light
 so that it can become clear that what they have done has been done in God.\u2019","They came to John. \u2018Rabbi

 and he set off.","So he asked them what time he had begun to get better. \u2018Yesterday afternoon
 about one o\u2019clock

 the son does too

 just as the father raises the dead and gives them life
 in the same way the son gives life to anyone he chooses.","\u2018The father doesn\u2019t judge anyone
 you see; he has handed over all judgment to the son
 ","so that everyone should honour the son just as they honour the father. Anyone who doesn\u2019t honour the son doesn\u2019t honour the father who sent him.","\u2018I\u2019m telling you the solemn truth: anyone who hears my word
 and believes in the one who sent me
 has the life of God\u2019s coming age. Such a person won\u2019t come into judgment; they will have passed out of death into life. ","I\u2019m telling you the solemn truth: the time is coming\u00a0\u2013 in fact
 it\u2019s here already!\u00a0\u2013 when the dead will hear the voice of God\u2019s son
 and those who hear it will live. ","You see
 just as the father has life in himself
 in the same way he has given the son the privilege of having life in himself. ","He has even given him authority to pass judgment
 because he is the son of man.","\u2018Don\u2019t be surprised at this. The time is coming

 to the resurrection of judgment.\u2019","\u2018I can\u2019t do anything on my own authority
\u2019 Jesus went on. \u2018I judge on the basis of what I hear. And my judgment is just
 because I\u2019m not trying to carry out my own wishes
 but the wishes of the one who sent me.","\u2018If I give evidence about myself
 my evidence isn\u2019t true. ","There is someone else who gives evidence about me
 and I know that the evidence which he brings about me is true. ","You sent messengers to John
 and he gave evidence about the truth. ","Not that I need evidence from human beings; but I\u2019m saying this so that you may be saved.","\u2018John was a burning
 bright lamp
 and you were happy to celebrate in his light for a while. ","But I have greater evidence on my side than that of John. The works which the father has given me to complete\u00a0\u2013 these works
 which I\u2019m doing
 will provide evidence about me

 \u201cThey shall all be taught by God.\u201d Everyone who listens to what comes from the father
 and learns from it comes to me. ","Not that anyone has seen the father except the one who is from God; he has seen the father.\u2019","\u2018I\u2019m telling you the solemn truth
\u2019 Jesus went on. \u2018Anyone who believes in me has the life of God\u2019s coming age. ","I am the bread of life.","Your ancestors in the wilderness ate the manna
 and they died. ","This is the bread which comes down from heaven
 so that people can eat it and not die. ","I am the living bread which came down from heaven. If anyone eats from this bread
 they will live for ever. And the bread which I shall give is my flesh
 given for the life of the world.\u2019","\u2018I\u2019m telling you the solemn truth
\u2019 Jesus replied. \u2018If you don\u2019t eat the flesh of the son of man
 and drink his blood
 you have no life in yourselves. ","Anyone who feasts upon my flesh and drinks my blood has the life of God\u2019s coming age
 and I will raise them up on the last day. ","My flesh is true food
 you see
 and my blood is true drink. ","Anyone who eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me
 and I remain in them. ","Just as the living father sent me
 and I live because of the father
 so the one who eats me will live because of me. ","This is the bread which came down from heaven; it isn\u2019t like the bread which the ancestors ate
 and died. The one who eats this bread will share the life of God\u2019s new age.\u2019","Jesus knew in himself that his disciples were grumbling about what he\u2019d said. \u2018Does this put you off?\u2019 he said.","\u2018What if you were to see the son of man ascending to where he was before?","It\u2019s the spirit that gives life; the flesh is no help. The words that I have spoken to you\u00a0\u2013 they are spirit
 they are life. ","But there are some of you who don\u2019t believe.\u2019 Jesus knew from the beginning
 you see
 those who didn\u2019t believe
 and the one who was going to betray him.","\u2018That\u2019s why I said\u2019
 he went on
 \u2018that no one can come to me unless it is given to them by the father.\u2019","Jesus turned to the Twelve. \u2018You don\u2019t want to go away too
 do you?\u2019 he asked.","\u2018Well
\u2019 replied Jesus
 \u2018I chose you twelve
 didn\u2019t I? And one of you is an accuser!\u2019","So Jesus\u2019 brothers approached him. \u2018Leave this place\u2019
 they said
 \u2018and go to Judaea! Then your disciples will see the works you\u2019re doing. ","\u2018My time isn\u2019t here yet
\u2019 replied Jesus
 \u2018but your time is always here. ","The world can\u2019t hate you
 but it hates me

\u2019 replied Jesus. \u2018It comes from the one who sent me! ","If anyone wants to do what God wants
 they will know whether this teaching is from God
 or whether I\u2019m just speaking on my own account. ","Anyone who speaks on his own behalf is trying to establish his own reputation. But if what he\u2019s interested in is the reputation of the one who sent him

 didn\u2019t he?\u2019 Jesus continued. \u2018But none of you obeys the law. Why are you wanting to kill me?\u2019","\u2018Look here
\u2019 replied Jesus. \u2018I did one single thing
 and you are all amazed. ","Moses commanded you to practise circumcision (not that it starts with Moses
 of course; it comes from the patriarchs)
 and you circumcise a man on the sabbath. ","Well
 then
 if a man receives circumcision on the sabbath
 so that the law of Moses may not be broken
 how can you be angry with me if I make an entire man healthy on the sabbath? ","Don\u2019t judge by appearances! Judge with proper and right judgment!\u2019","Some Jerusalem residents commented
 \u2018Isn\u2019t this the man they\u2019re trying to kill? ","As Jesus was teaching in the Temple
 he shouted out

 among the Greeks
 is he
 and teach the Greeks? ","On the last day of the festival
 the great final celebration
 Jesus stood up and shouted out
 \u2018If anybody\u2019s thirsty
 they should come to me and have a drink! ","Anyone who believes in me will have rivers of living water flowing out of their heart
 just like the Bible says!\u2019","He said this about the spirit
 which people who believed in him were to receive. The spirit wasn\u2019t available yet

\u2019 they said to him. \u2018This woman was caught in the very act of adultery. ","When they went on pressing the question
 he got up and said to them
 \u2018Whichever of you is without sin should throw the first stone at her.\u2019","Jesus looked up. \u2018Where are they

\u2019 replied Jesus to them
 \u2018my evidence is true

 my judgment is true
 because I\u2019m not a lone voice; I have on my side the father who sent me. ","It is written in your law that the evidence of two people is true.","I\u2019m giving evidence about myself

 \u2018and you don\u2019t know my father! If you had known me
 you would have known my father as well.\u2019","So Jesus spoke to them once more. \u2018I am going away

 that\u2019s what will happen to you if you don\u2019t believe that I am the one.\u2019","\u2018Who are you?\u2019 they asked. \u2018What I\u2019ve been telling you from the beginning
\u2019 replied Jesus. ","\u2018There are plenty of things I could say about you
 yes

The father who sent me gave me his own command about what I should say and speak.","And I know that his command is the life of the coming age. What I speak

 then: if I
 as your master and teacher
 washed your feet just now
 you should wash each other\u2019s feet. ","I\u2019ve given you a pattern
 so that you can do things in the same way that I did to you.","\u2018I\u2019m telling you the solemn truth

 God\u2019s blessing on you if you do them.","\u2018I\u2019m not talking about all of you

 and gave it to Judas
 son of Simon Iscariot.","After the bread
 the satan entered into him. \u2018Do it quickly

 I will do it
 so that the father may be glorified in the son. ","If you ask anything in my name
 I will do it.","\u2018If you love me

 and gave up his spirit.","So she ran off
 and went to Simon Peter
 and to the other disciple
 the one Jesus loved. \u2018They\u2019ve taken the master out of the tomb!\u2019 she said. \u2018We don\u2019t know where they\u2019ve put him!\u2019","\u2018Woman

\u2019 Jesus said to her
 \u2018why are you crying? Who are you looking for?\u2019 She guessed he must be the gardener. \u2018Sir

 the first day of the week
 the doors were shut where the disciples were

 they are forgiven. If you retain anyone\u2019s sins
 they are retained.\u2019","So the other disciples spoke to him. \u2018We\u2019ve seen the master!\u2019 they said. \u2018Unless I see the mark of the nails in his hands

 \u2018and put my finger into the nail-marks
 and put my hand into his side \u2013 I\u2019m not going to believe!\u2019","A week later the disciples were again in the house
 and Thomas was with them. The doors were shut. Jesus came and stood in the middle of them. \u2018Peace be with you!\u2019 he said.","Then he addressed Thomas. \u2018Bring your finger here\u2019

\u2019 said Jesus to them. None of the disciples dared ask him

 Jesus spoke to Simon Peter. \u2018Simon
 son of John
\u2019 he said

 Master
\u2019 he said. \u2018You know I\u2019m your friend.\u2019 \u2018Well

 and someone else will dress you up and take you where you don\u2019t want to go.\u2019","He said this to indicate the sort of death by which Peter would bring God glory. And when he had said this
 he added
 \u2018Follow me!\u2019","\u2018If it\u2019s my intention\u2019
 replied Jesus
 \u2018that he should remain here until I come
 what\u2019s that got to do with you? You must follow me!\u2019","So the rumour went around the Christian family that this disciple wouldn\u2019t die. But Jesus didn\u2019t say he wouldn\u2019t die. What he said
 rather
 was this: \u2018If it\u2019s my intention that he should remain here until I come
 what\u2019s that got to do with you?\u2019","And they asked him
 \u201cWhat then? Are you Elijah?\u201d And he said

 \u201cNo.\u201d","Then they said to him
 \u201cWho are you

 \u201cCome

 who is in Heaven.","\u201cAnd as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness
 so must the Son of Man be lifted up;","\u201cthat whoever believes in Him
 should not perish
 but have eternal life.","\u201cFor God so loves the world
 that He has given His only begotten Son; that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.","\u201cFor God did not send his Son into the world that He should condemn the world
 but that the world
 through Him
 might be saved.","\u201cThe one who believes in Him is not condemned. But the one who does not believe
 is condemned already
 because he has not believed in the Name of the only begotten Son of God.","\u201cAnd this is the judgment: that the light came into the world
 and men loved darkness rather than the light
 because their deeds were evil.","\u201cFor everyone who does evil hates the light
 and does not come to the light
 lest his deeds should be exposed.","\u201cBut the one who practices truth comes to the light
 that his works done according to God might be made visible.\u201d","And they came to John

 receives reward
 and gathers fruit to life eternal; that both the one who sows and the one who reaps might rejoice together.","\u201cFor herein is the true saying: that one sows and another reaps.","\u201cI sent you to reap that for which you have not labored. Other men labored
 and you have entered into their labors.\u201d","And they said to the woman

 and I work.\u201d","Then Jesus answered
 and said to them
 \u201cTruly
 truly I say to you. The Son can do nothing of Himself
 except that He sees the Father do. For whatever things He does
 the same things the Son also does in like manner.","\u201cFor the Father loves the Son
 and shows Him all things
 whatever He Himself does. And He will show Him greater works than these
 that you may marvel.","\u201cFor just as the Father raises up the dead
 and quickens them
 so the Son quickens whom He will.","\u201cFor the Father judges no one
 but has committed all judgment to the Son
","\u201cthat all should honor the Son as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son
 the same does not honor the Father Who has sent Him.","\u201cTruly
 truly I say to you
 the one who hears My word

 but has passed from death to life.","\u201cTruly
 truly I say to you
 the hour shall come
 and now is
 when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God. And those who hear it shall live.","\u201cFor as the Father has life in Himself
 so likewise has He given to the Son
 to have life in Himself.","\u201cAnd has also given Him power to execute judgment
 in that He is the Son of man.","\u201cDo not marvel at this. For the hour shall come in which all who are in the graves shall hear His voice.","\u201cAnd those who have done good shall come forth to the resurrection of life; but those who have done evil
 to the resurrection of judgment.","\u201cI can do nothing of My own Self. As I hear
 I judge. And My judgment is just
 because I seek not My own will
 but the will of the Father Who has sent Me.","\u201cIf I should bear witness of Myself
 My witness is not true.","\u201cThere is Another that bears witness of Me. And I know that the witness which He bears of Me is true.","\u201cYou sent to John
 and he bore witness to the truth.","\u201cBut I do not receive the testimony of man. Nevertheless
 these things I say that you might be saved.","\u201cHe was a burning and shining lamp. And you were
 for a season
 willing to rejoice in his light.","\u201cBut I have greater witness than the witness of John. For the works which the Father has given Me to finish (the same works that I do) bear witness of Me
 that the Father sent Me.","\u201cAnd the Father himself
 Who has sent Me
 bears witness of Me. You have not heard His voice at any time
 nor have you seen His shape.","\u201cAnd His word you do not have abiding in you. For Whom He has sent
 Him you did not believe.","\u201cYou search the Scriptures. For in them you think to have eternal life. And they are they which testify of Me.","\u201cBut you will not come to Me
 that you might have life.","\u201cI do not receive the praise of men.","\u201cBut I know you
 that you do not have the love of God in you.","\u201cI have come in My Father\u2019s Name
 and you do not receive Me. If another shall come in his own name
 you will receive him.","How can you believe
 when you receive honor one from one another
 and do not seek the honor that comes from God alone?","\u201cDo not think that I will accuse you to My Father. There is one who accuses you - Moses
 in whom you trust.","\u201cFor had you believed Moses you would have believed Me. For he wrote of Me.","\u201cBut if you do not believe his writings
 how shall you believe My words?\u201d","Then Jesus lifted up His eyes. And seeing that a great multitude came to Him
 he said to Philip

 \u201cMake the men sit down. (Now there was much grass in that place.) Then the men sat down
 about five thousand in number.","And when they were satisfied

 and believes in Him

 so that anyone who eats of it should not die.","\u201cI am the living bread which came down from Heaven. If anyone eats of this bread
 he shall live forever. And the bread that I will give is My flesh
 which I will give for the life of the world.\u201d","Then Jesus said to them
 \u201cTruly
 truly I say to you

 and drink His blood
 you have no life in you.","\u201cWhoever eats My flesh
 and drinks My blood
 has eternal life. And I will raise him up at the last day.","\u201cFor My flesh is true food
 and My blood is true drink.","\u201cthe one who eats My flesh
 and drinks My blood
 dwells in Me
 and I in him.","\u201cAs the living Father has sent Me
 so I live by the Father. And the one who feeds on Me
 shall also live because of Me.","\u201cThis is the bread which came down from Heaven; not as your fathers have eaten Manna and are dead. The one who eats of this bread
 shall live forever.\u201d","But Jesus
 knowing in Himself that His disciples grumbled at this
 said to them
 \u201cDoes this offend you?","\u201cWhat if
 then
 you should see the Son of Man ascend up where He was before?","\u201cIt is the Spirit that quickens. The flesh profits nothing. The words that I speak to you are Spirit and life.","\u201cBut there are some of you who do not believe.\u201d (For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe

 judge righteous judgment.\u201d","Then some of them of Jerusalem said

 on the last day (the great day) of the feast
 Jesus stood and cried

 let him come to Me and drink.","\u201cThe one who believes in Me
 as says the Scripture
 \u2018Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water\u2019.\u201d","(He spoke this about the Spirit

 I do judge
 My judgment is true. For I am not alone
 but I and the Father who sent Me.","\u201cAnd it is also written in your Law that the testimony of two men is true.","\u201cI am one who bears witness of Myself. And the Father
 who sent Me
 bears witness of Me.\u201d","Then they said to Him
 \u201cWhere is this Father of yours?\u201d Jesus answered
 \u201cYou know neither Me nor My Father. If you had known Me
 you would have known My Father also.","Then Jesus said again to them
 \u201cI go My way. And you shall seek Me and shall die in your sins. Where I go
 you cannot come.\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cYou are from beneath. I am from above. You are of this world. I am not of this world.","\u201cTherefore I said to you that you shall die in your sins. For unless you believe that I am He
 you shall die in your sins.\u201d","Then they said to Him
 \u201cWho are you?\u201d And Jesus said to them
 \u201cStill the same that I said to you from the beginning.","\u201cI have many things to say and to judge concerning you. But the One who sent Me is true. And the things that I have heard from Him
 those I speak to the world.\u201d","Then Jesus said to them
 \u201cWhen you have lifted up the Son of Man
 then you shall know that I am He
 and that I do nothing of Myself. But as My Father has taught Me
 I spoke these things.","\u201cFor He who sent Me is with Me. The Father has not left Me alone
 because I always do those things that please Him.\u201d","Then Jesus said to the Jews who believed in Him
 \u201cIf you continue in My word
 you are truly My disciples.","\u201cAnd you shall know the truth. And the truth shall make you free.\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cTruly
 truly I say to you that whoever commits sin is the servant of sin.","\u201cAnd the servant does not abide in the house forever. But the Son abides forever.","\u201cIf
 therefore
 the Son shall make you free
 you shall be free indeed.","\u201cI know that you are Abraham\u2019s seed. But you seek to kill Me because My word has no place in you.","\u201cI speak that which I have seen with My Father. And you do that which you have seen with your father.\u201d","They answered
 and said to Him
 \u201cAbraham is our father.\u201d Jesus said to them
 \u201cIf you were Abraham\u2019s children
 you would do the works of Abraham.","\u201cBut now you seek to kill Me
 a man who has told you the truth
 which I have heard from God. Abraham did not do this.","\u201cYou do the works of your father.\u201d Then they said to Him
 \u201cWe are not born of fornication. We have one Father
 who is God.\u201d","Therefore Jesus said to them
 \u201cIf God were your Father
 then you would love Me. For I proceeded forth and came from God. I did not even come of Myself
 but He sent Me.","\u201cWhy do you not understand My talk? Because you cannot hear My word.","\u201cYou are of your father
 the devil. And you will do the lusts of your father. He has been a murderer from the beginning
 and did not stand in the truth
 because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie
 then he speaks of his own. For he is a liar and the father thereof.","\u201cAnd because I tell you the truth
 you do not believe Me.","\u201cWhich of you can rebuke Me of sin? And if I say the truth
 why do you not believe Me?","\u201cThe one who is of God hears God\u2019s words. You
 therefore
 do not hear them
 because you are not of God.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cI have no devil. But I honor My Father. And you have dishonored Me.","\u201cAnd I do not seek My own praise. But there is One who seeks it
 and judges.","\u201cTruly
 truly I say to you
 \u201cIf anyone keeps My word
 he shall never see death.\u201d","Then the Jews said to Him
 \u201cNow we know that You have a devil. Abraham is dead
 and the Prophets
 and You say
 \u2018If anyone keeps My word
 he shall never taste of death.","Jesus answered
 \u201cIf I honor Myself
 My honor is worth nothing. It is My Father Who honors Me; the One you say is your God.","\u201cYet you have not known Him. But I know Him. And if I should say I do not know Him
 I would be a liar
 like you. But I know Him and keep His word.","\u201cYour father
 Abraham
 rejoiced to see My day. And he saw it and was glad.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cTruly
 truly I say to you: Before Abraham was
 I am.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cNeither this man nor his parents have sinned. But this is so that the works of God would be shown in him.","\u201cI must work the works of the One who sent Me
 while it is day. The night comes
 when no one can work.","\u201cAs long as I am in the world
 I am the light of the world.\u201d","And He said to him
 \u201cGo. Wash in the pool of Siloam (which is by interpretation
 Sent).\u201d Therefore
 he went and washed
 and came back seeing.","He answered
 and said
 \u201cThe Man who is called \u2018Jesus\u2019 made clay and anointed my eyes and said to me
 \u2018Go to the pool of Siloam and wash\u2019. So
 I went and washed
 and received sight.\u201d","Then they said to him
 \u201cWhere is he?\u201d He said
 \u201cI cannot tell.\u201d","Then again they called the man who had been blind
 and said to him
 \u201cGive glory to God. We know that this Man is a sinner.\u201d","Then he answered
 and said
 \u201cWhether He is a sinner or not
 I cannot tell. One thing I know: that I was blind
 and now I see!\u201d","Then they said to him again
 \u201cWhat did He do to you? How did He open your eyes?\u201d","He answered them
 \u201cI have told you already
 and you have not heard it. Why would you hear it again? Do you also wish to be His disciples?","Jesus heard that they had cast him out. And when He had found him
 He said to him
 \u201cDo you believe in the Son of God?\u201d","And Jesus said to him
 \u201cYou have both seen Him
 and it is He who is talking with you.\u201d","And Jesus said
 \u201cFor judgment I have come into this world
 so that those who do not see
 might see; and that those who see
 might be made blind.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cIf you were blind
 you would have no sin. But now you say
 \u2018We see.\u2019 Therefore
 your sin remains.","\u201cTruly
 truly I say to you
 the one who does not enter in by the door into the sheepfold
 but climbs up another way
 he is a thief and a robber.","\u201cBut the one who goes in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.","\u201cTo him the doorkeeper opens. And the sheep hear his voice. And he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.","\u201cAnd when he has sent forth his own sheep
 he goes before them. And the sheep follow him. For they know his voice.","\u201cAnd they will not follow a stranger. But they flee from him. For they do not know the voice of strangers.\u201d","Then Jesus said to them again
 \u201cTruly
 truly I say to you
 I am that Door of the sheep.","\u201cAll that ever came before Me are thieves and robbers. But the sheep did not hear them.","\u201cI am that Door. If anyone enters in by Me
 he shall be saved
 and shall go in
 and go out
 and find pasture.","\u201cThe thief comes not
 if not to steal
 and to kill
 and to destroy. I have come that they might have life and have it in abundance.","\u201cI am the Good Shepherd. The Good Shepherd gives His life for His sheep.","\u201cBut the hired servant (who is not the shepherd
 nor are the sheep his own) sees the wolf coming and he leaves the sheep and flees. And the wolf catches them and scatters the sheep.","\u201cSo the hired servant flees because he is a hired servant and does not care for the sheep.","\u201cI am the Good Shepherd
 and know My own
 and am known by My own.","\u201cAs the Father knows Me
 so I know the Father. And I lay down My life for the sheep.","\u201cI have other sheep also
 which are not of this fold. I must also bring them. And they shall hear My voice. And there shall be one sheepfold
 with one Shepherd.","\u201cTherefore My Father loves Me
 because I lay down My life
 that I might take it again.","\u201cNo one takes it from Me. But I lay it down on My own. I have authority to lay it down and have authority to take it again. I have received this commandment from My Father.\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cI told you
 and you did not believe it. The works that I do in My Father\u2019s Name
 they bear witness of Me.","\u201cBut you did not believe it. For you are not of My sheep
 as I said to you.","\u201cMy sheep hear My voice
 and I know them
 and they follow Me.","\u201cAnd I give them eternal life. And they shall never perish
 nor shall anyone snatch them out of My hand.","\u201cMy Father
 Who gave them to Me
 is greater than all. And no one is able to snatch them out of My Father\u2019s hand.","\u201cI and My Father are One.\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cI have shown you many good works from My Father. For which of these works do you stone Me?\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cIs it not written in your Law
 \u2018I said
 you are gods\u2019?","\u201cIf he called them gods (to whom the word of God has come) and the Scripture cannot be broken
","do you say of Him Whom the Father has sanctified and sent into the world
 \u2018You blaspheme\u2019
 because I said
 \u2018I am the Son of God\u2019?","\u201cIf I do not do the works of My Father
 do not believe Me.","\u201cBut if I do
 then even though you do not believe Me
 believe the works; so that you may know and believe that the Father is in Me
 and I in Him.\u201d","When Jesus heard it
 He said
 \u201cThis sickness does not end in death
 but is for the glory of God
 so that the Son of God might be glorified by it.\u201d","Then after that
 He said to His disciples
 \u201cLet us go into Judea again.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cAre there not twelve hours in the day? If someone walks in the day
 he does not stumble
 because he sees the light of this world.","\u201cBut if someone walks in the night
 he stumbles
 because there is no light in him.\u201d","He spoke these things. And afterward
 He said to them
 \u201cOur friend Lazarus sleeps. But I go to wake him up.\u201d","Then Jesus said to them plainly
 \u201cLazarus is dead.","\u201cAnd I am glad
 for your sakes
 that I was not there
 so that you may believe. But let us go to him.\u201d","Then said Thomas (who is called Didymus) to his fellow disciples
 \u201cLet us also go
 that we may die with Him.\u201d","Jesus said to her
 \u201cYour brother shall rise again.\u201d","Jesus said to her
 \u201cI am the Resurrection and the Life. Whoever believes in Me
 though he were dead
 yet shall he live.","\u201cAnd whoever lives
 and believes in Me
 shall never die. Do you believe this?\u201d","She said to Him
 \u201cYes
 Lord. I believe that You are the Christ
 the Son of God
 the One coming into the world.\u201d","Then
 when Mary had come to where Jesus was
 and saw Him
 she fell down at His feet
 saying to Him
 \u201cLord
 if You had been here
 my brother would not have died.\u201d","and said
 \u201cWhere have you laid him?\u201d They said to Him
 \u201cLord
 come and see.\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cTake away the stone.\u201d Martha
 the sister of him who was dead
 said to Him
 \u201cLord
 he stinks already. For it has been four days.\u201d","Jesus said to her
 \u201cDid I not say to you that if you believed
 you would see the glory of God?\u201d","Then they took away the stone where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up His eyes
 and said
 \u201cFather
 I thank You
 because You have heard Me.","\u201cI know that You always hear Me. But I said it because of the people who stand by
 so that they may believe that You have sent Me.\u201d","And having spoken these things
 He cried with a loud voice
 \u201cLazarus! Come forth!\u201d","Then
 the one who was dead came forth
 bound hand and foot with bandages. And his face was bound with a handkerchief. Jesus said to them
 \u201cUnbind him! And let him go!\u201d","Then Jesus said
 \u201cLet her alone. She kept it for the day of My burying.","\u201cFor the poor you have with you always. But Me you shall not have always.\u201d","Therefore
 the people who were with Him bore witness that He called Lazarus out of the grave and raised him from the dead.","And the Pharisees said among themselves
 \u201cDo you see how nothing is better? Behold
 the world goes after Him.\u201d","And they came to Philip
 who was of Bethsaida in Galilee
 and asked him
 saying
 \u201cSir
 we would like to see Jesus.\u201d","And Jesus answered them
 saying
 \u201cThe hour has come that the Son of Man must be glorified.","\u201cTruly
 truly I say to you
 unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies
 it remains alone. But if it dies
 it brings forth much fruit.","\u201cThe one who loves his life
 shall lose it. And the one who hates his life in this world
 shall keep it to life eternal.","\u201cIf anyone serves Me
 let him follow Me. For where I am
 there My servant shall be. And if anyone serves Me
 My father will honor him.","Now My soul is troubled. And what shall I say? \u2018Father
 save Me from this hour\u2019? But
 for this I came to this hour.","\u201cFather
 glorify Your Name.\u201d Then
 there came a Voice from Heaven
 \u201cI have both glorified it and will glorify it again.\u201d","Jesus answered
 and said
 \u201cThis Voice did not come because of Me
 but for your sakes.","\u201cNow is the judgment of this world. Now shall the prince of this world be cast out.","\u201cAnd I
 if I am lifted up from the earth
 will draw all to Myself.","Then Jesus said to them
 \u201cThe Light is with you for a little while longer. Walk while you have the Light
 lest the darkness come upon you. For one who walks in the dark
 does not know where he goes.","\u201cWhile you have the Light
 believe in the Light
 that you may be the children of the Light.\u201d These things Jesus spoke. And having departed
 He hid Himself from them.","And Jesus cried
 and said
 \u201cWhoever believes in Me
 believes not in Me
 but in Him who sent Me!","\u201cAnd whoever sees Me
 sees Him who sent Me!","\u201cI have come
 a Light into the world
 so that everyone who believes in Me would not stay in darkness.","\u201cAnd if anyone hears My words
 and does not believe
 I do not judge him. For I did not come to judge the world
 but to save the world.","\u201cWhoever refuses Me
 and does not receive My words
 has One Who judges him - the Word that I have spoken. It shall judge him on the last day.","\u201cFor I have not spoken of Myself
 but the Father Who sent Me. He gave Me a commandment
 what I should say and what I should speak.","\u201cAnd I know that His commandment is life everlasting. Therefore
 the things that I speak
 I speak just as the Father said to Me.\u201d","Jesus answered and said to him
 \u201cWhat I do
 you do not know now. But you shall know it hereafter.\u201d","Peter said to Him
 \u201cYou shall never wash my feet.\u201d Jesus answered him
 \u201cIf I do not wash you
 you shall have no part with Me.\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cHe who is washed
 needs only to wash his feet
 but is wholly clean. And you are clean
 but not all.\u201d","For He knew who would betray Him. Therefore
 He said
 \u2018You are not all clean\u2019.","So
 after He had washed their feet and had taken His garments and had sat down again
 He said to them
 \u201cDo you know what I have done to you?","\u201cYou call Me Master
 and Lord. And you say well. For so I am.","\u201cIf I
 then
 your Lord and Master
 has washed your feet
 you also ought to wash one another\u2019s feet.","\u201cFor I have given you an example
 so that you should do just as I have done to you.","\u201cTruly
 truly I say to you
 the servant is not greater than his master
 nor the messenger greater than the one who sent him.","\u201cIf you know these things
 blessed are you if you do them.","\u201cI do not speak of you all. I know whom I have chosen. But it is so that the Scripture might be fulfilled
 \u2018He who eats bread with Me has lifted up his heel against Me.\u2019","\u201cFrom now on I tell you before it comes
 so that when it has happened
 you might believe that I am He.","\u201cTruly
 truly I say to you
 anyone who receives whom I shall send
 receives Me; and anyone who receives Me
 receives Him Who sent Me.\u201d","When Jesus had said these things
 He was troubled in Spirit
 and testified
 and said
 \u201cTruly
 truly I say to you
 that one of you shall betray Me.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cIt is him to whom I shall give a morsel
 when I have dipped it.\u201d And He wet a morsel of bread
 and gave it to Judas Iscariot
 Simon\u2019s son.","And after the morsel
 Satan entered into him. Then Jesus said to him
 \u201cThat you do
 do quickly.\u201d","When he had gone out

 \u201cNow is the Son of Man glorified
 and God is glorified in Him.","\u201cIf God is glorified in Him
 God shall also glorify Him in Himself
 and shall immediately glorify Him.","\u201cLittle children
 I am still with you a little while longer. You shall seek Me

 \u2018Where I go
 you cannot come\u2019

 that you love one another. Just as I have loved you
 you also love one another.","\u201cBy this shall all know that you are My disciples - if you have love one to another.\u201d","Simon Peter said to Him
 \u201cLord
 where are You going?\u201d Jesus answered him
 \u201cWhere I go you cannot follow Me now. But you shall follow Me afterward.\u201d","Jesus answered him

 the cock shall not crow till you have denied Me three times.\u201d","\u201cLet not your heart be troubled. You believe in God
 believe also in Me.","\u201cIn My Father\u2019s house are many dwelling places. If it were not so
 I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.","\u201cAnd if I go to prepare a place for you
 I will come again
 and receive you to Myself; that where I am
 there may you be also.","\u201cAnd where I go
 you know; and the way you know.\u201d","Jesus said to him

 and the Truth
 and the Life. No one comes to the Father

 you would have known My Father also. And henceforth
 you know Him
 and have seen Him.\u201d","Jesus said to him

 has seen the Father. How then can you say
 \u2018Show us the Father\u2019?\u201d","\u201cDo you not believe that I am in the Father
 and the Father is in Me? The words that I speak to you
 I speak not of Myself. But the Father who dwells in Me
 He does the works.","\u201cBelieve Me
 that I am in the Father
 and the Father is in Me. At the least
 believe Me for the very works\u2019 sake.","\u201cTruly
 truly I say to you
 whoever believes in Me
 the works that I do
 he shall do also

 that will I do; so that the Father may be glorified in the Son.","\u201cIf you shall ask anything in My Name
 I will do it.","\u201cIf you love Me

 so that you love one another.","\u201cIf the world hates you

 I will send Him to you.","\u201cAnd when He comes
 He will convict the world concerning sin

 He will lead you into all truth. For He shall not speak from Himself. But whatever He shall hear
 He shall speak. And He will show you the things to come.","\u201cHe shall glorify Me. For He shall receive that which is Mine and shall show it to you.","\u201cAll things that the Father has
 are Mine. Therefore
 I said that He shall take that which is Mine
 and show it to you.","\u201cA little while
 and you shall not see Me. And again
 a little while

 and you shall not see Me. And again
 a little while

 and
 \u2018For I go to the Father\u2019?\u201d","So they said
 \u201cWhat is this that He says

 truly I say to you
 that you shall weep and lament. And the world shall rejoice. And you shall grieve. But your grief shall be turned to joy.","\u201cA woman

 has pain because her hour has come. But as soon as she delivers the child
 she remembers the anguish no more

 He will give it to you.","\u201cUntil now
 you have asked nothing in My Name. Ask
 and you shall receive; so that your joy may be full.","\u201cThese things I have spoken to you in parables. But the time will come when I shall speak to you in parables no more. But I shall report to you plainly concerning the Father.","On that day
 you shall ask in My Name. And I do not say to you that I will pray to the Father for you.","\u201cFor the Father Himself loves you because you have loved Me and have believed that I came out from God.","\u201cI came out from the Father and have come into the world. Again

 so that in Me you might have peace. In the world you shall have tribulation. But be of good courage. I have overcome the world.\u201d","Jesus spoke these things. And having lifted up his eyes to Heaven

 knowing all things that would come to Him

 \u201cDo you say that of yourself

 \u201cMy Kingdom is not of this world. If My Kingdom were of this world
 My servants would surely fight
 so that I might not be delivered to the Jews. But now
 My Kingdom is not from here.\u201d","Then Pilate said to Him
 \u201cAre You a King
 then?\u201d Jesus answered
 \u201cYou say that I am a King. For this reason
 I am born. And for this reason
 I came into the world; that I should bear witness to the Truth. Everyone that is of the Truth
 hears My voice.\u201d","Then Pilate went forth again

 \u201cPeace to you.\u201d","Then Jesus said to them again
 \u201cPeace to you. As My Father sent Me

 again His disciples were within and Thomas with them. Then Jesus came (when the doors were shut) and stood in their midst

 He said to him
 \u201cFollow Me.\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cIf I wish him to remain until I come
 what is that to you? You follow Me.\u201d","Then the word went out among the brothers that this disciple would not die. Yet

 \u201cWhat then? Are you Eli\u2032jah?\u201d He said

 \u201cNo.\u201d ","They said to him then
 \u201cWho are you? Let us have an answer for those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?\u201d ","He said
 \u201cI am the voice of one crying in the wilderness

 the Son of man. ","And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness
 so must the Son of man be lifted up
 ","that whoever believes in him may have eternal life.\u201d","For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son
 that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. ","For God sent the Son into the world
 not to condemn the world
 but that the world might be saved through him. ","He who believes in him is not condemned; he who does not believe is condemned already
 because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God. ","And this is the judgment
 that the light has come into the world
 and men loved darkness rather than light

 and does not come to the light
 lest his deeds should be exposed. ","But he who does what is true comes to the light

 \u201cGo; your son will live.\u201d The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and went his way. ","So he asked them the hour when he began to mend

 \u201cTruly
 truly
 I say to you
 the Son can do nothing of his own accord
 but only what he sees the Father doing; for whatever he does
 that the Son does likewise. ","For the Father loves the Son
 and shows him all that he himself is doing; and greater works than these will he show him
 that you may marvel. ","For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life
 so also the Son gives life to whom he will. ","The Father judges no one
 but has given all judgment to the Son
 ","that all may honor the Son
 even as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him. ","Truly
 truly
 I say to you
 he who hears my word and believes him who sent me
 has eternal life; he does not come into judgment
 but has passed from death to life.","\u201cTruly
 truly
 I say to you
 the hour is coming
 and now is
 when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God
 and those who hear will live. ","For as the Father has life in himself
 so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself
 ","and has given him authority to execute judgment
 because he is the Son of man. ","Do not marvel at this; for the hour is coming when all who are in the tombs will hear his voice","and come forth
 those who have done good
 to the resurrection of life
 and those who have done evil
 to the resurrection of judgment.","\u201cI can do nothing on my own authority; as I hear
 I judge; and my judgment is just
 because I seek not my own will but the will of him who sent me. ","If I bear witness to myself
 my testimony is not true; ","there is another who bears witness to me
 and I know that the testimony which he bears to me is true. ","You sent to John
 and he has borne witness to the truth. ","Not that the testimony which I receive is from man; but I say this that you may be saved.","He was a burning and shining lamp
 and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light. ","But the testimony which I have is greater than that of John; for the works which the Father has granted me to accomplish
 these very works which I am doing
 bear me witness that the Father has sent me. ","And the Father who sent me has himself borne witness to me. His voice you have never heard
 his form you have never seen; ","and you do not have his word abiding in you
 for you do not believe him whom he has sent. ","You search the scriptures
 because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is they that bear witness to me; ","yet you refuse to come to me that you may have life.","I do not receive glory from men.","But I know that you have not the love of God within you.","I have come in my Father\u2019s name
 and you do not receive me; if another comes in his own name
 him you will receive. ","How can you believe
 who receive glory from one another and do not seek the glory that comes from the only God? ","Do not think that I shall accuse you to the Father; it is Moses who accuses you
 on whom you set your hope. ","If you believed Moses
 you would believe me
 for he wrote of me. ","But if you do not believe his writings
 how will you believe my words?\u201d","Lifting up his eyes

 and gives life to the world.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cI am the bread of life; he who comes to me shall not hunger
 and he who believes in me shall never thirst. ","But I said to you that you have seen me and yet do not believe.","All that the Father gives me will come to me; and him who comes to me I will not cast out.","For I have come down from heaven
 not to do my own will
 but the will of him who sent me; ","and this is the will of him who sent me
 that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me
 but raise it up at the last day. ","For this is the will of my Father
 that every one who sees the Son and believes in him should have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cDo not murmur among yourselves. ","No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him; and I will raise him up at the last day.","It is written in the prophets
 \u2018And they shall all be taught by God.\u2019 Every one who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me. ","Not that any one has seen the Father except him who is from God; he has seen the Father.","Truly
 truly
 I say to you
 he who believes has eternal life. ","I am the bread of life.","Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness
 and they died. ","This is the bread which comes down from heaven
 that a man may eat of it and not die. ","I am the living bread which came down from heaven; if any one eats of this bread
 he will live for ever; and the bread which I shall give for the life of the world is my flesh.\u201d","So Jesus said to them
 \u201cTruly
 truly
 I say to you
 unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood
 you have no life in you; ","he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life
 and I will raise him up at the last day. ","For my flesh is food indeed
 and my blood is drink indeed. ","He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me
 and I in him. ","As the living Father sent me
 and I live because of the Father
 so he who eats me will live because of me. ","This is the bread which came down from heaven
 not such as the fathers ate and died; he who eats this bread will live for ever.\u201d ","But Jesus
 knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at it
 said to them
 \u201cDo you take offense at this? ","Then what if you were to see the Son of man ascending where he was before?","It is the spirit that gives life
 the flesh is of no avail; the words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life. ","But there are some of you that do not believe.\u201d For Jesus knew from the first who those were that did not believe
 and who it was that would betray him. ","And he said
 \u201cThis is why I told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted him by the Father.\u201d","Jesus said to the twelve
 \u201cDo you also wish to go away?\u201d ","Jesus answered them
 \u201cDid I not choose you
 the twelve
 and one of you is a devil?\u201d ","So his brothers said to him
 \u201cLeave here and go to Judea
 that your disciples may see the works you are doing. ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cMy time has not yet come
 but your time is always here. ","The world cannot hate you
 but it hates me because I testify of it that its works are evil. ","Go to the feast yourselves; I am not going up to this feast
 for my time has not yet fully come.\u201d ","So Jesus answered them
 \u201cMy teaching is not mine
 but his who sent me; ","if any man\u2019s will is to do his will
 he shall know whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own authority. ","He who speaks on his own authority seeks his own glory; but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true
 and in him there is no falsehood. ","Did not Moses give you the law? Yet none of you keeps the law. Why do you seek to kill me?\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cI did one deed
 and you all marvel at it. ","Moses gave you circumcision (not that it is from Moses
 but from the fathers)
 and you circumcise a man upon the sabbath. ","If on the sabbath a man receives circumcision
 so that the law of Moses may not be broken
 are you angry with me because on the sabbath I made a man\u2019s whole body well? ","Do not judge by appearances
 but judge with right judgment.\u201d","Some of the people of Jerusalem therefore said
 \u201cIs not this the man whom they seek to kill? ","So Jesus proclaimed
 as he taught in the temple
 \u201cYou know me
 and you know where I come from? But I have not come of my own accord; he who sent me is true
 and him you do not know. ","I know him
 for I come from him
 and he sent me.\u201d ","Jesus then said
 \u201cI shall be with you a little longer
 and then I go to him who sent me; ","you will seek me and you will not find me; where I am you cannot come.\u201d","The Jews said to one another
 \u201cWhere does this man intend to go that we shall not find him? Does he intend to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks? ","On the last day of the feast
 the great day
 Jesus stood up and proclaimed
 \u201cIf any one thirst
 let him come to me and drink. ","He who believes in me
 as the scripture has said
 \u2018Out of his heart shall flow rivers of living water.\u2019\u201d ","Now this he said about the Spirit
 which those who believed in him were to receive; for as yet the Spirit had not been given
 because Jesus was not yet glorified.","they said to him
 \u201cTeacher
 this woman has been caught in the act of adultery. ","And as they continued to ask him
 he stood up and said to them
 \u201cLet him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her.\u201d ","Jesus looked up and said to her
 \u201cWoman
 where are they? Has no one condemned you?\u201d ","She said
 \u201cNo one
 Lord.\u201d And Jesus said
 \u201cNeither do I condemn you; go
 and do not sin again.\u201d","Again Jesus spoke to them
 saying
 \u201cI am the light of the world; he who follows me will not walk in darkness
 but will have the light of life.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cEven if I do bear witness to myself
 my testimony is true
 for I know whence I have come and whither I am going
 but you do not know whence I come or whither I am going. ","You judge according to the flesh
 I judge no one. ","Yet even if I do judge
 my judgment is true
 for it is not I alone that judge
 but I and he who sent me. ","In your law it is written that the testimony of two men is true;","I bear witness to myself
 and the Father who sent me bears witness to me.\u201d ","They said to him therefore
 \u201cWhere is your Father?\u201d Jesus answered
 \u201cYou know neither me nor my Father; if you knew me
 you would know my Father also.\u201d ","Again he said to them
 \u201cI go away
 and you will seek me and die in your sin; where I am going
 you cannot come.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cYou are from below
 I am from above; you are of this world
 I am not of this world. ","I told you that you would die in your sins
 for you will die in your sins unless you believe that I am he.\u201d ","They said to him
 \u201cWho are you?\u201d Jesus said to them
 \u201cEven what I have told you from the beginning. ","I have much to say about you and much to judge; but he who sent me is true
 and I declare to the world what I have heard from him.\u201d ","So Jesus said
 \u201cWhen you have lifted up the Son of man
 then you will know that I am he
 and that I do nothing on my own authority but speak thus as the Father taught me. ","And he who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone
 for I always do what is pleasing to him.\u201d ","Jesus then said to the Jews who had believed in him
 \u201cIf you continue in my word
 you are truly my disciples
 ","and you will know the truth
 and the truth will make you free.\u201d ","Jesus answered them
 \u201cTruly
 truly
 I say to you
 every one who commits sin is a slave to sin. ","The slave does not continue in the house for ever; the son continues for ever.","So if the Son makes you free
 you will be free indeed. ","I know that you are descendants of Abraham; yet you seek to kill me
 because my word finds no place in you. ","I speak of what I have seen with my Father
 and you do what you have heard from your father.\u201d","They answered him
 \u201cAbraham is our father.\u201d Jesus said to them
 \u201cIf you were Abraham\u2019s children
 you would do what Abraham did
 ","but now you seek to kill me
 a man who has told you the truth which I heard from God; this is not what Abraham did. ","You do what your father did.\u201d They said to him
 \u201cWe were not born of fornication; we have one Father
 even God.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cIf God were your Father
 you would love me
 for I proceeded and came forth from God; I came not of my own accord
 but he sent me. ","Why do you not understand what I say? It is because you cannot bear to hear my word.","You are of your father the devil
 and your will is to do your father\u2019s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning
 and has nothing to do with the truth
 because there is no truth in him. When he lies
 he speaks according to his own nature
 for he is a liar and the father of lies. ","But
 because I tell the truth
 you do not believe me. ","Which of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth
 why do you not believe me? ","He who is of God hears the words of God; the reason why you do not hear them is that you are not of God.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cI have not a demon; but I honor my Father
 and you dishonor me. ","Yet I do not seek my own glory; there is One who seeks it and he will be the judge.","Truly
 truly
 I say to you
 if any one keeps my word
 he will never see death.\u201d ","The Jews said to him
 \u201cNow we know that you have a demon. Abraham died
 as did the prophets; and you say
 \u2018If any one keeps my word
 he will never taste death.\u2019 ","Jesus answered
 \u201cIf I glorify myself
 my glory is nothing; it is my Father who glorifies me
 of whom you say that he is your God. ","But you have not known him; I know him. If I said
 I do not know him
 I should be a liar like you; but I do know him and I keep his word. ","Your father Abraham rejoiced that he was to see my day; he saw it and was glad.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cTruly
 truly
 I say to you
 before Abraham was
 I am.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cIt was not that this man sinned
 or his parents
 but that the works of God might be made manifest in him. ","We must work the works of him who sent me
 while it is day; night comes
 when no one can work. ","As long as I am in the world
 I am the light of the world.\u201d ","saying to him
 \u201cGo
 wash in the pool of Silo\u2032am\u201d (which means Sent). So he went and washed and came back seeing. ","He answered
 \u201cThe man called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes and said to me
 \u2018Go to Silo\u2032am and wash\u2019; so I went and washed and received my sight.\u201d ","They said to him
 \u201cWhere is he?\u201d He said
 \u201cI do not know.\u201d","So for the second time they called the man who had been blind
 and said to him
 \u201cGive God the praise; we know that this man is a sinner.\u201d ","He answered
 \u201cWhether he is a sinner
 I do not know; one thing I know
 that though I was blind
 now I see.\u201d ","They said to him
 \u201cWhat did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?\u201d ","He answered them
 \u201cI have told you already
 and you would not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you too want to become his disciples?\u201d ","Jesus heard that they had cast him out
 and having found him he said
 \u201cDo you believe in the Son of man?\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cYou have seen him
 and it is he who speaks to you.\u201d ","Jesus said
 \u201cFor judgment I came into this world
 that those who do not see may see
 and that those who see may become blind.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cIf you were blind
 you would have no guilt; but now that you say
 \u2018We see
\u2019 your guilt remains.","\u201cTruly
 truly
 I say to you
 he who does not enter the sheepfold by the door but climbs in by another way
 that man is a thief and a robber; ","but he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.","To him the gatekeeper opens; the sheep hear his voice
 and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. ","When he has brought out all his own
 he goes before them
 and the sheep follow him
 for they know his voice. ","A stranger they will not follow
 but they will flee from him
 for they do not know the voice of strangers.\u201d ","So Jesus again said to them
 \u201cTruly
 truly
 I say to you
 I am the door of the sheep. ","All who came before me are thieves and robbers; but the sheep did not heed them.","I am the door; if any one enters by me
 he will be saved
 and will go in and out and find pasture. ","The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I came that they may have life
 and have it abundantly. ","I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.","He who is a hireling and not a shepherd
 whose own the sheep are not
 sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees; and the wolf snatches them and scatters them. ","He flees because he is a hireling and cares nothing for the sheep.","I am the good shepherd; I know my own and my own know me
 ","as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep.","And I have other sheep
 that are not of this fold; I must bring them also
 and they will heed my voice. So there shall be one flock
 one shepherd. ","For this reason the Father loves me
 because I lay down my life
 that I may take it again. ","No one takes it from me
 but I lay it down of my own accord. I have power to lay it down
 and I have power to take it again; this charge I have received from my Father.\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cI told you
 and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father\u2019s name
 they bear witness to me; ","but you do not believe
 because you do not belong to my sheep. ","My sheep hear my voice
 and I know them
 and they follow me; ","and I give them eternal life
 and they shall never perish
 and no one shall snatch them out of my hand. ","My Father
 who has given them to me
 is greater than all
 and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father\u2019s hand. ","I and the Father are one.\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cI have shown you many good works from the Father; for which of these do you stone me?\u201d ","Jesus answered them
 \u201cIs it not written in your law
 \u2018I said
 you are gods\u2019? ","If he called them gods to whom the word of God came (and scripture cannot be broken)
 ","do you say of him whom the Father consecrated and sent into the world
 \u2018You are blaspheming
\u2019 because I said
 \u2018I am the Son of God\u2019? ","If I am not doing the works of my Father
 then do not believe me; ","but if I do them
 even though you do not believe me
 believe the works
 that you may know and understand that the Father is in me and I am in the Father.\u201d ","But when Jesus heard it he said
 \u201cThis illness is not unto death; it is for the glory of God
 so that the Son of God may be glorified by means of it.\u201d","Then after this he said to the disciples
 \u201cLet us go into Judea again.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cAre there not twelve hours in the day? If any one walks in the day
 he does not stumble
 because he sees the light of this world. ","But if any one walks in the night
 he stumbles
 because the light is not in him.\u201d ","Thus he spoke
 and then he said to them
 \u201cOur friend Laz\u2032arus has fallen asleep
 but I go to awake him out of sleep.\u201d ","Then Jesus told them plainly
 \u201cLaz\u2032arus is dead; ","and for your sake I am glad that I was not there
 so that you may believe. But let us go to him.\u201d ","Thomas
 called the Twin
 said to his fellow disciples
 \u201cLet us also go
 that we may die with him.\u201d","Jesus said to her
 \u201cYour brother will rise again.\u201d ","Jesus said to her
 \u201cI am the resurrection and the life; he who believes in me
 though he die
 yet shall he live
 ","and whoever lives and believes in me shall never die. Do you believe this?\u201d","She said to him
 \u201cYes
 Lord; I believe that you are the Christ
 the Son of God
 he who is coming into the world.\u201d","Then Mary
 when she came where Jesus was and saw him
 fell at his feet
 saying to him
 \u201cLord
 if you had been here
 my brother would not have died.\u201d ","and he said
 \u201cWhere have you laid him?\u201d They said to him
 \u201cLord
 come and see.\u201d ","Jesus said
 \u201cTake away the stone.\u201d Martha
 the sister of the dead man
 said to him
 \u201cLord
 by this time there will be an odor
 for he has been dead four days.\u201d ","Jesus said to her
 \u201cDid I not tell you that if you would believe you would see the glory of God?\u201d ","So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes and said
 \u201cFather
 I thank thee that thou hast heard me. ","I knew that thou hearest me always
 but I have said this on account of the people standing by
 that they may believe that thou didst send me.\u201d ","When he had said this
 he cried with a loud voice
 \u201cLaz\u2032arus
 come out.\u201d ","The dead man came out
 his hands and feet bound with bandages
 and his face wrapped with a cloth. Jesus said to them
 \u201cUnbind him
 and let him go.\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cLet her alone
 let her keep it for the day of my burial. ","The poor you always have with you
 but you do not always have me.\u201d","The crowd that had been with him when he called Laz\u2032arus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead bore witness.","The Pharisees then said to one another
 \u201cYou see that you can do nothing; look
 the world has gone after him.\u201d","So these came to Philip
 who was from Beth-sa\u2032ida in Galilee
 and said to him
 \u201cSir
 we wish to see Jesus.\u201d ","And Jesus answered them
 \u201cThe hour has come for the Son of man to be glorified. ","Truly
 truly
 I say to you
 unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies
 it remains alone; but if it dies
 it bears much fruit. ","He who loves his life loses it
 and he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life. ","If any one serves me
 he must follow me; and where I am
 there shall my servant be also; if any one serves me
 the Father will honor him.","\u201cNow is my soul troubled. And what shall I say? \u2018Father
 save me from this hour\u2019? No
 for this purpose I have come to this hour. ","Father
 glorify thy name.\u201d Then a voice came from heaven
 \u201cI have glorified it
 and I will glorify it again.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cThis voice has come for your sake
 not for mine. ","Now is the judgment of this world
 now shall the ruler of this world be cast out; ","and I
 when I am lifted up from the earth
 will draw all men to myself.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cThe light is with you for a little longer. Walk while you have the light
 lest the darkness overtake you; he who walks in the darkness does not know where he goes. ","While you have the light
 believe in the light
 that you may become sons of light.\u201d When Jesus had said this
 he departed and hid himself from them. ","And Jesus cried out and said
 \u201cHe who believes in me
 believes not in me but in him who sent me. ","And he who sees me sees him who sent me.","I have come as light into the world
 that whoever believes in me may not remain in darkness. ","If any one hears my sayings and does not keep them
 I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world but to save the world. ","He who rejects me and does not receive my sayings has a judge; the word that I have spoken will be his judge on the last day.","For I have not spoken on my own authority; the Father who sent me has himself given me commandment what to say and what to speak.","And I know that his commandment is eternal life. What I say
 therefore
 I say as the Father has bidden me.\u201d","Jesus answered him
 \u201cWhat I am doing you do not know now
 but afterward you will understand.\u201d ","Peter said to him
 \u201cYou shall never wash my feet.\u201d Jesus answered him
 \u201cIf I do not wash you
 you have no part in me.\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cHe who has bathed does not need to wash
 except for his feet
 but he is clean all over; and you are clean
 but not every one of you.\u201d ","For he knew who was to betray him; that was why he said
 \u201cYou are not all clean.\u201d","When he had washed their feet
 and taken his garments
 and resumed his place
 he said to them
 \u201cDo you know what I have done to you? ","You call me Teacher and Lord; and you are right
 for so I am. ","If I then
 your Lord and Teacher
 have washed your feet
 you also ought to wash one another\u2019s feet. ","For I have given you an example
 that you also should do as I have done to you. ","Truly
 truly
 I say to you
 a servant is not greater than his master; nor is he who is sent greater than he who sent him. ","If you know these things
 blessed are you if you do them. ","I am not speaking of you all; I know whom I have chosen; it is that the scripture may be fulfilled
 \u2018He who ate my bread has lifted his heel against me.\u2019 ","I tell you this now
 before it takes place
 that when it does take place you may believe that I am he. ","Truly
 truly
 I say to you
 he who receives any one whom I send receives me; and he who receives me receives him who sent me.\u201d","When Jesus had thus spoken
 he was troubled in spirit
 and testified
 \u201cTruly
 truly
 I say to you
 one of you will betray me.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cIt is he to whom I shall give this morsel when I have dipped it.\u201d So when he had dipped the morsel
 he gave it to Judas
 the son of Simon Iscariot. ","Then after the morsel
 Satan entered into him. Jesus said to him
 \u201cWhat you are going to do
 do quickly.\u201d ","When he had gone out
 Jesus said
 \u201cNow is the Son of man glorified
 and in him God is glorified; ","if God is glorified in him
 God will also glorify him in himself
 and glorify him at once. ","Little children
 yet a little while I am with you. You will seek me; and as I said to the Jews so now I say to you
 \u2018Where I am going you cannot come.\u2019 ","A new commandment I give to you
 that you love one another; even as I have loved you
 that you also love one another. ","By this all men will know that you are my disciples
 if you have love for one another.\u201d","Simon Peter said to him
 \u201cLord
 where are you going?\u201d Jesus answered
 \u201cWhere I am going you cannot follow me now; but you shall follow afterward.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cWill you lay down your life for me? Truly
 truly
 I say to you
 the cock will not crow
 till you have denied me three times.","\u201cLet not your hearts be troubled; believe  in God
 believe also in me. ","In my Father\u2019s house are many rooms; if it were not so
 would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you? ","And when I go and prepare a place for you
 I will come again and will take you to myself
 that where I am you may be also. ","And you know the way where I am going.\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cI am the way
 and the truth
 and the life; no one comes to the Father
 but by me. ","If you had known me
 you would have known my Father also; henceforth you know him and have seen him.\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cHave I been with you so long
 and yet you do not know me

 \u2018Show us the Father\u2019? ","Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own authority; but the Father who dwells in me does his works.","Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father in me; or else believe me for the sake of the works themselves.","\u201cTruly
 truly
 I say to you
 he who believes in me will also do the works that I do; and greater works than these will he do
 because I go to the Father. ","Whatever you ask in my name
 I will do it
 that the Father may be glorified in the Son; ","if you ask anything in my name
 I will do it.","\u201cIf you love me
 you will keep my commandments. ","And I will pray the Father
 and he will give you another Counselor
 to be with you for ever
 ","even the Spirit of truth
 whom the world cannot receive
 because it neither sees him nor knows him; you know him
 for he dwells with you
 and will be in you.","\u201cI will not leave you desolate; I will come to you.","Yet a little while
 and the world will see me no more
 but you will see me; because I live
 you will live also. ","In that day you will know that I am in my Father
 and you in me
 and I in you. ","He who has my commandments and keeps them
 he it is who loves me; and he who loves me will be loved by my Father
 and I will love him and manifest myself to him.\u201d ","Judas (not Iscariot) said to him
 \u201cLord
 how is it that you will manifest yourself to us

 \u201cIf a man loves me
 he will keep my word
 and my Father will love him

 while I am still with you. ","But the Counselor
 the Holy Spirit
 whom the Father will send in my name
 he will teach you all things
 and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you. ","Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled
 neither let them be afraid. ","You heard me say to you
 \u2018I go away
 and I will come to you.\u2019 If you loved me
 you would have rejoiced
 because I go to the Father; for the Father is greater than I. ","And now I have told you before it takes place
 so that when it does take place
 you may believe. ","I will no longer talk much with you
 for the ruler of this world is coming. He has no power over me; ","but I do as the Father has commanded me
 so that the world may know that I love the Father. Rise
 let us go hence.","\u201cI am the true vine
 and my Father is the vinedresser. ","Every branch of mine that bears no fruit
 he takes away
 and every branch that does bear fruit he prunes
 that it may bear more fruit. ","You are already made clean by the word which I have spoken to you.","Abide in me
 and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself
 unless it abides in the vine
 neither can you
 unless you abide in me. ","I am the vine
 you are the branches. He who abides in me
 and I in him
 he it is that bears much fruit
 for apart from me you can do nothing. ","If a man does not abide in me
 he is cast forth as a branch and withers; and the branches are gathered
 thrown into the fire and burned. ","If you abide in me
 and my words abide in you
 ask whatever you will
 and it shall be done for you. ","By this my Father is glorified
 that you bear much fruit
 and so prove to be my disciples. ","As the Father has loved me
 so have I loved you; abide in my love. ","If you keep my commandments
 you will abide in my love
 just as I have kept my Father\u2019s commandments and abide in his love. ","These things I have spoken to you
 that my joy may be in you
 and that your joy may be full.","\u201cThis is my commandment
 that you love one another as I have loved you. ","Greater love has no man than this
 that a man lay down his life for his friends. ","You are my friends if you do what I command you.","No longer do I call you servants
 for the servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends
 for all that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you. ","You did not choose me
 but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide; so that whatever you ask the Father in my name
 he may give it to you. ","This I command you
 to love one another.","\u201cIf the world hates you
 know that it has hated me before it hated you. ","If you were of the world
 the world would love its own; but because you are not of the world
 but I chose you out of the world
 therefore the world hates you. ","Remember the word that I said to you
 \u2018A servant is not greater than his master.\u2019 If they persecuted me
 they will persecute you; if they kept my word
 they will keep yours also. ","But all this they will do to you on my account
 because they do not know him who sent me. ","If I had not come and spoken to them
 they would not have sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin. ","He who hates me hates my Father also.","If I had not done among them the works which no one else did
 they would not have sin; but now they have seen and hated both me and my Father. ","It is to fulfil the word that is written in their law
 \u2018They hated me without a cause.\u2019 ","But when the Counselor comes
 whom I shall send to you from the Father
 even the Spirit of truth
 who proceeds from the Father
 he will bear witness to me; ","and you also are witnesses
 because you have been with me from the beginning.","\u201cI have said all this to you to keep you from falling away.","They will put you out of the synagogues; indeed
 the hour is coming when whoever kills you will think he is offering service to God. ","And they will do this because they have not known the Father
 nor me. ","But I have said these things to you
 that when their hour comes you may remember that I told you of them. \u201cI did not say these things to you from the beginning
 because I was with you. ","But now I am going to him who sent me; yet none of you asks me
 \u2018Where are you going?\u2019 ","But because I have said these things to you
 sorrow has filled your hearts. ","Nevertheless I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away
 for if I do not go away
 the Counselor will not come to you; but if I go
 I will send him to you. ","And when he comes
 he will convince the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment: ","concerning sin
 because they do not believe in me; ","concerning righteousness
 because I go to the Father
 and you will see me no more; ","concerning judgment
 because the ruler of this world is judged.","\u201cI have yet many things to say to you
 but you cannot bear them now. ","When the Spirit of truth comes
 he will guide you into all the truth; for he will not speak on his own authority
 but whatever he hears he will speak
 and he will declare to you the things that are to come. ","He will glorify me
 for he will take what is mine and declare it to you. ","All that the Father has is mine; therefore I said that he will take what is mine and declare it to you.","\u201cA little while
 and you will see me no more; again a little while
 and you will see me.\u201d ","Some of his disciples said to one another
 \u201cWhat is this that he says to us
 \u2018A little while
 and you will not see me
 and again a little while
 and you will see me\u2019; and
 \u2018because I go to the Father\u2019?\u201d ","They said
 \u201cWhat does he mean by \u2018a little while\u2019? We do not know what he means.\u201d ","Jesus knew that they wanted to ask him; so he said to them
 \u201cIs this what you are asking yourselves
 what I meant by saying
 \u2018A little while
 and you will not see me
 and again a little while
 and you will see me\u2019? ","Truly
 truly
 I say to you
 you will weep and lament
 but the world will rejoice; you will be sorrowful
 but your sorrow will turn into joy. ","When a woman is in travail she has sorrow
 because her hour has come; but when she is delivered of the child
 she no longer remembers the anguish
 for joy that a child is born into the world. ","So you have sorrow now
 but I will see you again and your hearts will rejoice
 and no one will take your joy from you. ","In that day you will ask nothing of me. Truly
 truly
 I say to you
 if you ask anything of the Father
 he will give it to you in my name. ","Hitherto you have asked nothing in my name; ask
 and you will receive
 that your joy may be full.","\u201cI have said this to you in figures; the hour is coming when I shall no longer speak to you in figures but tell you plainly of the Father.","In that day you will ask in my name; and I do not say to you that I shall pray the Father for you;","for the Father himself loves you
 because you have loved me and have believed that I came from the Father. ","I came from the Father and have come into the world; again
 I am leaving the world and going to the Father.\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cDo you now believe? ","The hour is coming
 indeed it has come
 when you will be scattered
 every man to his home
 and will leave me alone; yet I am not alone
 for the Father is with me. ","I have said this to you
 that in me you may have peace. In the world you have tribulation; but be of good cheer
 I have overcome the world.\u201d","When Jesus had spoken these words
 he lifted up his eyes to heaven and said
 \u201cFather
 the hour has come; glorify thy Son that the Son may glorify thee
 ","since thou hast given him power over all flesh
 to give eternal life to all whom thou hast given him. ","And this is eternal life
 that they know thee the only true God
 and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent. ","I glorified thee on earth
 having accomplished the work which thou gavest me to do; ","and now
 Father
 glorify thou me in thy own presence with the glory which I had with thee before the world was made.","\u201cI have manifested thy name to the men whom thou gavest me out of the world; thine they were
 and thou gavest them to me
 and they have kept thy word. ","Now they know that everything that thou hast given me is from thee;","for I have given them the words which thou gavest me
 and they have received them and know in truth that I came from thee; and they have believed that thou didst send me. ","I am praying for them; I am not praying for the world but for those whom thou hast given me
 for they are thine; ","all mine are thine
 and thine are mine
 and I am glorified in them. ","And now I am no more in the world
 but they are in the world
 and I am coming to thee. Holy Father
 keep them in thy name
 which thou hast given me
 that they may be one
 even as we are one. ","While I was with them
 I kept them in thy name
 which thou hast given me; I have guarded them
 and none of them is lost but the son of perdition
 that the scripture might be fulfilled. ","But now I am coming to thee; and these things I speak in the world
 that they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves. ","I have given them thy word; and the world has hated them because they are not of the world
 even as I am not of the world. ","I do not pray that thou shouldst take them out of the world
 but that thou shouldst keep them from the evil one. ","They are not of the world
 even as I am not of the world. ","Sanctify them in the truth; thy word is truth.","As thou didst send me into the world
 so I have sent them into the world. ","And for their sake I consecrate myself
 that they also may be consecrated in truth.","\u201cI do not pray for these only
 but also for those who believe in me through their word
 ","that they may all be one; even as thou
 Father
 art in me
 and I in thee
 that they also may be in us
 so that the world may believe that thou hast sent me. ","The glory which thou hast given me I have given to them
 that they may be one even as we are one
 ","I in them and thou in me
 that they may become perfectly one
 so that the world may know that thou hast sent me and hast loved them even as thou hast loved me. ","Father
 I desire that they also
 whom thou hast given me
 may be with me where I am
 to behold my glory which thou hast given me in thy love for me before the foundation of the world. ","O righteous Father
 the world has not known thee
 but I have known thee; and these know that thou hast sent me. ","I made known to them thy name
 and I will make it known
 that the love with which thou hast loved me may be in them
 and I in them.\u201d","Then Jesus
 knowing all that was to befall him
 came forward and said to them
 \u201cWhom do you seek?\u201d ","They answered him
 \u201cJesus of Nazareth.\u201d Jesus said to them
 \u201cI am he.\u201d Judas
 who betrayed him
 was standing with them. ","When he said to them
 \u201cI am he
\u201d they drew back and fell to the ground. ","Again he asked them
 \u201cWhom do you seek?\u201d And they said
 \u201cJesus of Nazareth.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cI told you that I am he; so
 if you seek me
 let these men go.\u201d ","Jesus said to Peter
 \u201cPut your sword into its sheath; shall I not drink the cup which the Father has given me?\u201d","The maid who kept the door said to Peter
 \u201cAre not you also one of this man\u2019s disciples?\u201d He said
 \u201cI am not.\u201d ","Jesus answered him
 \u201cI have spoken openly to the world; I have always taught in synagogues and in the temple
 where all Jews come together; I have said nothing secretly. ","Why do you ask me? Ask those who have heard me
 what I said to them; they know what I said.\u201d ","Jesus answered him
 \u201cIf I have spoken wrongly
 bear witness to the wrong; but if I have spoken rightly
 why do you strike me?\u201d ","Pilate said to them
 \u201cTake him yourselves and judge him by your own law.\u201d The Jews said to him
 \u201cIt is not lawful for us to put any man to death.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cDo you say this of your own accord
 or did others say it to you about me?\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cMy kingship is not of this world; if my kingship were of this world
 my servants would fight
 that I might not be handed over to the Jews; but my kingship is not from the world.\u201d ","Pilate said to him
 \u201cSo you are a king?\u201d Jesus answered
 \u201cYou say that I am a king. For this I was born
 and for this I have come into the world
 to bear witness to the truth. Every one who is of the truth hears my voice.\u201d ","Pilate went out again
 and said to them
 \u201cSee
 I am bringing him out to you
 that you may know that I find no crime in him.\u201d ","So Jesus came out
 wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them
 \u201cBehold the man!\u201d ","When the chief priests and the officers saw him
 they cried out
 \u201cCrucify him
 crucify him!\u201d Pilate said to them
 \u201cTake him yourselves and crucify him
 for I find no crime in him.\u201d ","Jesus answered him
 \u201cYou would have no power over me unless it had been given you from above; therefore he who delivered me to you has the greater sin.\u201d","Now it was the day of Preparation of the Passover; it was about the sixth hour. He said to the Jews
 \u201cBehold your King!\u201d ","When Jesus saw his mother
 and the disciple whom he loved standing near
 he said to his mother
 \u201cWoman
 behold
 your son!\u201d ","Then he said to the disciple
 \u201cBehold
 your mother!\u201d And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home.","After this Jesus
 knowing that all was now finished
 said (to fulfil the scripture)
 \u201cI thirst.\u201d ","When Jesus had received the vinegar
 he said
 \u201cIt is finished\u201d; and he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.","So she ran
 and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple
 the one whom Jesus loved
 and said to them
 \u201cThey have taken the Lord out of the tomb
 and we do not know where they have laid him.\u201d ","They said to her
 \u201cWoman
 why are you weeping?\u201d She said to them
 \u201cBecause they have taken away my Lord
 and I do not know where they have laid him.\u201d ","Jesus said to her
 \u201cWoman
 why are you weeping? Whom do you seek?\u201d Supposing him to be the gardener
 she said to him
 \u201cSir
 if you have carried him away
 tell me where you have laid him
 and I will take him away.\u201d ","Jesus said to her
 \u201cMary.\u201d She turned and said to him in Hebrew
 \u201cRab-bo\u2032ni!\u201d (which means Teacher). ","Jesus said to her
 \u201cDo not hold me
 for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to my brethren and say to them
 I am ascending to my Father and your Father
 to my God and your God.\u201d ","On the evening of that day
 the first day of the week
 the doors being shut where the disciples were
 for fear of the Jews
 Jesus came and stood among them and said to them
 \u201cPeace be with you.\u201d ","Jesus said to them again
 \u201cPeace be with you. As the Father has sent me
 even so I send you.\u201d ","And when he had said this
 he breathed on them
 and said to them
 \u201cReceive the Holy Spirit. ","If you forgive the sins of any
 they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any
 they are retained.\u201d","So the other disciples told him
 \u201cWe have seen the Lord.\u201d But he said to them
 \u201cUnless I see in his hands the print of the nails
 and place my finger in the mark of the nails
 and place my hand in his side
 I will not believe.\u201d","Eight days later
 his disciples were again in the house
 and Thomas was with them. The doors were shut
 but Jesus came and stood among them
 and said
 \u201cPeace be with you.\u201d ","Then he said to Thomas
 \u201cPut your finger here
 and see my hands; and put out your hand
 and place it in my side; do not be faithless
 but believing.\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cHave you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet believe.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cChildren
 have you any fish?\u201d They answered him
 \u201cNo.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cBring some of the fish that you have just caught.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cCome and have breakfast.\u201d Now none of the disciples dared ask him
 \u201cWho are you?\u201d They knew it was the Lord. ","When they had finished breakfast
 Jesus said to Simon Peter
 \u201cSimon
 son of John
 do you love me more than these?\u201d He said to him
 \u201cYes
 Lord; you know that I love you.\u201d He said to him
 \u201cFeed my lambs.\u201d ","A second time he said to him
 \u201cSimon
 son of John
 do you love me?\u201d He said to him
 \u201cYes
 Lord; you know that I love you.\u201d He said to him
 \u201cTend my sheep.\u201d ","He said to him the third time
 \u201cSimon
 son of John
 do you love me?\u201d Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time
 \u201cDo you love me?\u201d And he said to him
 \u201cLord
 you know everything; you know that I love you.\u201d Jesus said to him
 \u201cFeed my sheep. ","Truly
 truly
 I say to you
 when you were young
 you girded yourself and walked where you would; but when you are old
 you will stretch out your hands
 and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish to go.\u201d ","(This he said to show by what death he was to glorify God.) And after this he said to him
 \u201cFollow me.\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cIf it is my will that he remain until I come
 what is that to you? Follow me!\u201d ","The saying spread abroad among the brethren that this disciple was not to die; yet Jesus did not say to him that he was not to die
 but
 \u201cIf it is my will that he remain until I come
 what is that to you?\u201d","And they asked him
 \u201cWhat then? Are you Eli\u2032jah?\u201d He said
 \u201cI am not.\u201d \u201cAre you the prophet?\u201d And he answered
 \u201cNo.\u201d ","They said to him then
 \u201cWho are you? Let us have an answer for those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?\u201d ","He said
 \u201cI am the voice of one crying in the wilderness

 and saw them following

 \u201cCome and see.\u201d They came and saw where he was staying; and they stayed with him that day

 and said
 \u201cSo you are Simon the son of John? You shall be called Cephas\u201d (which means Peter).","The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee. And he found Philip and said to him
 \u201cFollow me.\u201d ","Philip found Nathan\u2032a-el

 \u201cWe have found him of whom Moses in the law and also the prophets wrote

 \u201cCan anything good come out of Nazareth?\u201d Philip said to him
 \u201cCome and see.\u201d ","Jesus saw Nathan\u2032a-el coming to him

 \u201cHow do you know me?\u201d Jesus answered him
 \u201cBefore Philip called you
 when you were under the fig tree

 the Son of man. ","And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness
 so must the Son of man be lifted up
 ","that whoever believes in him may have eternal life.\u201d","For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son
 that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. ","For God sent the Son into the world
 not to condemn the world

 \u201cUnless you see signs and wonders you will not believe.\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cGo; your son will live.\u201d The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and went his way. ","So he asked them the hour when he began to mend

 truly
 I say to you
 the Son can do nothing of his own accord

 that the Son does likewise. ","For the Father loves the Son
 and shows him all that he himself is doing; and greater works than these will he show him
 that you may marvel. ","For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life
 so also the Son gives life to whom he will. ","The Father judges no one

 but has passed from death to life.","\u201cTruly
 truly
 I say to you
 the hour is coming
 and now is
 when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God
 and those who hear will live. ","For as the Father has life in himself
 so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself
 ","and has given him authority to execute judgment
 because he is the Son of man. ","Do not marvel at this; for the hour is coming when all who are in the tombs will hear his voice","and come forth
 those who have done good
 to the resurrection of life
 and those who have done evil
 to the resurrection of judgment.","\u201cI can do nothing on my own authority; as I hear
 I judge; and my judgment is just

 and I know that the testimony which he bears to me is true. ","You sent to John
 and he has borne witness to the truth. ","Not that the testimony which I receive is from man; but I say this that you may be saved.","He was a burning and shining lamp
 and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light. ","But the testimony which I have is greater than that of John; for the works which the Father has granted me to accomplish
 these very works which I am doing
 bear me witness that the Father has sent me. ","And the Father who sent me has himself borne witness to me. His voice you have never heard
 his form you have never seen; ","and you do not have his word abiding in you
 for you do not believe him whom he has sent. ","You search the scriptures
 because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is they that bear witness to me; ","yet you refuse to come to me that you may have life.","I do not receive glory from men.","But I know that you have not the love of God within you.","I have come in my Father\u2019s name
 and you do not receive me; if another comes in his own name
 him you will receive. ","How can you believe
 who receive glory from one another and do not seek the glory that comes from the only God? ","Do not think that I shall accuse you to the Father; it is Moses who accuses you
 on whom you set your hope. ","If you believed Moses
 you would believe me
 for he wrote of me. ","But if you do not believe his writings
 how will you believe my words?\u201d","Lifting up his eyes
 then
 and seeing that a multitude was coming to him
 Jesus said to Philip
 \u201cHow are we to buy bread
 so that these people may eat?\u201d ","Jesus said
 \u201cMake the people sit down.\u201d Now there was much grass in the place; so the men sat down
 in number about five thousand. ","And when they had eaten their fill
 he told his disciples
 \u201cGather up the fragments left over
 that nothing may be lost.\u201d ","but he said to them
 \u201cIt is I; do not be afraid.\u201d ","Jesus answered them
 \u201cTruly
 truly
 I say to you
 you seek me
 not because you saw signs
 but because you ate your fill of the loaves. ","Do not labor for the food which perishes
 but for the food which endures to eternal life
 which the Son of man will give to you; for on him has God the Father set his seal.\u201d ","Jesus answered them
 \u201cThis is the work of God
 that you believe in him whom he has sent.\u201d ","Jesus then said to them
 \u201cTruly
 truly
 I say to you
 it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven; my Father gives you the true bread from heaven. ","For the bread of God is that which comes down from heaven
 and gives life to the world.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cI am the bread of life; he who comes to me shall not hunger
 and he who believes in me shall never thirst. ","But I said to you that you have seen me and yet do not believe.","All that the Father gives me will come to me; and him who comes to me I will not cast out.","For I have come down from heaven
 not to do my own will
 but the will of him who sent me; ","and this is the will of him who sent me
 that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me
 but raise it up at the last day. ","For this is the will of my Father
 that every one who sees the Son and believes in him should have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cDo not murmur among yourselves. ","No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him; and I will raise him up at the last day.","It is written in the prophets
 \u2018And they shall all be taught by God.\u2019 Every one who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me. ","Not that any one has seen the Father except him who is from God; he has seen the Father.","Truly
 truly
 I say to you
 he who believes has eternal life. ","I am the bread of life.","Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness
 and they died. ","This is the bread which comes down from heaven
 that a man may eat of it and not die. ","I am the living bread which came down from heaven; if any one eats of this bread
 he will live for ever; and the bread which I shall give for the life of the world is my flesh.\u201d","So Jesus said to them
 \u201cTruly
 truly
 I say to you
 unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood
 you have no life in you; ","he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life
 and I will raise him up at the last day. ","For my flesh is food indeed
 and my blood is drink indeed. ","He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me
 and I in him. ","As the living Father sent me
 and I live because of the Father
 so he who eats me will live because of me. ","This is the bread which came down from heaven
 not such as the fathers ate and died; he who eats this bread will live for ever.\u201d ","But Jesus
 knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at it
 said to them
 \u201cDo you take offense at this? ","Then what if you were to see the Son of man ascending where he was before?","It is the spirit that gives life
 the flesh is of no avail; the words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life. ","But there are some of you that do not believe.\u201d For Jesus knew from the first who those were that did not believe
 and who it was that should betray him. ","And he said
 \u201cThis is why I told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted him by the Father.\u201d","Jesus said to the twelve
 \u201cWill you also go away?\u201d ","Jesus answered them
 \u201cDid I not choose you
 the twelve
 and one of you is a devil?\u201d ","So his brethren said to him
 \u201cLeave here and go to Judea
 that your disciples may see the works you are doing. ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cMy time has not yet come
 but your time is always here. ","The world cannot hate you
 but it hates me because I testify of it that its works are evil. ","Go to the feast yourselves; I am not going up to this feast
 for my time has not yet fully come.\u201d ","So Jesus answered them
 \u201cMy teaching is not mine
 but his who sent me; ","if any man\u2019s will is to do his will
 he shall know whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own authority. ","He who speaks on his own authority seeks his own glory; but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true
 and in him there is no falsehood. ","Did not Moses give you the law? Yet none of you keeps the law. Why do you seek to kill me?\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cI did one deed
 and you all marvel at it. ","Moses gave you circumcision (not that it is from Moses
 but from the fathers)
 and you circumcise a man upon the sabbath. ","If on the sabbath a man receives circumcision
 so that the law of Moses may not be broken
 are you angry with me because on the sabbath I made a man\u2019s whole body well? ","Do not judge by appearances
 but judge with right judgment.\u201d","Some of the people of Jerusalem therefore said
 \u201cIs not this the man whom they seek to kill? ","So Jesus proclaimed
 as he taught in the temple
 \u201cYou know me
 and you know where I come from? But I have not come of my own accord; he who sent me is true
 and him you do not know. ","I know him
 for I come from him
 and he sent me.\u201d ","Jesus then said
 \u201cI shall be with you a little longer
 and then I go to him who sent me; ","you will seek me and you will not find me; where I am you cannot come.\u201d","The Jews said to one another
 \u201cWhere does this man intend to go that we shall not find him? Does he intend to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks? ","On the last day of the feast
 the great day
 Jesus stood up and proclaimed
 \u201cIf any one thirst
 let him come to me and drink. ","He who believes in me
 as the scripture has said
 \u2018Out of his heart shall flow rivers of living water.\u2019\u201d ","Now this he said about the Spirit
 which those who believed in him were to receive; for as yet the Spirit had not been given
 because Jesus was not yet glorified.","they said to him
 \u201cTeacher
 this woman has been caught in the act of adultery. ","And as they continued to ask him
 he stood up and said to them
 \u201cLet him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her.\u201d ","Jesus looked up and said to her
 \u201cWoman
 where are they? Has no one condemned you?\u201d ","She said
 \u201cNo one
 Lord.\u201d And Jesus said
 \u201cNeither do I condemn you; go
 and do not sin again.\u201d","Again Jesus spoke to them
 saying
 \u201cI am the light of the world; he who follows me will not walk in darkness
 but will have the light of life.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cEven if I do bear witness to myself
 my testimony is true
 for I know whence I have come and whither I am going
 but you do not know whence I come or whither I am going. ","You judge according to the flesh
 I judge no one. ","Yet even if I do judge
 my judgment is true
 for it is not I alone that judge
 but I and he who sent me. ","In your law it is written that the testimony of two men is true;","I bear witness to myself
 and the Father who sent me bears witness to me.\u201d ","They said to him therefore
 \u201cWhere is your Father?\u201d Jesus answered
 \u201cYou know neither me nor my Father; if you knew me
 you would know my Father also.\u201d ","Again he said to them
 \u201cI go away
 and you will seek me and die in your sin; where I am going
 you cannot come.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cYou are from below
 I am from above; you are of this world
 I am not of this world. ","I told you that you would die in your sins
 for you will die in your sins unless you believe that I am he.\u201d ","They said to him
 \u201cWho are you?\u201d Jesus said to them
 \u201cEven what I have told you from the beginning. ","I have much to say about you and much to judge; but he who sent me is true
 and I declare to the world what I have heard from him.\u201d ","So Jesus said
 \u201cWhen you have lifted up the Son of man
 then you will know that I am he
 and that I do nothing on my own authority but speak thus as the Father taught me. ","And he who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone
 for I always do what is pleasing to him.\u201d ","Jesus then said to the Jews who had believed in him
 \u201cIf you continue in my word
 you are truly my disciples
 ","and you will know the truth
 and the truth will make you free.\u201d ","Jesus answered them
 \u201cTruly
 truly
 I say to you
 every one who commits sin is a slave to sin. ","The slave does not continue in the house for ever; the son continues for ever.","So if the Son makes you free
 you will be free indeed. ","I know that you are descendants of Abraham; yet you seek to kill me
 because my word finds no place in you. ","I speak of what I have seen with my Father
 and you do what you have heard from your father.\u201d","They answered him
 \u201cAbraham is our father.\u201d Jesus said to them
 \u201cIf you were Abraham\u2019s children
 you would do what Abraham did
 ","but now you seek to kill me
 a man who has told you the truth which I heard from God; this is not what Abraham did. ","You do what your father did.\u201d They said to him
 \u201cWe were not born of fornication; we have one Father
 even God.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cIf God were your Father
 you would love me
 for I proceeded and came forth from God; I came not of my own accord
 but he sent me. ","Why do you not understand what I say? It is because you cannot bear to hear my word.","You are of your father the devil
 and your will is to do your father\u2019s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning
 and has nothing to do with the truth
 because there is no truth in him. When he lies
 he speaks according to his own nature
 for he is a liar and the father of lies. ","But
 because I tell the truth
 you do not believe me. ","Which of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth
 why do you not believe me? ","He who is of God hears the words of God; the reason why you do not hear them is that you are not of God.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cI have not a demon; but I honor my Father
 and you dishonor me. ","Yet I do not seek my own glory; there is One who seeks it and he will be the judge.","Truly
 truly
 I say to you
 if any one keeps my word
 he will never see death.\u201d ","The Jews said to him
 \u201cNow we know that you have a demon. Abraham died
 as did the prophets; and you say
 \u2018If any one keeps my word
 he will never taste death.\u2019 ","Jesus answered
 \u201cIf I glorify myself
 my glory is nothing; it is my Father who glorifies me
 of whom you say that he is your God. ","But you have not known him; I know him. If I said
 I do not know him
 I should be a liar like you; but I do know him and I keep his word. ","Your father Abraham rejoiced that he was to see my day; he saw it and was glad.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cTruly
 truly
 I say to you
 before Abraham was
 I am.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cIt was not that this man sinned
 or his parents
 but that the works of God might be made manifest in him. ","We must work the works of him who sent me
 while it is day; night comes
 when no one can work. ","As long as I am in the world
 I am the light of the world.\u201d ","saying to him
 \u201cGo
 wash in the pool of Silo\u2032am\u201d (which means Sent). So he went and washed and came back seeing. ","He answered
 \u201cThe man called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes and said to me
 \u2018Go to Silo\u2032am and wash\u2019; so I went and washed and received my sight.\u201d ","They said to him
 \u201cWhere is he?\u201d He said
 \u201cI do not know.\u201d","So for the second time they called the man who had been blind
 and said to him
 \u201cGive God the praise; we know that this man is a sinner.\u201d ","He answered
 \u201cWhether he is a sinner
 I do not know; one thing I know
 that though I was blind
 now I see.\u201d ","They said to him
 \u201cWhat did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?\u201d ","He answered them
 \u201cI have told you already
 and you would not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you too want to become his disciples?\u201d ","Jesus heard that they had cast him out
 and having found him he said
 \u201cDo you believe in the Son of man?\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cYou have seen him
 and it is he who speaks to you.\u201d ","Jesus said
 \u201cFor judgment I came into this world
 that those who do not see may see
 and that those who see may become blind.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cIf you were blind
 you would have no guilt; but now that you say
 \u2018We see
\u2019 your guilt remains.","\u201cTruly
 truly
 I say to you
 he who does not enter the sheepfold by the door but climbs in by another way
 that man is a thief and a robber; ","but he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.","To him the gatekeeper opens; the sheep hear his voice
 and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. ","When he has brought out all his own
 he goes before them
 and the sheep follow him
 for they know his voice. ","A stranger they will not follow
 but they will flee from him
 for they do not know the voice of strangers.\u201d ","So Jesus again said to them
 \u201cTruly
 truly
 I say to you
 I am the door of the sheep. ","All who came before me are thieves and robbers; but the sheep did not heed them.","I am the door; if any one enters by me
 he will be saved
 and will go in and out and find pasture. ","The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I came that they may have life
 and have it abundantly. ","I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.","He who is a hireling and not a shepherd
 whose own the sheep are not
 sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees; and the wolf snatches them and scatters them. ","He flees because he is a hireling and cares nothing for the sheep.","I am the good shepherd; I know my own and my own know me
 ","as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep.","And I have other sheep
 that are not of this fold; I must bring them also
 and they will heed my voice. So there shall be one flock
 one shepherd. ","For this reason the Father loves me
 because I lay down my life
 that I may take it again. ","No one takes it from me
 but I lay it down of my own accord. I have power to lay it down
 and I have power to take it again; this charge I have received from my Father.\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cI told you
 and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father\u2019s name
 they bear witness to me; ","but you do not believe
 because you do not belong to my sheep. ","My sheep hear my voice
 and I know them
 and they follow me; ","and I give them eternal life
 and they shall never perish
 and no one shall snatch them out of my hand. ","My Father
 who has given them to me
 is greater than all
 and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father\u2019s hand. ","I and the Father are one.\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cI have shown you many good works from the Father; for which of these do you stone me?\u201d ","Jesus answered them
 \u201cIs it not written in your law
 \u2018I said
 you are gods\u2019? ","If he called them gods to whom the word of God came (and scripture cannot be broken)
 ","do you say of him whom the Father consecrated and sent into the world
 \u2018You are blaspheming
\u2019 because I said
 \u2018I am the Son of God\u2019? ","If I am not doing the works of my Father
 then do not believe me; ","but if I do them
 even though you do not believe me
 believe the works
 that you may know and understand that the Father is in me and I am in the Father.\u201d ","But when Jesus heard it he said
 \u201cThis illness is not unto death; it is for the glory of God
 so that the Son of God may be glorified by means of it.\u201d","Then after this he said to the disciples
 \u201cLet us go into Judea again.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cAre there not twelve hours in the day? If any one walks in the day
 he does not stumble
 because he sees the light of this world. ","But if any one walks in the night
 he stumbles
 because the light is not in him.\u201d ","Thus he spoke
 and then he said to them
 \u201cOur friend Laz\u2032arus has fallen asleep
 but I go to awake him out of sleep.\u201d ","Then Jesus told them plainly
 \u201cLaz\u2032arus is dead; ","and for your sake I am glad that I was not there
 so that you may believe. But let us go to him.\u201d ","Thomas
 called the Twin
 said to his fellow disciples
 \u201cLet us also go
 that we may die with him.\u201d","Jesus said to her
 \u201cYour brother will rise again.\u201d ","Jesus said to her
 \u201cI am the resurrection and the life; he who believes in me
 though he die
 yet shall he live
 ","and whoever lives and believes in me shall never die. Do you believe this?\u201d","She said to him
 \u201cYes
 Lord; I believe that you are the Christ
 the Son of God
 he who is coming into the world.\u201d","Then Mary
 when she came where Jesus was and saw him
 fell at his feet
 saying to him
 \u201cLord
 if you had been here
 my brother would not have died.\u201d ","and he said
 \u201cWhere have you laid him?\u201d They said to him
 \u201cLord
 come and see.\u201d ","Jesus said
 \u201cTake away the stone.\u201d Martha
 the sister of the dead man
 said to him
 \u201cLord
 by this time there will be an odor
 for he has been dead four days.\u201d ","Jesus said to her
 \u201cDid I not tell you that if you would believe you would see the glory of God?\u201d ","So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes and said
 \u201cFather
 I thank thee that thou hast heard me. ","I knew that thou hearest me always
 but I have said this on account of the people standing by
 that they may believe that thou didst send me.\u201d ","When he had said this
 he cried with a loud voice
 \u201cLaz\u2032arus
 come out.\u201d ","The dead man came out
 his hands and feet bound with bandages
 and his face wrapped with a cloth. Jesus said to them
 \u201cUnbind him
 and let him go.\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cLet her alone
 let her keep it for the day of my burial. ","The poor you always have with you
 but you do not always have me.\u201d","The crowd that had been with him when he called Laz\u2032arus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead bore witness.","The Pharisees then said to one another
 \u201cYou see that you can do nothing; look
 the world has gone after him.\u201d","So these came to Philip
 who was from Beth-sa\u2032ida in Galilee
 and said to him
 \u201cSir
 we wish to see Jesus.\u201d ","And Jesus answered them
 \u201cThe hour has come for the Son of man to be glorified. ","Truly
 truly
 I say to you
 unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies
 it remains alone; but if it dies
 it bears much fruit. ","He who loves his life loses it
 and he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life. ","If any one serves me
 he must follow me; and where I am
 there shall my servant be also; if any one serves me
 the Father will honor him.","\u201cNow is my soul troubled. And what shall I say? \u2018Father
 save me from this hour\u2019? No
 for this purpose I have come to this hour. ","Father
 glorify thy name.\u201d Then a voice came from heaven
 \u201cI have glorified it
 and I will glorify it again.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cThis voice has come for your sake
 not for mine. ","Now is the judgment of this world
 now shall the ruler of this world be cast out; ","and I
 when I am lifted up from the earth
 will draw all men to myself.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cThe light is with you for a little longer. Walk while you have the light
 lest the darkness overtake you; he who walks in the darkness does not know where he goes. ","While you have the light
 believe in the light
 that you may become sons of light.\u201d When Jesus had said this
 he departed and hid himself from them. ","And Jesus cried out and said
 \u201cHe who believes in me
 believes not in me but in him who sent me. ","And he who sees me sees him who sent me.","I have come as light into the world
 that whoever believes in me may not remain in darkness. ","If any one hears my sayings and does not keep them
 I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world but to save the world. ","He who rejects me and does not receive my sayings has a judge; the word that I have spoken will be his judge on the last day.","For I have not spoken on my own authority; the Father who sent me has himself given me commandment what to say and what to speak.","And I know that his commandment is eternal life. What I say
 therefore
 I say as the Father has bidden me.\u201d","Jesus answered him
 \u201cWhat I am doing you do not know now
 but afterward you will understand.\u201d ","Peter said to him
 \u201cYou shall never wash my feet.\u201d Jesus answered him
 \u201cIf I do not wash you
 you have no part in me.\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cHe who has bathed does not need to wash
 except for his feet
 but he is clean all over; and you are clean
 but not all of you.\u201d ","For he knew who was to betray him; that was why he said
 \u201cYou are not all clean.\u201d","When he had washed their feet
 and taken his garments
 and resumed his place
 he said to them
 \u201cDo you know what I have done to you? ","You call me Teacher and Lord; and you are right
 for so I am. ","If I then
 your Lord and Teacher
 have washed your feet
 you also ought to wash one another\u2019s feet. ","For I have given you an example
 that you also should do as I have done to you. ","Truly
 truly
 I say to you
 a servant is not greater than his master; nor is he who is sent greater than he who sent him. ","If you know these things
 blessed are you if you do them. ","I am not speaking of you all; I know whom I have chosen; it is that the scripture may be fulfilled
 \u2018He who ate my bread has lifted his heel against me.\u2019 ","I tell you this now
 before it takes place
 that when it does take place you may believe that I am he. ","Truly
 truly
 I say to you
 he who receives any one whom I send receives me; and he who receives me receives him who sent me.\u201d","When Jesus had thus spoken
 he was troubled in spirit
 and testified
 \u201cTruly
 truly
 I say to you
 one of you will betray me.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cIt is he to whom I shall give this morsel when I have dipped it.\u201d So when he had dipped the morsel
 he gave it to Judas
 the son of Simon Iscariot. ","Then after the morsel
 Satan entered into him. Jesus said to him
 \u201cWhat you are going to do
 do quickly.\u201d ","When he had gone out
 Jesus said
 \u201cNow is the Son of man glorified
 and in him God is glorified; ","if God is glorified in him
 God will also glorify him in himself
 and glorify him at once. ","Little children
 yet a little while I am with you. You will seek me; and as I said to the Jews so now I say to you
 \u2018Where I am going you cannot come.\u2019 ","A new commandment I give to you
 that you love one another; even as I have loved you
 that you also love one another. ","By this all men will know that you are my disciples
 if you have love for one another.\u201d","Simon Peter said to him
 \u201cLord
 where are you going?\u201d Jesus answered
 \u201cWhere I am going you cannot follow me now; but you shall follow afterward.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cWill you lay down your life for me? Truly

 the cock will not crow
 till you have denied me three times.","\u201cLet not your hearts be troubled; believe  in God
 believe also in me. ","In my Father\u2019s house are many rooms; if it were not so
 would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you? ","And when I go and prepare a place for you
 I will come again and will take you to myself

 \u201cI am the way

 and the life; no one comes to the Father
 but by me. ","If you had known me
 you would have known my Father also; henceforth you know him and have seen him.\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cHave I been with you so long

 \u2018Show us the Father\u2019? ","Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own authority; but the Father who dwells in me does his works.","Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father in me; or else believe me for the sake of the works themselves.","\u201cTruly
 truly
 I say to you
 he who believes in me will also do the works that I do; and greater works than these will he do
 because I go to the Father. ","Whatever you ask in my name
 I will do it
 that the Father may be glorified in the Son; ","if you ask anything in my name
 I will do it.","\u201cIf you love me
 you will keep my commandments. ","And I will pray the Father
 and he will give you another Counselor
 to be with you for ever
 ","even the Spirit of truth
 whom the world cannot receive

 for he dwells with you
 and will be in you.","\u201cI will not leave you desolate; I will come to you.","Yet a little while
 and the world will see me no more
 but you will see me; because I live
 you will live also. ","In that day you will know that I am in my Father
 and you in me
 and I in you. ","He who has my commandments and keeps them
 he it is who loves me; and he who loves me will be loved by my Father
 and I will love him and manifest myself to him.\u201d ","Judas (not Iscariot) said to him
 \u201cLord
 how is it that you will manifest yourself to us
 and not to the world?\u201d ","Jesus answered him
 \u201cIf a man loves me
 he will keep my word
 and my Father will love him
 and we will come to him and make our home with him. ","He who does not love me does not keep my words; and the word which you hear is not mine but the Father\u2019s who sent me.","\u201cThese things I have spoken to you
 while I am still with you. ","But the Counselor
 the Holy Spirit
 whom the Father will send in my name
 he will teach you all things
 and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you. ","Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled
 neither let them be afraid. ","You heard me say to you
 \u2018I go away
 and I will come to you.\u2019 If you loved me
 you would have rejoiced
 because I go to the Father; for the Father is greater than I. ","And now I have told you before it takes place
 so that when it does take place
 you may believe. ","I will no longer talk much with you
 for the ruler of this world is coming. He has no power over me; ","but I do as the Father has commanded me
 so that the world may know that I love the Father. Rise
 let us go hence.","\u201cI am the true vine
 and my Father is the vinedresser. ","Every branch of mine that bears no fruit
 he takes away
 and every branch that does bear fruit he prunes
 that it may bear more fruit. ","You are already made clean by the word which I have spoken to you.","Abide in me
 and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself
 unless it abides in the vine
 neither can you
 unless you abide in me. ","I am the vine
 you are the branches. He who abides in me
 and I in him
 he it is that bears much fruit
 for apart from me you can do nothing. ","If a man does not abide in me
 he is cast forth as a branch and withers; and the branches are gathered
 thrown into the fire and burned. ","If you abide in me
 and my words abide in you
 ask whatever you will
 and it shall be done for you. ","By this my Father is glorified
 that you bear much fruit
 and so prove to be my disciples. ","As the Father has loved me
 so have I loved you; abide in my love. ","If you keep my commandments
 you will abide in my love
 just as I have kept my Father\u2019s commandments and abide in his love. ","These things I have spoken to you
 that my joy may be in you
 and that your joy may be full.","\u201cThis is my commandment
 that you love one another as I have loved you. ","Greater love has no man than this
 that a man lay down his life for his friends. ","You are my friends if you do what I command you.","No longer do I call you servants
 for the servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends
 for all that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you. ","You did not choose me
 but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide; so that whatever you ask the Father in my name
 he may give it to you. ","This I command you
 to love one another.","\u201cIf the world hates you
 know that it has hated me before it hated you. ","If you were of the world
 the world would love its own; but because you are not of the world
 but I chose you out of the world
 therefore the world hates you. ","Remember the word that I said to you
 \u2018A servant is not greater than his master.\u2019 If they persecuted me
 they will persecute you; if they kept my word
 they will keep yours also. ","But all this they will do to you on my account
 because they do not know him who sent me. ","If I had not come and spoken to them
 they would not have sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin. ","He who hates me hates my Father also.","If I had not done among them the works which no one else did
 they would not have sin; but now they have seen and hated both me and my Father. ","It is to fulfil the word that is written in their law
 \u2018They hated me without a cause.\u2019 ","But when the Counselor comes
 whom I shall send to you from the Father
 even the Spirit of truth
 who proceeds from the Father
 he will bear witness to me; ","and you also are witnesses
 because you have been with me from the beginning.","\u201cI have said all this to you to keep you from falling away.","They will put you out of the synagogues; indeed
 the hour is coming when whoever kills you will think he is offering service to God. ","And they will do this because they have not known the Father
 nor me. ","But I have said these things to you
 that when their hour comes you may remember that I told you of them. \u201cI did not say these things to you from the beginning
 because I was with you. ","But now I am going to him who sent me; yet none of you asks me
 \u2018Where are you going?\u2019 ","But because I have said these things to you
 sorrow has filled your hearts. ","Nevertheless I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away
 for if I do not go away
 the Counselor will not come to you; but if I go
 I will send him to you. ","And when he comes
 he will convince the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment: ","of sin
 because they do not believe in me; ","of righteousness
 because I go to the Father
 and you will see me no more; ","of judgment
 because the ruler of this world is judged.","\u201cI have yet many things to say to you
 but you cannot bear them now. ","When the Spirit of truth comes
 he will guide you into all the truth; for he will not speak on his own authority
 but whatever he hears he will speak
 and he will declare to you the things that are to come. ","He will glorify me
 for he will take what is mine and declare it to you. ","All that the Father has is mine; therefore I said that he will take what is mine and declare it to you.","\u201cA little while
 and you will see me no more; again a little while
 and you will see me.\u201d ","Some of his disciples said to one another
 \u201cWhat is this that he says to us
 \u2018A little while
 and you will not see me
 and again a little while
 and you will see me\u2019; and
 \u2018because I go to the Father\u2019?\u201d ","They said
 \u201cWhat does he mean by \u2018a little while\u2019? We do not know what he means.\u201d ","Jesus knew that they wanted to ask him; so he said to them
 \u201cIs this what you are asking yourselves
 what I meant by saying
 \u2018A little while
 and you will not see me
 and again a little while
 and you will see me\u2019? ","Truly
 truly
 I say to you
 you will weep and lament
 but the world will rejoice; you will be sorrowful
 but your sorrow will turn into joy. ","When a woman is in travail she has sorrow
 because her hour has come; but when she is delivered of the child
 she no longer remembers the anguish
 for joy that a child is born into the world. ","So you have sorrow now
 but I will see you again and your hearts will rejoice
 and no one will take your joy from you. ","In that day you will ask nothing of me. Truly
 truly
 I say to you
 if you ask anything of the Father
 he will give it to you in my name. ","Hitherto you have asked nothing in my name; ask
 and you will receive
 that your joy may be full.","\u201cI have said this to you in figures; the hour is coming when I shall no longer speak to you in figures but tell you plainly of the Father.","In that day you will ask in my name; and I do not say to you that I shall pray the Father for you;","for the Father himself loves you
 because you have loved me and have believed that I came from the Father. ","I came from the Father and have come into the world; again
 I am leaving the world and going to the Father.\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cDo you now believe? ","The hour is coming
 indeed it has come
 when you will be scattered
 every man to his home
 and will leave me alone; yet I am not alone
 for the Father is with me. ","I have said this to you
 that in me you may have peace. In the world you have tribulation; but be of good cheer
 I have overcome the world.\u201d","When Jesus had spoken these words
 he lifted up his eyes to heaven and said
 \u201cFather
 the hour has come; glorify thy Son that the Son may glorify thee
 ","since thou hast given him power over all flesh
 to give eternal life to all whom thou hast given him. ","And this is eternal life
 that they know thee the only true God
 and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent. ","I glorified thee on earth
 having accomplished the work which thou gavest me to do; ","and now
 Father
 glorify thou me in thy own presence with the glory which I had with thee before the world was made.","\u201cI have manifested thy name to the men whom thou gavest me out of the world; thine they were
 and thou gavest them to me
 and they have kept thy word. ","Now they know that everything that thou hast given me is from thee;","for I have given them the words which thou gavest me
 and they have received them and know in truth that I came from thee; and they have believed that thou didst send me. ","I am praying for them; I am not praying for the world but for those whom thou hast given me
 for they are thine; ","all mine are thine
 and thine are mine
 and I am glorified in them. ","And now I am no more in the world
 but they are in the world
 and I am coming to thee. Holy Father
 keep them in thy name
 which thou hast given me
 that they may be one
 even as we are one. ","While I was with them
 I kept them in thy name
 which thou hast given me; I have guarded them
 and none of them is lost but the son of perdition
 that the scripture might be fulfilled. ","But now I am coming to thee; and these things I speak in the world
 that they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves. ","I have given them thy word; and the world has hated them because they are not of the world
 even as I am not of the world. ","I do not pray that thou shouldst take them out of the world
 but that thou shouldst keep them from the evil one. ","They are not of the world
 even as I am not of the world. ","Sanctify them in the truth; thy word is truth.","As thou didst send me into the world
 so I have sent them into the world. ","And for their sake I consecrate myself
 that they also may be consecrated in truth.","\u201cI do not pray for these only
 but also for those who believe in me through their word
 ","that they may all be one; even as thou
 Father
 art in me
 and I in thee
 that they also may be in us
 so that the world may believe that thou hast sent me. ","The glory which thou hast given me I have given to them
 that they may be one even as we are one
 ","I in them and thou in me
 that they may become perfectly one
 so that the world may know that thou hast sent me and hast loved them even as thou hast loved me. ","Father
 I desire that they also
 whom thou hast given me
 may be with me where I am
 to behold my glory which thou hast given me in thy love for me before the foundation of the world. ","O righteous Father
 the world has not known thee
 but I have known thee; and these know that thou hast sent me. ","I made known to them thy name
 and I will make it known
 that the love with which thou hast loved me may be in them
 and I in them.\u201d","Then Jesus
 knowing all that was to befall him
 came forward and said to them
 \u201cWhom do you seek?\u201d ","They answered him
 \u201cJesus of Nazareth.\u201d Jesus said to them
 \u201cI am he.\u201d Judas
 who betrayed him
 was standing with them. ","When he said to them
 \u201cI am he
\u201d they drew back and fell to the ground. ","Again he asked them
 \u201cWhom do you seek?\u201d And they said
 \u201cJesus of Nazareth.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cI told you that I am he; so
 if you seek me
 let these men go.\u201d ","Jesus said to Peter
 \u201cPut your sword into its sheath; shall I not drink the cup which the Father has given me?\u201d","The maid who kept the door said to Peter
 \u201cAre not you also one of this man\u2019s disciples?\u201d He said
 \u201cI am not.\u201d ","Jesus answered him
 \u201cI have spoken openly to the world; I have always taught in synagogues and in the temple
 where all Jews come together; I have said nothing secretly. ","Why do you ask me? Ask those who have heard me
 what I said to them; they know what I said.\u201d ","Jesus answered him
 \u201cIf I have spoken wrongly
 bear witness to the wrong; but if I have spoken rightly
 why do you strike me?\u201d ","Pilate said to them
 \u201cTake him yourselves and judge him by your own law.\u201d The Jews said to him
 \u201cIt is not lawful for us to put any man to death.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cDo you say this of your own accord
 or did others say it to you about me?\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cMy kingship is not of this world; if my kingship were of this world
 my servants would fight
 that I might not be handed over to the Jews; but my kingship is not from the world.\u201d ","Pilate said to him
 \u201cSo you are a king?\u201d Jesus answered
 \u201cYou say that I am a king. For this I was born
 and for this I have come into the world
 to bear witness to the truth. Every one who is of the truth hears my voice.\u201d ","Pilate went out again
 and said to them
 \u201cBehold
 I am bringing him out to you
 that you may know that I find no crime in him.\u201d ","So Jesus came out
 wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them
 \u201cHere is the man!\u201d ","When the chief priests and the officers saw him
 they cried out
 \u201cCrucify him
 crucify him!\u201d Pilate said to them
 \u201cTake him yourselves and crucify him
 for I find no crime in him.\u201d ","Jesus answered him
 \u201cYou would have no power over me unless it had been given you from above; therefore he who delivered me to you has the greater sin.\u201d","Now it was the day of Preparation of the Passover; it was about the sixth hour. He said to the Jews
 \u201cHere is your King!\u201d ","When Jesus saw his mother
 and the disciple whom he loved standing near
 he said to his mother
 \u201cWoman
 behold
 your son!\u201d ","Then he said to the disciple
 \u201cBehold
 your mother!\u201d And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home.","After this Jesus
 knowing that all was now finished
 said (to fulfil the scripture)
 \u201cI thirst.\u201d ","When Jesus had received the vinegar
 he said
 \u201cIt is finished\u201d; and he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.","So she ran
 and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple
 the one whom Jesus loved
 and said to them
 \u201cThey have taken the Lord out of the tomb
 and we do not know where they have laid him.\u201d ","They said to her
 \u201cWoman
 why are you weeping?\u201d She said to them
 \u201cBecause they have taken away my Lord
 and I do not know where they have laid him.\u201d ","Jesus said to her
 \u201cWoman
 why are you weeping? Whom do you seek?\u201d Supposing him to be the gardener
 she said to him
 \u201cSir
 if you have carried him away
 tell me where you have laid him
 and I will take him away.\u201d ","Jesus said to her
 \u201cMary.\u201d She turned and said to him in Hebrew
 \u201cRab-bo\u2032ni!\u201d (which means Teacher). ","Jesus said to her
 \u201cDo not hold me
 for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to my brethren and say to them
 I am ascending to my Father and your Father
 to my God and your God.\u201d ","On the evening of that day
 the first day of the week
 the doors being shut where the disciples were
 for fear of the Jews
 Jesus came and stood among them and said to them
 \u201cPeace be with you.\u201d ","Jesus said to them again
 \u201cPeace be with you. As the Father has sent me
 even so I send you.\u201d ","And when he had said this
 he breathed on them
 and said to them
 \u201cReceive the Holy Spirit. ","If you forgive the sins of any
 they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any
 they are retained.\u201d","So the other disciples told him
 \u201cWe have seen the Lord.\u201d But he said to them
 \u201cUnless I see in his hands the print of the nails
 and place my finger in the mark of the nails
 and place my hand in his side
 I will not believe.\u201d","Eight days later
 his disciples were again in the house
 and Thomas was with them. The doors were shut
 but Jesus came and stood among them
 and said
 \u201cPeace be with you.\u201d ","Then he said to Thomas
 \u201cPut your finger here
 and see my hands; and put out your hand
 and place it in my side; do not be faithless
 but believing.\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cHave you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet believe.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cChildren
 have you any fish?\u201d They answered him
 \u201cNo.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cBring some of the fish that you have just caught.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cCome and have breakfast.\u201d Now none of the disciples dared ask him
 \u201cWho are you?\u201d They knew it was the Lord. ","When they had finished breakfast
 Jesus said to Simon Peter
 \u201cSimon
 son of John
 do you love me more than these?\u201d He said to him
 \u201cYes
 Lord; you know that I love you.\u201d He said to him
 \u201cFeed my lambs.\u201d ","A second time he said to him
 \u201cSimon
 son of John
 do you love me?\u201d He said to him
 \u201cYes
 Lord; you know that I love you.\u201d He said to him
 \u201cTend my sheep.\u201d ","He said to him the third time
 \u201cSimon
 son of John
 do you love me?\u201d Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time
 \u201cDo you love me?\u201d And he said to him
 \u201cLord
 you know everything; you know that I love you.\u201d Jesus said to him
 \u201cFeed my sheep. ","Truly
 truly
 I say to you
 when you were young
 you girded yourself and walked where you would; but when you are old
 you will stretch out your hands
 and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish to go.\u201d ","(This he said to show by what death he was to glorify God.) And after this he said to him
 \u201cFollow me.\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cIf it is my will that he remain until I come

 \u2018Pick up your mat and walk.\u2019\u201d","Afterwards
 Yeshua finds him in the Temple. He said to him
 \u201cLook
 you\u2019ve been healed! Stop sinning
 so nothing worse happens to you.\u201d","But Yeshua said to them
 \u201cMy Father is still working
 and I also am working.\u201d","Therefore Yeshua answered them
 \u201cAmen
 amen I tell you
 the Son cannot do anything by Himself. He can do only what He sees the Father doing. Whatever the Father does
 the Son does likewise.","For the Father loves the Son and shows Him everything He does. He will show Him even greater works than these
 so that you will be amazed.","For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life
 so also the Son gives life to whomever He wants.","The Father does not judge anyone
 but has handed over all judgment to the Son","so that all should honor the Son
 just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him.","\u201cAmen
 amen I tell you
 whoever hears My word and trusts the One who sent Me has eternal life. He does not come into judgment
 but has passed over from death into life.","Amen
 amen I tell you
 an hour is coming and is now here
 when the dead will hear the voice of Ben-Elohim. Those who hear will live!","For just as the Father has life in Himself
 so also He has granted the Son to have life in Himself.","Also He has given the Son authority to judge
 because He is the Son of Man.","\u201cDo not be amazed at this
 for an hour is coming when all who are in their graves will hear His voice","and come out! Those who have done good will come to a resurrection of life
 and those who have done evil will come to a resurrection of judgment.","I can do nothing on My own. Just as I hear
 I judge; and My judgment is just
 for I do not seek My own will
 but the will of the One who sent Me.\u201d","\u201cIf I testify about Myself
 My witness is not valid.","There is another who testifies about Me
 and I know that the testimony He gives is true.","You have sent to John
 and he has testified to the truth.","I do not receive the testimony of man
 but I say these things so that you may be saved.","He was the lamp that was burning and shining
 and you wanted to rejoice for a while in his light.","\u201cBut the testimony I have is greater than that from John. The works the Father has given Me to finish\u2014the very works I am doing\u2014testify about Me
 that the Father has sent Me.","And the Father who sent Me has testified concerning Me. You have never heard His voice nor seen His form.","Nor do you have His Word living in you
 because you do not trust the One He sent.","You search the Scriptures because you suppose that in them you have eternal life. It is these that testify about Me.","Yet you are unwilling to come to Me so that you may have life!","\u201cI do not accept glory from men.","But I know you
 that you do not have the love of God in yourselves.","I have come in My Father\u2019s name
 and you do not receive Me. But if another comes in his own name
 you will receive him.","How can you believe
 when you receive glory from one another and you do not seek the glory that comes from God alone?","\u201cDo not think that I will accuse you before the Father. The one who accuses you is Moses
 in whom you have put your hope.","For if you were believing Moses
 you would believe Me\u2014because he wrote about Me.","But since you do not believe his writings
 how will you believe My words?\u201d","Lifting up His eyes and seeing a large crowd coming to Him
 Yeshua said to Philip
 \u201cWhere will we buy bread so these may eat?\u201d","Yeshua said
 \u201cMake the people recline.\u201d There was much grass in the area. So the men reclined
 about five thousand in number.","When the people were full
 Yeshua said to His disciples
 \u201cGather up the leftovers
 so nothing is wasted.\u201d","But Yeshua says to them
 \u201cI am. Don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d","Yeshua responded to them
 \u201cAmen
 amen I tell you
 you seek Me not because you saw signs
 but because you ate all the bread and were filled.","Don\u2019t work for food that spoils
 but for the food that endures to eternal life
 which the Son of Man will give to you. For on Him
 God the Father has put the seal of approval.\u201d","Yeshua answered them
 \u201cThis is the work of God
 to trust in the One He sent.\u201d","Yeshua answered them
 \u201cAmen
 amen I tell you
 it isn\u2019t Moses who has given you bread from heaven
 but My Father gives you the true bread from heaven.","For the bread of God is the One coming down from heaven and giving life to the world.\u201d","Yeshua said to them
 \u201cI am the bread of life. Whoever comes to Me will never be hungry
 and whoever believes in Me will never be thirsty.","But I told you that you have seen Me
 yet you do not believe.","Everyone the Father gives Me will come to Me
 and anyone coming to Me I will never reject.","For I have come down from heaven not to do My own will but the will of the One who sent Me.","\u201cNow this is the will of the One who sent Me
 that I lose not one of all He has given Me
 but raise each one on the last day.","For this is the will of My Father
 that everyone who sees the Son and trusts in Him may have eternal life; and I will raise him up on the last day.\u201d","Yeshua answered
 \u201cStop grumbling among yourselves!","No one can come to Me unless My Father who sent Me draws him\u2014and I will raise him up on the last day.","It is written in the Prophets
 \u2018They will all be taught by God.\u2019 Everyone who has listened and learned from the Father comes to Me.","Not that anyone has seen the Father except the One who is from God\u2014He has seen the Father.","\u201cAmen
 amen I tell you
 he who believes has eternal life.","I am the bread of life.","Your fathers ate the manna in the desert
 yet they died.","This is the bread that comes down from heaven
 so that one may eat and not die.","I am the living bread
 which came down from heaven. If anyone eats this bread
 he will live forever. This bread is My flesh
 which I will give for the life of the world.\u201d","So Yeshua said to them
 \u201cAmen
 amen I tell you
 unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood
 you have no life in yourselves.","He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life
 and I will raise him up on the last day.","\u201cFor My flesh is real food and My blood is real drink.","He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me
 and I in him.","Just as the living Father sent Me and I live because of the Father
 so the one who eats of Me will also live because of Me.","This is the bread that came down from heaven\u2014not like the bread your fathers ate and then died. He who eats this bread will live forever.\u201d","But Yeshua knew His disciples were murmuring
 so He said to them
 \u201cDoes this offend you?","Then what if you see the Son of Man going back up to the place where He was before?","It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh is of no benefit. The words I have spoken to you are Spirit and are life!","Yet some of you do not trust.\u201d Yeshua knew from the beginning who were the ones who did not trust
 as well as which one would betray Him.","Then He told them
 \u201cFor this reason I\u2019ve told you that no one can come to Me unless it has been granted to him by the Father.\u201d","So Yeshua said to the Twelve
 \u201cYou don\u2019t want to leave also
 do you?\u201d","Yeshua answered them
 \u201cDidn\u2019t I choose you
 the Twelve? Yet one of you is the adversary!\u201d","Therefore His brothers said to Him
 \u201cLeave here and go to Judea
 so Your disciples also may see the works You are doing.","Therefore Yeshua said to them
 \u201cMy time has not yet come
 but your time is always at hand.","The world cannot hate you
 but it hates Me because I testify that its works are evil.","You go on up to the Feast. I\u2019m not going to this feast
 because My time hasn\u2019t yet fully come.\u201d","Yeshua answered
 \u201cMy teaching is not from Me
 but from Him who sent Me.","If anyone wants to do His will
 he will know whether My teaching comes from God or it is Myself speaking.","Whoever speaks from himself seeks his own glory; but He who seeks the glory of the One who sent Him
 He is true and there is no unrighteousness in Him.","Hasn\u2019t Moses given you the Torah? Yet none of you keeps it. Why are you trying to kill Me?\u201d","Yeshua answered
 \u201cI did one good work
 and all of you are amazed.","Because Moses has given you circumcision (though it is not from Moses
 but from the patriarchs)
 you circumcise a man on Shabbat.","If a man receives circumcision on Shabbat so that the Torah of Moses may not be broken
 why are you angry that I healed a man\u2019s whole body on Shabbat?","Do not judge by appearance
 but judge righteously.\u201d","Then some of the people from Jerusalem were saying
 \u201cIsn\u2019t this the person they\u2019re trying to kill?","Then
 while teaching in the Temple courts
 Yeshua cried out
 \u201cYou know both who I am and where I am from! I have not come on My own
 but the One who sent Me is true. You do not know Him
","but I know Him because I am from Him and He sent Me.\u201d","Yeshua said
 \u201cI am with you only a little while longer
 and then I am going to the One who sent Me.","You will look for Me but will not find Me. Where I am
 you cannot come.\u201d","The Judean leaders then said among themselves
 \u201cWhere is this person about to go that we shall not find Him? He\u2019s not going to the Diaspora to teach the Greeks
 is He?","On the last and greatest day of the Feast
 Yeshua stood up and cried out loudly
 \u201cIf anyone is thirsty
 let him come to Me and drink.","Whoever believes in Me
 as the Scripture says
 \u2018out of his innermost being will flow rivers of living water.\u2019\u201d","Now He said this about the Ruach
 whom those who trusted in Him were going to receive; for the Ruach was not yet given
 since Yeshua was not yet glorified.","they say to Yeshua
 \u201cTeacher
 this woman has been caught in the act of committing adultery.","When they kept asking Him
 He stood up and said
 \u201cThe sinless one among you
 let him be the first to throw a stone at her.\u201d","Straightening up
 Yeshua said to her
 \u201cWoman
 where are they? Did no one condemn you?\u201d","\u201cNo one
 Sir
\u201d she said. \u201cThen neither do I condemn you
\u201d Yeshua said. \u201cGo
 and sin no more.\u201d","Yeshua spoke to them again
 saying
 \u201cI am the light of the world. The one who follows Me will no longer walk in darkness
 but will have the light of life.\u201d","Yeshua answered them
 \u201cEven if I testify about Myself
 My testimony is valid. For I know where I came from and where I am going. But you don\u2019t know where I come from or where I am going.","You judge according to the flesh
 but I do not judge anyone.","Yet even if I do judge
 My judgment is true
 because it is not I alone but I with the Father who sent Me.","Even in your Torah it is written that the testimony of two men is true.","I am one witness for Myself
 and the Father who sent Me bears witness for Me.\u201d","Then they said to Him
 \u201cWhere is your Father?\u201d Yeshua answered
 \u201cYou know neither Me nor My Father. If you knew Me
 you would also know My Father.\u201d","Then again Yeshua spoke to them
 \u201cI am going away. You will look for Me and die in your sin. Where I am going
 you cannot come.\u201d","Yeshua said
 \u201cYou are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world.","Therefore I told you that you will die in your sins. If you don\u2019t believe that I am
 you will die in your sins.\u201d","So they asked Him
 \u201cWho are you?\u201d Yeshua replied
 \u201cWhat have I been telling you from the beginning?","I have much to say and judge about you. But the One who sent Me is true
 and I tell the world what I heard from Him.\u201d","So Yeshua said
 \u201cWhen you have lifted up the Son of Man
 then you will know who I am. I do nothing by Myself
 but speak just what the Father has taught Me.","The One who sent Me is with Me. He has not left Me alone
 because I always do what is pleasing to Him.\u201d","Then Yeshua said to the Judeans who had trusted Him
 \u201cIf you abide in My word
 then you are truly My disciples.","You will know the truth
 and the truth will set you free!\u201d","Yeshua answered them
 \u201cAmen
 amen I tell you
 everyone who sins is a slave to sin.","Now the slave does not remain in the household forever; the son abides forever.","So if the Son sets you free
 you will be free indeed!","I know you are Abraham\u2019s children; yet you are trying to kill Me
 because My word has no place in you.","I tell of what I have seen with the Father; so also you do what you heard from the Father.\u201d","\u201cAbraham is our father
\u201d they replied to Him. Yeshua said to them
 \u201cIf you are Abraham\u2019s children
 do the deeds of Abraham.","But now you are seeking to kill Me\u2014a Man who has told you the truth
 which I heard from God. This Abraham did not do!","You are doing the deeds of your father.\u201d They said to Him
 \u201cWe were not born as illegitimate children\u2014we have one Father
 God Himself!\u201d","Yeshua said to them
 \u201cIf God were your Father
 you would love Me
 for from God I came and now I am here. For I have not come on My own
 but He sent Me.","Why don\u2019t you understand My speech? Because you\u2019re not able to hear My word!","You are of your father the devil
 and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth
 because there is no truth in him. Whenever he speaks lies he is just being himself\u2014for he is a liar and the father of lies.","\u201cBut because I speak the truth
 you do not believe Me.","Which one of you convicts Me of sinning? If I am telling the truth
 why don\u2019t you believe Me?","He who belongs to God hears the words of God. The reason you don\u2019t hear is because you do not belong to God.\u201d","Yeshua answered
 \u201cI do not have a demon! I honor My Father
 yet you dishonor Me.","But I do not seek My own glory; there is One who is seeking and judging.","Amen
 amen I tell you
 if anyone keeps My word
 he will never see death.\u201d","\u201cNow we know You have a demon!\u201d the Judean leaders said to Him. \u201cAbraham and the prophets died. Yet You say
 \u2018If anyone keeps My word
 he will never taste death.\u2019","Yeshua answered
 \u201cIf I glorify Myself
 My glory is nothing. It is My Father who gives Me glory\u2014the One of whom you say
 \u2018He is our God.\u2019","Yet you do not know Him
 but I know Him. If I say I do not know Him
 I will be a liar like you. Yet I do know Him and keep His Word.","Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day; he saw it and was thrilled.\u201d","Yeshua answered
 \u201cAmen
 amen I tell you
 before Abraham was
 I am!\u201d","Yeshua answered
 \u201cNeither this man nor his parents sinned. This happened so that the works of God might be brought to light in him.","We must do the work of the One who sent Me
 so long as it is day! Night is coming when no one can work.","While I am in the world
 I am the light of the world.\u201d","He told him
 \u201cGo
 wash in the Pool of Siloam\u201d (which is translated Sent). So he went away
 washed
 and came back seeing.","He answered
 \u201cThe Man who is called Yeshua made mud
 rubbed it on my eyes
 and said to me
 \u2018Go to Siloam and wash.\u2019 So I went away and washed
 and then I received my sight!\u201d","\u201cWhere is He?\u201d they asked him. \u201cI don\u2019t know
\u201d he said.","So a second time they called the man who had been blind and said
 \u201cGive glory to God! We know that this man is a sinner!\u201d","The man replied
 \u201cI don\u2019t know whether He\u2019s a sinner. One thing I do know is that I was blind
 but now I see!\u201d","So they asked him
 \u201cWhat did He do to you? How did He open your eyes?\u201d","\u201cI told you already and you didn\u2019t listen!\u201d the man responded. \u201cWhat
 do you want to hear it again? You don\u2019t want to become His disciples too
 do you?\u201d","Yeshua heard that they had thrown him out. Finding him
 He said
 \u201cDo you believe in the Son of Man?\u201d","Yeshua said
 \u201cYou have seen Him\u2014He is the One speaking with you.\u201d","Yeshua said
 \u201cFor judgment I came into this world
 so that those who don\u2019t see may see
 and the ones who do see may become blind.\u201d","Yeshua said to them
 \u201cIf you were blind
 you would have no sin. But now you say
 \u2018We see.\u2019 So your sin remains.\u201d","\u201cAmen
 amen I tell you
 he who does not enter the sheepfold by the door
 but climbs in some other way
 is a thief and a robber.","But he who enters through the door is the shepherd of the sheep.","To him the doorkeeper opens
 and the sheep hear his voice. The shepherd calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.","\u201cWhen he has brought out all his own
 he goes ahead of them; and the sheep follow him because they know his voice.","They will never follow a stranger
 but will run away from him
 for they do not know the voice of strangers.\u201d","So Yeshua said again
 \u201cAmen
 amen I tell you
 I am the gate for the sheep.","All those who came before Me are thieves and robbers
 but the sheep did not listen to them.","I am the gate! If anyone comes in through Me
 he will be saved. He will come and go and find pasture.","The thief comes only to steal
 slaughter
 and destroy. I have come that they might have life
 and have it abundantly!","\u201cI am the Good Shepherd. The Good Shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.","The hired worker is not the shepherd
 and the sheep are not his own. He sees the wolf coming and abandons the sheep and flees. Then the wolf snatches and scatters the sheep.","The man is only a hired hand and does not care about the sheep.","\u201cI am the Good Shepherd. I know My own and My own know Me
","just as the Father knows Me and I know the Father. And I lay down My life for the sheep.","I have other sheep that are not from this fold; those also I must lead
 and they will listen to My voice. So there shall be one flock
 one Shepherd.","\u201cFor this reason the Father loves Me
 because I lay down My life
 so that I may take it up again.","No one takes it away from Me
 but I lay it down on My own. I have the authority to lay it down
 and I have the authority to take it up again. This command I received from My Father.\u201d","Yeshua answered them
 \u201cI told you
 but you don\u2019t believe! The works I do in My Father\u2019s name testify concerning Me.","But you don\u2019t believe
 because you are not My sheep.","My sheep hear My voice. I know them
 and they follow Me.","I give them eternal life! They will never perish
 and no one will snatch them out of My hand.","My Father
 who has given them to Me
 is greater than all. And no one is able to snatch them out of the Father\u2019s hand.","I and the Father are one.\u201d","Yeshua answered them
 \u201cI\u2019ve shown you many good works from the Father. For which of these are you going to stone Me?\u201d","Yeshua answered them
 \u201cIsn\u2019t it written in your Writings
 \u2018I have said you are gods\u2019?","If he called them \u2018gods
\u2019 to whom the Word of God came (and the Scripture cannot be broken)
","do you say of Him
 the One the Father set apart and sent into the world
 \u2018You speak blasphemy
\u2019 because I said
 \u2018I am Ben-Elohim\u2019?","\u201cIf I don\u2019t do the works of My Father
 don\u2019t believe Me!","But if I do
 even if you don\u2019t trust Me
 trust the deeds. Then you may come to know and continue to understand that the Father is in Me
 and I am in the Father.\u201d","When Yeshua heard this
 He said
 \u201cThis sickness will not end in death. It is for God\u2019s glory
 so that Ben-Elohim may be glorified through it.\u201d","Then after this
 He said to His disciples
 \u201cLet\u2019s go up to Judea again.\u201d","Yeshua answered
 \u201cAren\u2019t there twelve hours in the day? If a man walks in the day
 he doesn\u2019t stumble
 because he sees the light of the world.","But if a man should walk around at night
 he stumbles
 because the light is not in him.\u201d","After He said this
 He tells them
 \u201cOur friend Lazarus has fallen asleep
 but I\u2019m going there to wake him up.\u201d","Then Yeshua told them clearly
 \u201cLazarus is dead!","I\u2019m glad for your sake I wasn\u2019t there
 so that you may believe. Anyway
 let\u2019s go to him!\u201d","Then Thomas called the Twin said to the other disciples
 \u201cLet\u2019s go too
 so that we may die with Him!\u201d","Yeshua said to her
 \u201cYour brother will rise again.\u201d","Yeshua said to her
 \u201cI am the resurrection and the life! Whoever believes in Me
 even if he dies
 shall live.","And whoever lives and believes in Me shall never die. Do you believe this?\u201d","She says to Him
 \u201cYes
 Lord
 I believe that you are the Messiah
 Ben-Elohim who has come into the world.\u201d","So when Miriam came to where Yeshua was
 she saw Him and fell at His feet
 saying to Him
 \u201cMaster
 if You had been here
 my brother would not have died!\u201d","\u201cWhere have you laid him?\u201d He asked. \u201cCome and see
 Master
\u201d they tell Him.","Yeshua says
 \u201cRoll away the stone!\u201d Martha
 the dead man\u2019s sister
 said to Him
 \u201cMaster
 by this time he stinks! He\u2019s been dead for four days!\u201d","Yeshua says to her
 \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you that if you believed
 you would see the glory of God?\u201d","So they rolled away the stone. Yeshua lifted up His eyes and said
 \u201cFather
 I thank you that you have heard Me.","I knew that You always hear Me; but because of this crowd standing around I said it
 so that they may believe that You sent Me.\u201d","And when He had said this
 He cried out with a loud voice
 \u201cLazarus
 come out!\u201d","He who had been dead came out
 wrapped in burial clothes binding his hands and feet
 with a cloth over his face. And Yeshua tells them
 \u201cCut him loose
 and let him go!\u201d","Therefore Yeshua said
 \u201cLeave her alone! She set it aside for the day of My burial.","You will always have the poor among you
 but you will not always have Me.\u201d","So the crowd
 which had been with Yeshua when He called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead
 kept on telling everyone about it.","So the Pharisees said to each other
 \u201cYou see that you can\u2019t do anything. Look
 the whole world has taken off after Him!\u201d","These came to Philip
 who was from Bethsaida in the Galilee. \u201cSir
\u201d they said
 \u201cwe want to see Yeshua.\u201d","Yeshua answers them
 saying
 \u201cThe hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified!","Amen
 amen I tell you
 unless a grain of wheat falls to the earth and dies
 it remains alone. But if it dies
 it produces much fruit.","He who loves his life will lose it
 and the one who hates his life in this world will keep it forever.","If any man serves Me
 he must follow Me; and where I am
 there also will My servant be. If anyone serves Me
 the Father will honor him.","\u201cNow My soul is troubled. And what shall I say? \u2018Father
 save Me from this hour\u2019? But it was for this reason I came to this hour.","Father
 glorify Your name!\u201d Then a voice came out of heaven
 \u201cI have glorified it
 and again I will glorify it!\u201d","Yeshua responded
 \u201cThis voice hasn\u2019t come for My sake
 but for yours.","Now is the judgment of this world! Now the prince of this world will be driven out!","And as I am lifted up from the earth
 I will draw all to Myself.\u201d","Therefore Yeshua said to them
 \u201cThe light is with you for a little longer. Walk while you have the light
 so that the darkness will not overtake you. The one who walks in darkness doesn\u2019t know where he is going.","While you have the light
 believe in the light so that you may become sons of light.\u201d Yeshua spoke these things
 then left and hid Himself from them.","Yeshua cried out
 \u201cWhoever puts trust in Me believes not in Me but in the One who sent Me!","And whoever beholds Me beholds the One who sent Me.","As light I have come into the world
 so that everyone who trusts in Me should not remain in darkness.","\u201cIf anyone hears My words but doesn\u2019t keep them
 I do not judge him; for I came to save the world
 not to judge the world.","The one who rejects Me and doesn\u2019t receive My words has a judge; the word I spoke will judge him on the last day.","For I did not speak on My own
 but the Father Himself who sent Me has commanded Me what to say and speak.","And I know that His commandment is life everlasting. Therefore what I say
 I say just as the Father has told Me.\u201d","Yeshua responded
 \u201cYou don\u2019t know what I am doing now
 but you will understand after these things.\u201d","Peter said to Him
 \u201cYou shall never wash my feet!\u201d Yeshua answered him
 \u201cIf I don\u2019t wash you
 you have no part with Me.\u201d","Yeshua said to him
 \u201cHe who has bathed has no need to wash
 except the feet; he is completely clean. And you all are clean
 though not every one.\u201d","He knew who was betraying Him; for this reason
 He said
 \u201cNot all of you are clean.\u201d","So after He had washed their feet and put His robe back on and reclined again
 He said to them
 \u201cDo you understand what I have done for you?","You call Me \u2018Teacher\u2019 and \u2018Master\u2019\u2014and rightly you say
 for I am.","So if I
 your Master and Teacher
 have washed your feet
 you also ought to wash each other\u2019s feet.","I have given you an example\u2014you should do for each other what I have done for you.","\u201cAmen
 amen I tell you
 a servant isn\u2019t greater than his master

 you are blessed if you do them!\u201d","\u201cI am not speaking to all of you\u2014I know whom I have chosen. But so the Scripture may be fulfilled

 before it happens
 so that when it happens you may believe that I am.","Amen
 amen I tell you

 receives Me; and he who receives Me
 receives the One who sent Me.\u201d","After He said these things
 Yeshua was agitated in spirit and testified
 \u201cAmen

 \u201cIt\u2019s the one I will give this bit of matzah to

 He takes it and gives it to Judah from Kriot

 satan entered into him. Then Yeshua tells him
 \u201cWhat you\u2019re about to do
 do quickly!\u201d","Then when Judah had gone out

 you cannot produce fruit unless you abide in Me.","\u201cI am the vine; you are the branches. The one who abides in Me
 and I in him
 bears much fruit; for apart from Me
 you can do nothing.","If anyone does not abide in Me

 that you love one another just as I have loved you.","No one has greater love than this: that he lay down his life for his friends.","You are My friends if you do what I command you.","\u201cI am no longer calling you servants
 for the servant does not know what his master is doing. Now I have called you friends
 because everything I have heard from My Father I have made known to you.","\u201cYou did not choose Me
 but I chose you. I selected you so that you would go and produce fruit

 so that you may love one another.\u201d","\u201cIf the world hates you
 know that it has hated Me before you.","If you were of the world

 they will persecute you also. If they kept My word
 they will keep yours also.","\u201cBut all these things they will do to you for the sake of My name
 because they do not know the One who sent Me.","If I had not come and spoken to them
 they would have no sin. But now they have no excuse for their sin.","\u201cHe who hates Me also hates My Father.","If I had not done works among them that no one else did
 they would have no sin. But now they have seen and have hated both Me and My Father.","So is fulfilled the word written in their Scripture

 and not one of you is asking Me
 \u2018Where are you going?\u2019","Because I have spoken these things to you

 it is to your advantage that I go away! For if I do not go away
 the Helper will not come to you; but if I go
 I will send Him to you.","\u201cWhen He comes
 He will convict the world about sin
 righteousness
 and judgment:","concerning sin
 because they do not believe in Me;","concerning righteousness
 because I am going to the Father and you will no longer see Me;","and concerning judgment
 because the ruler of this world has been judged.","\u201cI still have much more to tell you
 but you cannot handle it just now.","But when the Spirit of truth comes
 He will guide you into all the truth. He will not speak on His own; but whatever He hears

 you will see Me\u2019?","Amen
 amen I tell you
 you will weep and mourn
 but the world will celebrate. You will be filled with sorrow
 but your sorrow will turn to joy!","\u201cWhen a woman is in labor
 she has pain because her hour has come. But when she gives birth to the child

 because of the joy that a human being has been born into the world.","So also you have sorrow now; but I will see you again
 and your heart will rejoice
 and no one will take your joy away from you!","\u201cIn that day
 you will ask Me nothing. Amen

 He will give you.","Up to now
 you have not asked for anything in My name. Ask and you will receive
 so that your joy may be full.","\u201cThese things I have spoken to you in metaphors. An hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in metaphors

 you will ask in My name\u2014and I\u2019m not telling you that I will ask the Father on your behalf.","For the Father Himself loves you
 because you have loved Me and have believed that I came forth from God.","I came forth from the Father and have come into the world. Again I am leaving the world and going to the Father.\u201d","Yeshua answered them
 \u201cDo you now believe?","Look
 the hour is coming\u2014indeed has come\u2014when you will be scattered
 each to his own

 because the Father is with Me.","These things I have spoken to you
 so that in Me you may have shalom. In the world you will have trouble
 but take heart! I have overcome the world!\u201d","Yeshua spoke these things; then
 lifting up His eyes to heaven
 He said
 \u201cFather

 I have given to them. They received them and truly understood that I came from You

 knowing all the things coming upon Him
 went forward. He said to them
 \u201cWho are you looking for?\u201d","\u201cYeshua ha-Natzrati

 \u201cI am
\u201d they drew back and fell to the ground.","So again He asked them
 \u201cWho are you looking for?\u201d And they said
 \u201cYeshua ha-Natzrati.\u201d","Yeshua answered
 \u201cI told you
 I am! If you\u2019re looking for Me
 let these men go their way.\u201d","So Yeshua said to Peter
 \u201cPut the sword into the sheath! The cup the Father has given Me\u2014shall I never drink it?\u201d","The maidservant at the door says to Peter
 \u201cAren\u2019t you one of this Man\u2019s disciples too?\u201d He says
 \u201cNo

 where all the Jewish people come together. I spoke nothing in secret.","Why question Me? Ask those who have heard what I spoke to them. Look
 they know what I said.\u201d","Yeshua answered him
 \u201cIf I have spoken wrongly
 give evidence of the wrong; but if rightly
 why hit Me?\u201d","Then Pilate said to them
 \u201cTake Him yourselves
 and judge Him by your Torah!\u201d The Judean leaders responded
 \u201cWe are not authorized to put anyone to death.\u201d","\u201cAre you saying this on your own
\u201d Yeshua answered
 \u201cor did others tell you about Me?\u201d","Yeshua answered
 \u201cMy kingdom is not of this world. If My kingdom were of this world
 then My servants would be fighting so that I wouldn\u2019t be handed over to the Judean leaders. But as it is
 My kingdom is not from here.\u201d","So Pilate said to Him
 \u201cAre you a king
 then?\u201d Yeshua answered
 \u201cYou say that I am a king. For this reason I was born
 and for this reason I came into the world
 so that I might testify to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears My voice.\u201d","Pilate came out again. He said to them

 the Man!\u201d Pilate said to them.","When the ruling kohanim and officers saw Him

 \u201cTake Him yourselves and execute Him! For I don\u2019t find a case against Him.\u201d","Yeshua answered
 \u201cYou would have no authority over Me if it hadn\u2019t been given to you from above. For this reason
 the one who handed Me over to you has the greater sin.\u201d","It was the Day of Preparation for Passover
 about the sixth hour. And Pilate said to the Judean leaders
 \u201cBehold
 your king!\u201d","Yeshua saw His mother and the disciple whom He loved standing nearby. He tells His mother

 the first of the week. When the doors were locked where the disciples were

 nor whither he goeth; so is each man that is born of the Spirit. ","Jesus answered
 and said to him
 Thou art a master in Israel
 and knowest not these things? [Jesus answered
 and said to him
 Art thou a master in Israel
 and knowest not these things?] ","Truly
 truly
 I say to thee
 for we speak that that we know
 and we witness that that we have seen
 and ye take not our witnessing. ","If I have said to you earthly things
 and ye believe not
 how if I say to you heavenly things
 shall ye believe? ","And no man ascendeth [up] into heaven
 but he that came down from heaven
 man's Son that is in heaven. [And no man ascendeth into heaven
 no but he that came down from heaven
 the Son of man which is in heaven.] ","And as Moses areared a serpent in desert [And as Moses reared up a serpent in desert]
 so it behooveth man's Son to be raised [up]
 ","that each man that believeth in him
 perish not
 but have everlasting life. ","For God loved so the world [Forsooth God so loved the world]
 that he gave his one begotten Son
 that each man that believeth in him perish not
 but have everlasting life. ","For God sent not his Son into the world
 that he judge the world
 but that the world be saved by him. ","He that believeth in him
 is not deemed; but he that believeth not
 is now deemed [He that believeth into him is not deemed
 or condemned; forsooth he that believeth not
 is now condemned]
 for he believeth not in the name of the one begotten Son of God. ","And this is the doom
 for light came into the world
 and men loved more darknesses than light; for their works were evil. ","For each man that doeth evil
 hateth the light; and he cometh not to the light [and cometh not to the light]
 that his works be not reproved. ","But he that doeth truth
 cometh to the light
 that his works be showed
 that they be done in God. ","And they came to John
 and said to him
 Master [Rabbi
 or Master]
 he that was with thee beyond Jordan
 to whom thou hast borne witnessing
 lo! he baptizeth
 and all men come to him. ","And a woman came from Samaria
 to draw water. And Jesus saith to her
 Give me [to] drink. ","Jesus answered
 and said to her
 If thou knewest the gift of God
 and who it is
 that saith to thee
 Give me [to] drink
 thou peradventure wouldest have asked of him
 and he should have given to thee quick water. ","Jesus answered
 and said to her
 Each man that drinketh of this water
 shall thirst again; ","but he that drinketh of the water that I shall give him
 shall not thirst without end [shall not thirst into without end]; but the water that I shall give him
 shall be made in him a well of water
 springing up into everlasting life. ","The woman saith to him
 Sire
 give me this water
 that I thirst not
 neither come hither to draw. ","Jesus saith to her
 Go
 call thine husband
 and come hither. ","The woman answered
 and said
 I have none husband [I have not an husband]. Jesus saith to her
 Thou saidest well
 That I have none husband [For I have not an husband];","for thou hast had five husbands
 and he that thou hast
 is not thine husband [and he whom thou hast now
 is not thine husband]. This thing thou saidest soothly. ","Jesus saith to her
 Woman
 believe thou to me
 for the hour shall come
 when neither in this hill
 neither in Jerusalem [nor in Jerusalem]
 ye shall worship the Father. ","Ye worship that that ye know not; we worship that that we know; for health is of the Jews.","But the time is come [But the hour cometh]
 and now it is
 when true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth; for also the Father seeketh such
 that worship him. ","God is a Spirit
 and it behooveth them that worship him
 to worship in spirit and truth. ","Jesus saith to her
 I am he
 that speaketh with thee. [Jesus saith to her
 I am
 that speak with thee.] ","But he said to them
 I have meat to eat
 that ye know not. ","Jesus saith to them
 My meat is
 that I do the will of him that sent me
 [and] that I perform the work of him. ","Whether ye say not
 that yet four months be
 and ripe corn cometh? Lo! I say to you
 lift up your eyes
 and see ye the fields
 for now they be white to reap. ","And he that reapeth taketh hire
 and gathereth fruit into everlasting life; that both he that soweth
 and he that reapeth
 have joy together. ","In this thing is the word true
 For one is that soweth
 and another that reapeth. ","I sent you to reap
 that that ye have not travailed; other men have travailed
 and ye have entered into their travails. ","and said to the woman
 That now not for thy speech we believe; for we have heard
 and we know
 that this is verily the Saviour of the world. ","Therefore Jesus said to him
 But ye see tokens and great wonders
 ye believe not. ","Jesus saith to him
 Go
 thy son liveth. The man believed to the word
 that Jesus said to him
 and he went.","And he asked of them the hour
 in which he was amended. And they said to him
 For yesterday in the seventh hour the fever left him. ","Therefore the father knew
 that that hour it was
 in which Jesus said to him
 Thy son liveth; and he believed
 and all his house. ","And when Jesus had seen him lying
 and had known
 that he had much time [and had known
 for now he had much time]
 he saith to him
 Wilt thou be made whole? ","Jesus saith to him
 Rise up
 take thy bed
 and go. [Jesus saith to him
 Rise up
 take thy bed
 and wander.] ","He answered to them
 He that made me whole
 said to me
 Take thy bed
 and go [Take thy bed
 and wander]. ","Afterward Jesus found him in the temple
 and said to him
 Lo! thou art made whole; now do not thou do sin [now do not thou sin]
 lest any worse thing befall to thee. ","And Jesus answered to them
 My Father worketh till now
 and I work. ","Therefore Jesus answered
 and said to them
 Truly
 truly
 I say to you
 the Son may not of himself do any thing
 but that thing that he seeth the Father doing; for whatever things he doeth
 the Son doeth in like manner those things [whatever things soothly he doeth
 these things and the Son also doeth]. ","For the Father loveth the Son
 and showeth to him all things that he doeth; and he shall show to him greater works than these
 that ye wonder. ","For as the Father raiseth dead men
 and quickeneth
 [and] so the Son quickeneth whom he will. ","For neither the Father judgeth any man
 but hath given every doom to the Son [but hath given all the doom to the Son]
 ","that all men honour the Son
 as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son
 honoureth not the Father that sent him. ","Truly
 truly
 I say to you
 that he that heareth my word
 and believeth in him that sent me
 hath everlasting life
 and he cometh not into doom
 but passeth from death into life [hath everlasting life
 and cometh not into doom
 but passed from death into life]. ","Truly
 truly
 I say to you
 for the hour cometh
 and now it is
 when dead men shall hear the voice of the Son of God
 and they that hear
 shall live. ","For as the Father hath life in himself
 so he gave to the Son
 to have life in himself; ","and he gave to him power to make doom
 for he is man's Son. ","Do not ye wonder in this
 for the hour cometh
 in which all men that be in burials
 shall hear the voice of God's Son. ","And they that have done good things
 shall go into again-rising of life; but they that have done evil things
 into again-rising of doom. [And they that have done good things
 shall come forth into rising again of life; forsooth they that have done evil things
 into rising again of doom.] ","I may nothing do of myself
 but as I hear
 I deem [I may not of myself do any thing
 but as I hear
 I judge]
 and my doom is just
 for I seek not my will
 but the will of the Father that sent me. ","If I bear witnessing of myself
 my witnessing is not true; ","another is that beareth witnessing of me
 and I know that his witnessing is true
 that he beareth of me. ","Ye sent to John
 and he bare witnessing to [the] truth. ","But I take not witnessing of man; but I say these things
 that ye be safe. ","He was a lantern burning and shining [He was a lantern burning and shining
 or giving light]; but ye would glad
 or joy
 at an hour in his light. ","But I have more witnessing than John
 for the works that my Father gave to me to perform them [forsooth the works that my Father gave me that I perform them]
 those works that I do bear witnessing of me
 that the Father sent me. ","And the Father that sent me
 he bare witnessing of me. Neither ye heard ever his voice
 neither ye saw his likeness [neither saw his likeness
 or form]. ","And ye have not his word dwelling in you; for ye believe not to him
 whom he sent. ","Seek ye the scriptures
 in which ye guess [in which ye ween] to have everlasting life; and those it be
 that bear witnessing of me. ","And ye will not come to me
 that ye have life. ","I take not clearness of men;","but I have known you
 that ye have not the love of God in you. ","I came in the name of my Father
 and ye took not me. If another [shall] come in his own name
 ye shall receive him. ","How be ye able to believe [How may ye believe]
 that receive glory each of (the) other
 and ye seek not the glory that is of God alone? ","Do not ye guess
 that I am to accuse you with the Father; it is Moses that accuseth you
 in whom ye hope. ","For if ye believed to Moses
 peradventure ye should believe also to me; for he wrote of me. ","But if ye believe not to his letters
 how shall ye believe to my words?","Therefore when Jesus had lifted up his eyes
 and had seen
 that a great multitude came to him
 he saith to Philip
 Whereof shall we buy loaves
 that these men eat? ","Therefore Jesus saith
 Make them sit to the meat [Make ye men to sit at the meat]. And there was much hay in the place. And so men sat to the meat
 as five thousand in number [Therefore men sat at the meat
 in number as five thousand]. ","And when they were filled
 he said to his disciples
 Gather ye the remnants that be left [Gather ye the reliefs that be left]
 that they perish not. ","And he said to them
 I am; do not ye dread. ","Jesus answered to them
 and said
 Truly
 truly
 I say to you
 ye seek me
 not for ye saw the miracles
 but for ye ate of the loaves
 and were filled. ","Work ye not (for) meat that perisheth
 but that that dwelleth into everlasting life
 which meat man's Son shall give to you; for God the Father hath marked him. ","Jesus answered
 and said to them
 This is the work of God
 that ye believe to him
 whom he sent. ","Therefore Jesus saith to them
 Truly
 truly
 I say to you
 Moses gave you not bread from heaven
 but my Father giveth you very bread from heaven; ","for it is very bread that cometh down from heaven
 and giveth life to the world. ","And Jesus said to them
 I am bread of life; he that cometh to me
 shall not hunger; and he that believeth in me
 shall never thirst. ","But I said to you
 that ye have seen me
 and ye believe not. [But I said to you
 for and ye have seen me
 and believed not.] ","All thing
 that the Father giveth to me
 shall come to me; and I shall not cast him out [and I shall not cast out him]
 that cometh to me. ","For I came down from heaven
 not that I do my will
 but the will of him that sent me. ","And this is the will of the Father that sent me
 that all thing that the Father gave to me
 I lose not of it [I lose nought of it]
 but again-raise it in the last day. ","And this is the will of my Father that sent me
 that each man that seeth the Son
 and believeth in him
 have everlasting life; and I shall again-raise him in the last day. ","Therefore Jesus answered
 and said to them
 Do not ye grumble together [Do not ye grutch together]. ","No man may come to me
 but if the Father that sent me
 draw him [no but the Father that sent me
 draw him]; and I shall again-raise him in the last day. ","It is written in the prophets
 And all men shall be able to be taught of God. Each man that hath heard of the Father
 and hath learned
 cometh to me.","Not for any man hath seen the Father
 but this that is of God
 hath seen the Father. ","Soothly
 soothly
 I say to you
 he that believeth in me
 hath everlasting life. ","I am [the] bread of life. [I am the bread of life.]","Your fathers ate manna in desert
 and be dead. ","This is bread coming down from heaven
 that if any man [shall] eat thereof
 he die not. ","I am living bread
 that came down from heaven. If any man eat of this bread
 he shall live without end. And the bread that I shall give
 is my flesh for the life of the world. ","Therefore Jesus saith to them
 Truly
 truly
 I say to you
 but ye eat the flesh of man's Son
 and drink his blood
 ye shall not have life in you. ","He that eateth my flesh
 and drinketh my blood
 hath everlasting life
 and I shall again-raise him in the last day. ","For my flesh is very meat
 and my blood is very drink. ","He that eateth my flesh
 and drinketh my blood
 dwelleth in me
 and I in him. ","As my Father living sent me
 and I live for the Father
 and he that eateth me
 he shall live for me. ","This is bread
 that came down from heaven. Not as your fathers ate manna
 and be dead; he that eateth this bread
 shall live without end. ","But Jesus witting at himself
 that his disciples grumbled of this thing [Forsooth Jesus witting with himself
 for his disciples grutched of this thing]
 said to them
 This thing offendeth you? ","Therefore if ye [shall] see man's Son ascending [up]
 where he was before? ","It is the spirit that quickeneth
 the flesh profiteth nothing; the words that I have spoken to you
 be spirit and life. ","But there be some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning
 which were believing
 and who was to betray him.","And he said
 Therefore I said to you
 that no man may come to me
 but it were given to him of my Father. ","Therefore Jesus said to the twelve
 Whether ye will also go away? ","Therefore Jesus answered to them
 Whether I chose not you twelve
 and one of you is a fiend [and one of you is a devil]? ","And his brethren said to him
 Pass from hence [Pass hence]
 and go into Judaea
 that also thy disciples see thy works that thou doest; ","Therefore Jesus saith to them
 My time came not yet
 but your time is evermore ready. ","The world may not hate you
 soothly it hateth me; for I bear witnessing thereof
 that the works of it be evil. ","Go ye up to this feast day
 but I shall not go up to this feast day
 for my time is not yet fulfilled [full-filled]. ","Jesus answered to them
 and said
 My doctrine is not mine
 but his that sent me. ","If any man will do his will
 he shall know of the teaching
 whether it be of God
 or [whether] I speak of myself. ","He that speaketh of himself
 seeketh his own glory; but he that seeketh the glory of him that sent him
 is soothfast
 and unrightwiseness is not in him. ","Whether Moses gave not to you a law
 and none of you doeth the law [and no man of you keepeth the law]? What seek ye to slay me? ","Jesus answered
 and said to them
 I have done one work
 and all ye wonder. ","Therefore Moses gave to you circumcision; not for it is of Moses
 but of the fathers; and in the sabbath ye circumcise a man. ","If a man take circumcision in the sabbath
 that the law of Moses be not broken
 have ye indignation to me
 for I made all a man whole in the sabbath [have ye indignation
 or wrath
 to me
 for I made all the man whole in the sabbath]? ","Do not ye deem after the face
 but deem ye a rightful doom [but deem a rightful doom].","Therefore some of Jerusalem said
 Whether this is not he
 whom the Jews seek to slay? ","Therefore Jesus cried in the temple teaching
 and said [Therefore Jesus cried in the temple
 teaching
 and saying]
 Ye know me
 and ye know of whence I am; and I came not of myself
 but he is true that sent me
 whom ye know not. ","I know him
 and if I say that I know him not
 I shall be like to you
 a liar; but I know him
 for of him I am
 and he sent me. ","Therefore Jesus said to them
 Yet a little time I am with you
 and I go to the Father
 that sent me. ","Ye shall seek me
 and ye shall not find me; and where I am
 ye be not able to come [and where I am
 ye may not come]. ","Therefore the Jews said to themselves
 Whither shall this go
 for we shall not find him? whether he will go into the scattering of heathen men
 and will teach the heathen? ","But in the last day of the great feast
 Jesus stood
 and cried
 and said [saying]
 If any man thirsteth
 come he to me
 and drink. ","He that believeth in me
 as the scripture saith
 Rivers of quick water shall flow out of his womb [Floods of quick water shall flow of his womb]. ","But he said this thing of the Spirit [Soothly he said this thing of the Holy Ghost]
 which men that believed in him should take; for the Spirit was not yet given
 for Jesus was not yet glorified. ","and said to him
 Master
 this woman is now taken in adultery. ","And when they abided asking him [Soothly when they lasted
 or continued
 asking him]
 he raised himself
 and said to them
 He of you that is without sin
 first cast a stone into her. ","And Jesus raised himself
 and said to her
 Woman
 where be they that accused thee? no man hath condemned thee. ","She said
 No man
 Lord. Jesus said to her
 Neither I shall condemn thee; go thou
 and now after do not thou sin no more[a]. ","Therefore again Jesus spake to them
 and said [saying]
 I am the light of the world; he that followeth me
 walketh not in darknesses
 but shall have the light of life. ","Jesus answered
 and said to them
 And if I bear witnessing of myself
 my witnessing is true; for I know from whence I came
 and whither I go. But ye know not from whence I came
 nor whither I go. ","For ye deem after the flesh
 but I deem no man; [Forsooth ye deem after the flesh
 I deem not any man;] ","and if I deem
 my doom is true
 for I am not alone
 but I and the Father that sent me. ","And in your law it is written
 that the witnessing of two men is true. ","I am
 that bear witnessing of myself
 and the Father that sent me
 beareth witnessing of me. ","Therefore they said to him
 Where is thy Father? Jesus answered
 Neither ye know me
 nor ye know my Father; if ye knew me
 peradventure ye should know also my Father. ","Therefore again Jesus said to them
 Lo! I go
 and ye shall seek me
 and ye shall die in your sin; whither I go
 ye be not able to come [whither I go
 ye may not come]. ","And he said to them
 Ye be of beneath
 I am of above; ye be of this world
 I am not of this world. ","Therefore I said to you
 that ye shall die in your sins; for if ye believe not that I am
 ye shall die in your sins. ","Therefore they said to him
 Who art thou? Jesus said to them
 The beginning
 which also speak to you [Jesus said to them
 The beginning
 or the first of all thing
 the which and I speak to you]. ","I have many things to speak
 and to deem of you
 but he that sent me is soothfast; and I speak in the world these things
 that I heard of him. ","Therefore Jesus said to them
 When ye have araised man's Son
 then ye shall know
 that I am
 and of myself I do nothing; but as my Father taught me
 I speak these things. ","And he that sent me is with me
 and left me not alone; for I do evermore those things
 that be pleasing to him. [And he that sent me is with me
 and left not me alone; for I do ever those things
 that be pleasant to him.] ","Therefore Jesus said to the Jews
 that believed in him
 If ye dwell in my word
 verily ye shall be my disciples; ","and ye shall know the truth
 and the truth shall make you free. ","Jesus answered to them
 Truly
 truly
 I say to you
 each man that doeth sin
 is [the] servant of sin. ","And the servant dwelleth not in the house without end [into without end]
 but the Son dwelleth without end [into without end]. ","Therefore if the Son [shall] make you free
 verily ye shall be free. ","I know that ye be Abraham's sons
 but ye seek to slay me
 for my word taketh not in you. ","I speak those things
 that I saw at my Father; and ye do those things
 that ye saw at your father. ","They answered
 and said to him
 Abraham is our father. Jesus saith to them
 If ye be the sons of Abraham
 do ye the works of Abraham. ","But now ye seek to slay me
 a man that have spoken to you [the] truth
 that I heard of God; Abraham did not this thing. ","Ye do the works of your father. Therefore they said to him [And so they said to him]
 We be not born of fornication; we have one Father
 God. ","But Jesus saith to them
 If God were your Father
 soothly ye should love me; for I passed forth of God
 and came [forsooth I proceeded
 or went forth
 of God
 and came]; for neither I came of myself
 but he sent me. ","Why know ye not my speech? for ye be not able to hear my word.","Ye be of the father
 the devil
 and ye will do the desires of your father. He was a manslayer from the beginning
 and he stood not in truth; for truth is not in him. When he speaketh lying [When he speaketh a lying]
 he speaketh of his own; for he is a liar
 and father of it. ","But for I say truth
 ye believe not to me. ","Who of you shall reprove me of sin? if I say truth
 why believe ye not to me? ","He that is of God
 heareth the words of God; therefore ye hear not
 for ye be not of God. ","Jesus answered
 and said
 I have not a devil
 but I honour my Father
 and ye have unhonoured me. ","For I seek not my glory; there is he
 that seeketh
 and deemeth. ","Truly
 truly
 I say to you
 if any man keep my word
 he shall not taste death without end. [Truly
 truly
 I say to you
 if any man shall keep my word
 he shall not see
 or taste
 death into without end.] ","Therefore the Jews said
 Now we have known
 that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead
 and the prophets
 and thou sayest
 If any man keep my word
 he shall not taste death without end [he shall not taste death into without end]. ","Jesus answered
 If I glorify myself
 my glory is nought; my Father is
 that glorifieth me
 whom ye say
 that he is your God. ","And ye have not known him
 but I have known him; and if I [shall] say that I know him not
 I shall be a liar like to you; but I know him
 and I keep his word. ","Abraham
 your father
 gladded to see my day [Abraham
 your father
 gladded
 or full out joyed
 that he should see my day]; and he saw
 and joyed. ","Therefore Jesus said to them
 Truly
 truly I say to you
 before that Abraham should be
 I am. [Therefore Jesus said to them
 Truly
 truly
 I say to you
 before that Abraham was made
 I am.] ","Jesus answered
 Neither this man sinned
 neither his elders [neither his father and mother]; but that the works of God be showed in him. ","It behooveth me to work the works of him that sent me
 as long as the day is [the while the day is]; the night shall come
 when no man may work. ","As long as I am in the world
 I am the light of the world. ","and said to him
 Go
 and be thou washed in the water of Siloam
 that is to say
 Sent. Then he went
 and washed
 and came seeing. [and said to him
 Go
 and be thou washen in the water
 or cistern
 of Siloam
 that is interpreted
 Sent. Therefore he went
 and washed
 and came seeing.] ","He answered
 That man
 that is said Jesus
 made clay
 and anointed mine eyes

 Go thou to the water of Siloam
 and wash [Go thou to the water
 or cistern
 of Siloam
 and wash]; and I went
 and washed
 and saw. ","And they said to him
 Where is he? He said
 I know not. ","Therefore again they called the man
 that was blind
 and said to him
 Give thou glory to God; we know
 that this man is a sinner. ","Then he said
 If he is a sinner
 I know not; one thing I know
 that when I was blind
 now I see. ","Therefore they said to him
 What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes? ","He answered to them
 I said to you now
 and ye heard; what will ye again hear? whether [and] ye will be made his disciples? ","Jesus heard
 that they had put him out [Jesus heard
 for they had cast him out]; and when he had found him
 he said to him
 Believest thou in the Son of God? ","And Jesus said to him
 And thou hast seen him
 and he it is
 that speaketh with thee. ","Therefore Jesus said to him
 I came into this world
 into doom
 that they that see not
 see
 and they that see
 be made blind. ","Jesus said to them
 If ye were blind
 ye should not have sin; but now ye say
 That we see
 your sin dwelleth still [your sin dwelleth].","Truly
 truly
 I say to you
 he that cometh not in by the door into the fold of sheep
 but ascendeth [up] by another way
 is a night thief and a day thief. ","But he that entereth by the door
 is the shepherd of the sheep. ","To this the porter openeth
 and the sheep hear his voice
 and he calleth his own sheep by name
 and leadeth them out. ","And when he hath done out his own sheep [And when he hath sent out his own sheep]
 he goeth before them
 and the sheep follow him; for they know his voice. ","But they follow not an alien
 but flee from him; for they have not known the voice of aliens. ","Therefore Jesus said to them again
 Truly
 truly
 I say to you
 I am the door of the sheep. ","As many as have come
 were night thieves and day thieves
 but the sheep heard not them. [All how many ever came before me
 be night thieves and day thieves
 but the sheep heard not them.] ","I am the door. If any man shall enter by me
 he shall be saved; and he shall go in
 and shall go out
 and he shall find pastures. ","A night thief cometh not
 but that he steal
 slay
 and destroy; and I came
 that they have life
 and have more plenteously. [A night thief cometh not
 but that he steal
 and slay
 and lose; I came
 that they have life
 and have more plenteously.] ","I am a good shepherd; a good shepherd giveth his life for his sheep.","But an hired hind

 and scattereth the sheep. ","And the hired hind fleeth
 for he is an hired hind
 and it pertaineth not to him of the sheep. ","I am a good shepherd

 I know the Father; and I put my life for my sheep. ","[And] I have other sheep
 that be not of this fold

 and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be made one fold and one shepherd. ","Therefore the Father loveth me
 for I put my life
 that again I take it. ","No man taketh it from me
 but I put it of myself. I have power to put it
 and I have power to take it again. This commandment I have taken of my Father. ","Jesus answered to them
 I speak to you
 and ye believe not; the works that I do in the name of my Father
 bear witnessing of me [the works that I do in the name of my Father
 these bear witness of me]. ","But ye believe not
 for ye be not of my sheep. ","My sheep hear my voice
 and I know them

 is more than all things [That thing that my Father gave to me
 is more than all]; and no man may snatch from my Father's hand. ","I and the Father be one.","Jesus answered to them
 I have showed to you many good works of my Father
 for which work of them stone ye me? ","Jesus answered to them
 Whether it is not written in your law
 That I said
 Ye be gods? ","If he said that they were gods
 to whom the word of God was made
 and the scripture may not be undone
 ","that that the Father hath hallowed
 and hath sent into the world [which the Father hallowed
 and sent into the world]

 I am God's Son? ","If I do not the works of my Father
 do not ye believe to me; ","but if I do
 though ye will not believe to me
 believe ye to the works; that ye know and believe
 that the Father is in me
 and I in the Father. ","And Jesus heard
 and said to them
 This sickness is not to the death
 but for the glory of God
 that man's Son be glorified by him [that God's Son be glorified by it]. ","And after these things he said to his disciples
 Go we again into Judaea. ","Jesus answered
 Whether there be not twelve hours of the day? If any man wander in the day

 for he seeth the light of this world.] ","But if he wander in the night
 he stumbleth
 for light is not in him. ","He said these things [These things he saith]

 Lazarus is dead; ","and I have joy for you
 that ye believe

 though he be dead
 he shall live; ","and each that liveth
 and believeth in me
 shall not die without end[a]. Believest thou this thing? ","She saith to him
 Yea
 Lord
 I have believed
 that thou art Christ
 the Son of the living God
 that hast come into this world. ","But when Mary was come where Jesus was
 she seeing him felled down to his feet [seeing him fell down to this feet]
 and said to him
 Lord
 if thou haddest been here
 my brother had not be dead. ","and said
 Where have ye laid him? They said to him
 Lord
 come
 and see. ","And Jesus saith
 Take ye away the stone. Martha
 the sister of him that was dead
 saith to him
 Lord
 he stinketh now
 for he hath lain four days.[b] ","Jesus saith to her
 Have I not said to thee
 that if thou believest [for if thou shalt believe]
 thou shalt see the glory of God? ","Therefore they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes
 and said
 Father
 I do thankings to thee
 for thou hast heard me; ","and I knew
 that thou evermore hearest me [forsooth
 I knew
 for thou ever hearest me]
 but for the people that standeth about
 I said
 that they believe
 that thou hast sent me. ","When he had said these things
 he cried with a great voice
 Lazarus
 come forth. ","And at once he that was dead
 came out
 bound the hands and feet with bonds
 and his face bound with a sudarium. And Jesus saith to them
 Unbind ye him
 and suffer ye him to go forth. [And anon
 he that was dead
 came forth
 bound the hands and feet with bonds
 and his face was bound with a sudarium
 or sweating cloth. Jesus saith to them
 Unbind ye him
 and suffer ye him for to go away.] ","Therefore Jesus said
 Suffer ye her
 that into the day of my burying she keep that; ","for ye shall evermore have poor men with you
 but ye shall not evermore have me.[a] ","Therefore the people bare witnessing
 that was with him
 when he called Lazarus from the grave
 and raised him from death [from dead]. ","Therefore the Pharisees said to themselves
 Ye see
 that we profit nothing; lo! all the world hath gone after him [lo! all the world went after him]. ","And these came to Philip
 that was of Bethsaida of Galilee
 and prayed him
 and said
 Sire
 we will see Jesus [and prayed him
 saying
 Sire
 we would see Jesus]. ","And Jesus answered to them
 and said [saying]
 The hour cometh
 that man's Son be clarified. ","Truly
 truly
 I say to you
 but a corn of wheat fall into the earth
 and be dead
 it dwelleth alone; but if it be dead
 it bringeth [forth] much fruit. ","He that loveth his life
 shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world
 keepeth it into everlasting life. ","If any man serve me
 follow he me; and where I am
 there my minister shall be [there and my minister
 or servant
 shall be]. If any man serve me
 my Father shall honour him [my Father shall worship him]. ","Now my soul is troubled
 and what shall I say? Father
 save me from this hour; but therefore [but for that thing] I came into this hour; ","Father
 clarify thy name. And a voice came from heaven
 and said [saying]
 And I have clarified
 and again I shall clarify. ","Jesus answered
 and said
 This voice came not for me
 but for you. ","Now is the doom of the world
 now the prince of this world shall be cast out. ","And if I shall be enhanced from the earth
 I shall draw all things to myself. ","And then Jesus saith to them
 Yet a little light is in you; walk ye
 the while ye have light
 that darkness catch you not [that darknesses catch not you]; he that wandereth in darknesses
 knoweth not whither he goeth. ","While ye have light
 believe ye in the light
 that ye be the children of light. Jesus spake these things
 and went
 and hid him(self) from them.","And Jesus cried
 and said
 He that believeth in me
 believeth not in me
 but in him that sent me. ","He that seeth me
 seeth him that sent me. ","I light came into the world
 that each that believeth in me
 dwell not in darknesses. ","And if any man heareth my words
 and keepeth them not
 I deem him not [And if any man shall hear my words
 and shall not keep
 I deem not him]; for I came not
 that I deem the world
 but that I make the world safe.","He that despiseth me
 and taketh not my words
 hath him that shall judge him; that word that I have spoken
 [that] shall deem him in the last day [the word that I have spoken
 that shall deem him in the last day]. ","For I have not spoken of myself
 but that Father that sent me
 [he] gave to me a commandment
 what I shall say
 and what I shall speak. ","And I know
 that his commandment is everlasting life; therefore those things that I speak
 as the Father said to me
 so I speak.","Jesus answered
 and said to him
 What I do
 thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know afterward. ","Peter saith to him
 Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered to him
 If I shall not wash thee
 thou shalt not have part with me. ","Jesus saith to him
 He that is washed
 hath no need but that he wash the feet
 but he is all clean [but he is clean all]; and ye be clean
 but not all. ","For he knew
 who it was that should betray him [Forsooth he knew
 who should betray him]; therefore he said
 Ye be not all clean. ","And so after that he had washed their feet
 he took his clothes; and when he was set to meat again
 again he said to them
 Ye know what I have done to you. [Therefore after that he had washed the feet of them
 he took his clothes; and when he had rested again
 again he said to them
 Know ye what I have done to you(?)] ","Ye call me master and Lord
 and ye say well; for I am. ","Therefore if I
 Lord and master
 have washed your feet
 and ye shall wash one another's feet [and ye owe to wash another the tother's feet];","for I have given to you ensample
 that as I have done to you
 so do ye. [for I have given example to you
 that as I have done to you
 so and ye do.] ","Truly
 truly
 I say to you
 the servant is not greater than his lord
 neither an apostle is greater than he that sent him. ","If ye know these things
 ye shall be blessed
 if ye do them. ","I say not of you all
 I know which I have chosen [I know whom I have chosen]; but that the scripture be fulfilled
 He that eateth my bread
 shall raise his heel against me. ","Truly
 I say to you before it be done
 that when it is done
 ye believe that I am. ","Truly
 truly
 I say to you
 he that taketh whomever I shall send
 receiveth me; and he that receiveth me
 receiveth him that sent me. ","When Jesus had said these things
 he was troubled in spirit
 and witnessed
 and said
 Truly
 truly
 I say to you
 that one of you shall betray me. ","Jesus answered
 He it is
 to whom I shall areach a sop of bread. And when he had wet bread
 he gave to Judas of Simon Iscariot. [Jesus answered
 He it is
 to whom I shall dress bread dipped in. And when he had dipped in bread
 he gave to Judas of Simon Iscariot.]","And after the morsel
 then Satan entered into him. And Jesus saith to him
 That thing that thou doest
 do thou swiftly.","Therefore when he was gone out
 Jesus said
 Now man's Son is clarified
 and God is clarified in him. ","If God is clarified in him
 and God shall clarify him in himself
 and at once [and anon] he shall clarify him. ","Little sons
 yet a little I am with you; ye shall seek me
 and
 as I said to the Jews
 Whither I go
 ye be not able to come [Whither I go
 ye may not come]; and to you I say now. ","I give to you a new commandment
 that ye love together
 as I have loved you
 and that ye love together [that ye love together
 as I loved you
 that and ye love together]. ","In this thing all men shall know
 that ye be my disciples
 if ye have love together. ","Simon Peter saith to him
 Lord
 whither goest thou? Jesus answered
 Whither I go
 thou mayest not follow me now
 but thou shalt follow me afterward. ","Jesus answered
 Thou shalt put thy life for me? Truly
 truly
 I say to thee
 the cock shall not crow
 till thou shalt deny me thrice. ","Be not your heart afraid [Be not your heart distroubled]
 nor dread it; ye believe in God
 and believe ye in me. ","In the house of my Father be many dwellings; if any thing less
 I had said to you [if any thing less
 I should have said to you]
 for I go to make ready to you a place. ","And if I go
 and make ready to you a place
 again I come
 and I shall take you to myself
 that where I am
 ye be. ","And whither I go
 ye know
 and ye know the way. ","Jesus saith to him
 I am way
 truth
 and life; no man cometh to the Father
 but by me. ","If ye had known me
 soothly ye had known also my Father; and afterward ye shall know him
 and ye have seen him. ","Jesus saith to him
 So long time I am with you
 and have ye not known me? Philip
 he that seeth me
 seeth also the Father. How sayest thou
 show to us the Father? ","Believest thou not
 that I am in the Father
 and the Father is in me? The words that I speak to you
 I speak not of myself; but the Father himself that dwelleth in me
 [he] doeth the works. ","Believe ye not
 that I am in the Father
 and the Father is in me? Else believe ye for those works. ","Truly
 truly
 I say to you
 if a man believeth in me [Truly
 truly
 I say to you
 he that believeth in me]
 also he shall do the works that I do; and he shall do greater works than these
 for I go to the Father. ","And whatever thing ye [shall] ask the Father in my name
 I shall do this thing
 that the Father be glorified in the Son. ","If ye [shall] ask any thing in my name
 I shall do it. ","If ye love me
 keep ye my commandments. ","And I shall pray the Father
 and he shall give to you another comforter
 the Spirit of truth
 to dwell with you without end; [And I shall pray the Father
 and he shall give to you another comforter
 that he dwell with you into without end;] ","which Spirit the world may not take [the Spirit of truth
 which Spirit the world may not take]
 for it seeth him not
 neither knoweth him. But ye shall know him
 for he shall dwell with you
 and he shall be in you. ","I shall not leave you fatherless
 I shall come to you. ","Yet a little
 and the world seeth not now me [Yet a little
 and the world seeth not me now]; but ye shall see me
 for I live
 and ye shall live. ","In that day ye shall know
 that I am in my Father
 and ye in me
 and I in you. ","He that hath my commandments
 and keepeth them
 he it is that loveth me; and he that loveth me
 shall be loved of my Father
 and I shall love him
 and I shall show to him myself. ","Judas saith to him
 not he of Iscariot
 Lord
 what is done
 that thou shalt show thyself to us
 and not to the world? ","Jesus answered
 and said to him
 If any man loveth me
 he shall keep my word [he shall keep my words]; and my Father shall love him
 and we shall come to him
 and we shall dwell with him [and we shall make a dwelling at him]. ","He that loveth me not
 keepeth not my words; and the word which ye have heard
 is not mine
 but the Father's
 that sent me. ","These things I have spoken to you
 dwelling among you; ","but that Holy Ghost
 the comforter
 whom the Father shall send in my name
 he shall teach you all things
 and shall show to you all things
 whatever things I shall say to you [he shall teach you all things
 and shall show
 or remember
 to you all things
 whatever I shall say to you]. ","Peace I leave to you
 my peace I give to you; not as the world giveth
 I give to you; be not your heart afraid
 nor dread it [be not your heart troubled
 neither dread it]. ","Ye have heard
 that I said to you
 I go
 and come to you. If ye loved me
 forsooth ye should have joy [If ye loved me
 forsooth ye should joy]
 for I go to the Father
 for the Father is greater than I. ","And now I have said to you
 before that it be done [before it be done]
 that when it is done
 ye believe. ","Now I shall not speak many things with you; for the prince of this world cometh
 and hath not in me any thing [and he hath not any thing in me]. ","But that the world know
 that I love the Father; and as the Father gave a commandment to me
 so I do. Rise ye
 go we hence.","I am a very vine
 and my Father is an earth-tiller. ","Each branch in me that beareth not fruit
 he shall take away it [he shall do it away]; and each that beareth fruit
 he shall purge it
 that it bear the more fruit [that it bear more fruit]. ","Now ye be clean
 for the word that I have spoken to you. ","Dwell ye in me
 and I in you; as a branch may not make fruit of itself
 but it dwell in the vine
 so neither ye
 but ye dwell in me. ","I am the vine
 ye be the branches. Who that dwelleth in me
 and I in him
 this beareth much fruit
 for without me
 ye be able to nothing do.[a] ","If any man dwelleth not in me
 he shall be cast out as a branch
 and shall wax dry; and they shall gather him
 and they shall cast him into the fire
 and he shall burn [and he burneth]. ","If ye dwell in me
 and my words dwell in you
 whatever thing ye will [whatever thing ye shall desire]
 ye shall ask
 and it shall be done to you. ","In this thing my Father is clarified
 that ye bring forth full much fruit
 and that ye be made my disciples. ","As my Father loved me
 I have loved you; dwell ye in my love. ","If ye keep my commandments
 ye shall dwell in my love; as I have kept the commandments of my Father
 and dwell in his love. ","These things I spake to you
 that my joy be in you
 and your joy be full-filled [and your joy be filled]. ","This is my commandment
 that ye love together
 as I have loved you. ","No man hath more love than this
 that a man put his life for his friends. ","Ye be my friends if ye do those things
 that I command to you. ","Now I shall not call you servants
 for the servant knoweth not
 what his lord shall do; but I have called you friends
 for all things whatever I heard of my Father
 I have made known to you. ","Ye have not chosen me
 but I chose you; and I have put you [and put you]
 that ye go
 and bring forth fruit
 and your fruit dwell; that whatever thing ye [shall] ask the Father in my name
 he give to you. ","These things I command to you
 that ye love together. ","If the world hate you
 know ye
 that it had me in hate rather than you [know ye
 for it had me in hate first than you]. ","If ye had been of the world
 the world should love that thing that was his; but for ye be not of the world
 but I chose you from the world
 therefore the world hateth you. ","Have ye mind of my word
 which I said to you [that I said to you]
 The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have pursued me
 they shall pursue you also; if they have kept my word
 they shall keep yours also. ","But they shall do to you all these things for my name
 for they know not him that sent me. ","If I had not come
 and had not spoken to them
 they should not have sin; but now they have none excusation of their sin [forsooth now they have not excusing of their sin]. ","He that hateth me
 hateth also my Father. ","If I had not done the works in them
 which none other man did
 they should not have sin; but now both they have seen
 and hated\/have hated me and my Father. ","But that the word be fulfilled
 that is written in their law
 For they had me in hate without cause. ","But when the comforter shall come
 which I shall send to you from the Father
 the Spirit of truth
 which cometh forth of the Father [which proceedeth
 or cometh forth
 of the Father]
 he shall bear witnessing of me; ","and ye shall bear witnessing
 for ye be with me from the beginning.","These things I have spoken to you
 that ye be not caused to stumble [that ye be not offended]. ","They shall make you without the synagogues
 but the hour cometh
 that each man that slayeth you
 deem that he doeth service to God. ","And they shall do to you these things
 for they have not known the Father
 neither me. ","But these things I spake to you
 that when the hour of them shall come
 ye have mind
 that I said to you. I said not to you these things from the beginning
 for I was with you. ","And now I go to him that sent me
 and no man of you asketh me
 Whither goest thou? ","but for I have spoken to you these things
 heaviness hath full-filled your heart [sorrow
 or heaviness
 hath full-filled your heart]. ","But I say to you truth
 it speedeth to you
 that I go; for if I go not forth [soothly if I shall not go away]
 the comforter shall not come to you; but if I go forth [forsooth if I shall go away]
 I shall send him to you. ","And when he cometh [And when he shall come]
 he shall reprove the world of sin
 and of rightwiseness
 and of doom. ","Of sin
 for they have not believed in me; ","and of rightwiseness
 for I go to the Father
 and now ye shall not see me; ","but of doom
 for the prince of this world is now deemed. ","Yet I have many things to say to you
 but ye be not able to bear them now. ","But when the Spirit of truth cometh [shall come]
 he shall teach you all truth; for he shall not speak of himself
 but whatever things he shall hear
 he shall speak; and he shall tell to you those things [and he shall tell to you the things] that be to come. ","He shall clarify me
 for of mine he shall take
 and shall tell to you. ","All things
 whatever [things] the Father hath
 be mine; therefore I said to you
 that of mine he shall take
 and shall tell to you. ","A little
 and then ye shall not see me; and again a little
 and ye shall see me
 for I go to the Father. ","Therefore some of his disciples said together
 What is this thing that he saith to us
 A little
 and ye shall not see me; and again a little
 and ye shall see me
 for I go to the Father? ","Therefore they said
 What is this that he saith to us
 A little? we know not what he speaketh. ","And Jesus knew
 that they would ask him
 and he said to them
 Of this thing ye seek among you
 for I said
 A little
 and ye shall not see me; and again a little
 and ye shall see me. ","Truly
 truly
 I say to you
 that ye shall mourn and weep
 but the world shall have joy; and ye shall be sorrowful
 but your sorrow shall turn into joy. ","A woman when she beareth child
 hath heaviness [hath sorrow
 or heaviness]
 for her time is come; but when she hath born a son
 now she thinketh not on the pain
 for joy
 for a man is born into the world. ","And therefore ye have now sorrow
 but again I shall see you
 and your heart shall have joy
 and no man shall take from you your joy. ","And in that day ye shall not ask me any thing; truly
 truly
 I say to you
 if ye ask the Father any thing in my name
 he shall give [it] to you. ","Till now ye asked nothing in my name; ask ye
 and ye shall take
 that your joy be full. ","I have spoken to you these things in proverbs; the hour cometh
 when now I shall not speak to you in proverbs
 but openly of my Father I shall tell to you [I shall tell you]. ","In that day ye shall ask in my name; and I say not to you
 that I shall pray the Father for you; ","for the Father himself loveth you
 for ye have loved me
 and have believed
 that I went out from God. ","I went out from the Father
 and I came into the world; again I leave the world
 and go to the Father. ","Jesus answered to them
 Now ye believe. ","Lo! the hour cometh
 and now it cometh
 that ye be scattered
 each into his own things
 and that ye leave me alone; and I am not alone
 for the Father is with me. ","These things I have spoken to you
 that ye have peace in me; in the world ye shall have dis-ease [in the world ye shall have pressing
 or overlaying]
 but trust ye
 I have overcome the world.","These things Jesus spake
 and when he had cast up his eyes into heaven [and the eyes lifted up to heaven]
 he said
 Father
 the hour cometh
 clarify thy Son
 that thy Son clarify thee. ","As thou hast given to him power on each flesh
 that all thing that thou hast given to him
 he give to them everlasting life. ","And this is everlasting life
 that they know thee very God alone [that they know thee alone very God]
 and whom thou hast sent
 Jesus Christ. ","I have clarified thee on the earth
 I have ended the work
 that thou hast given to me to do. ","And now
 Father
 clarify thou me at thyself
 with the clearness that I had at thee
 before the world was made. ","I have showed thy name to those men
 which thou hast given to me of the world [I have showed thy name to the men
 whom thou hast given to me of the world]; they were thine
 and thou hast given them to me
 and they have kept thy word. ","And now they have known
 that all things that thou hast given to me
 be of thee. ","For the words that thou hast given to me
 I gave to them; and they have taken
 and have known verily
 that I went out from thee; and they believed
 that thou sentest me. ","I pray for them
 I pray not for the world
 but for them that thou hast given to me
 for they be thine. ","And all my things be thine
 and thy things be mine [And all mine things be thine
 and thine things be mine]; and I am clarified in them. ","And now I am not in the world
 and these be in the world
 and I come to thee. Holy Father
 keep them in thy name
 which thou hast given to me [whom thou hast given to me]
 that they be one
 as we be. ","While I was with them
 I kept them in thy name; those that thou gavest to me
 I kept
 and none of them perished
 but the son of perdition
 that the scripture be fulfilled. ","But now I come to thee
 and I speak these things in the world [and these things I speak in the world]
 that they have my joy fulfilled in themselves. ","I gave to them thy word
 and the world had them in hate; for they be not of the world
 as I am not of the world. ","I pray not
 that thou take them away from the world
 but that thou keep them from evil. ","They be not of the world
 as I am not of the world. ","Hallow thou them in truth; thy word is truth.","As thou sentest me into the world
 also I sent them into the world. ","And I hallow myself for them
 that also they be hallowed in truth. ","And I pray not only for them
 but also for them that shall believe into me by the word of them; ","that all be one [that all they be one]
 as thou
 Father
 in me
 and I in thee
 that also they in us be one; that the world believe
 that thou hast sent me. ","And I have given to them the clearness
 that thou hast given to me
 that they be one
 as we be one; ","I in them
 and thou in me
 that they be ended into one; and that the world know
 that thou sentest me
 and hast loved them
 as thou hast loved also me. ","Father
 they which thou hast given to me
 I will that where I am
 that they be with me
 that they see my clearness
 that thou hast given to me [Father
 I will that and they whom thou hast given to me
 be with me where I am
 that they see my clearness
 which thou hast given to me]; for thou lovedest me before the making of the world. ","Father
 rightfully the world knew thee not [Rightful Father
 the world knew not thee]
 but I knew thee
 and these knew
 that thou sentest me. ","And I have made thy name known to them
 and shall make known; that the love by which thou hast loved me
 be in them
 and I in them.","And so Jesus witting all things that were to come on him
 went forth
 and said to them
 Whom seek ye? ","They answered to him
 Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith to them
 I am. And Judas that betrayed him
 stood with them. ","And when he said to them
 I am
 they went aback
 and fell down on the earth. ","And again he asked them
 Whom seek ye? And they said
 Jesus of Nazareth. ","He answered to them
 I said to you
 that I am; therefore if ye seek me
 suffer ye these to go away. ","Therefore Jesus said to Peter
 Put thou thy sword into thy sheath [Send thou the sword into the sheath]; wilt thou not
 that I drink the cup
 that my Father gave to me? ","And the damsel
 keeper of the door
 said to Peter
 Whether thou art also of this man's disciples? He said
 I am not. ","Jesus answered to him
 I have spoken openly to the world; I taught evermore in the synagogue
 and in the temple
 whither all the Jews came together
 and in huddles I spake nothing[a]. ","What askest thou me? ask them that heard me
 what I have spoken to them; lo! they know
 what things I have said. ","Jesus answered to him
 If I have spoken evil
 bear thou witnessing of evil; but if I said well
 why smitest thou me? ","Then Pilate saith to them
 Take ye him
 and deem ye him
 after your law. And the Jews said to him [Therefore they said to him]
 It is not leaveful to us to slay any man; ","Jesus answered
 and said to him
 Sayest thou this thing of thyself
 or others have said to thee of me [Sayest thou this thing of thyself
 or others said to thee of me]? ","Jesus answered
 My kingdom is not of this world; if my kingdom were of this world
 my ministers would strive
 that I should not be taken to the Jews; but now my kingdom is not here [now forsooth my kingdom is not of hence]. ","And so Pilate said to him
 Then art thou a king? Jesus answered
 Thou sayest
 that I am a king. To this thing I am born
 and to this I came into the world
 to bear witnessing to truth [and to this I came into the world
 that I bear witnessing to truth]. Each [man] that is of truth
 heareth my voice. ","Again Pilate went out
 and said to them
 Lo! I bring him out to you [Lo! I lead him to you withoutforth]
 that ye know
 that I find no cause in him. ","And so Jesus went out
 bearing a crown of thorns
 and a cloak of purple [and a cloth of purple]. And he saith to them
 Lo! the man. ","But when the bishops and ministers had seen him
 they cried
 and said [saying]
 Crucify
 crucify him. Pilate saith to them
 Take ye him
 and crucify ye [him]
 for I find no cause in him. ","Jesus answered
 Thou shouldest not have any power against me
 but it were given to thee from above; therefore he that betook me to thee
 hath the more sin. ","And it was pask eve [Forsooth it was the making ready
 or even
 of pask]
 as it were the sixth hour. And he saith to the Jews
 Lo! your king. ","Therefore when Jesus had seen his mother
 and the disciple standing
 whom he loved
 he saith to his mother
 Woman
 lo! thy son. ","Afterward he saith to the disciple
 Lo! thy mother. And from that hour the disciple took her into his mother [And from that hour the disciple took her into his things]. ","Afterward Jesus witting
 that now all things be ended
 that the scripture were fulfilled [that the scripture should be fulfilled]
 he saith
 I thirst. ","Therefore when Jesus had taken the vinegar
 he said
 It is ended. And when his head was bowed down
 he gave up the ghost\/And he bowed down the head
 and sent out the spirit. ","Therefore she ran
 and came to Simon Peter
 and to another disciple
 whom Jesus loved
 and saith to them
 They have taken the Lord from the grave
 and we know not
 where they have laid him. ","And they say to her
 Woman
 what weepest thou? She said to them
 For they have taken away my Lord
 and I know not
 where they have laid him. ","Jesus saith to her
 Woman
 what weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She guessing that he was the gardener
 saith to him
 Sire
 if thou hast taken him up
 say to me
 where thou hast laid him
 and I shall take him away. ","Jesus saith to her
 Mary. She turned
 and saith to him
 Rabboni
 that is to say
 Master. ","Jesus saith to her
 Do not thou touch me
 for I have not yet ascended to my Father; but go to my brethren
 and say to them
 I ascend to my Father and to your Father
 to my God and to your God [and say to them
 I ascend to my Father and your Father
 to my God and your God]. ","Therefore when it was even in that day [Therefore when eventide was in that day]
 [in] one of the sabbaths
 and the gates were shut
 where the disciples were gathered
 for dread of the Jews
 Jesus came
 and stood in the middle of the disciples
 and he saith to them
 Peace to you [and said to them
 Peace be to you]. ","And he saith to them again
 Peace to you; as the Father sent me
 I send you. [Therefore he said to them again
 Peace to you; as the Father hath sent me
 and I send you.]","When he had said this
 he blew on them
 and said
 Take ye the Holy Ghost; ","whose sins ye forgive
 those be forgiven to them [they be forgiven]; and whose sins ye withhold
 those be withheld [they be withholden].","Therefore the other disciples said
 We have seen the Lord. And he said to them
 But I see in his hands the printing of the nails
 and put my finger into the place of the nails
 and put mine hand into his side
 I shall not believe. [Forsooth he said to them
 No but I shall see in his hands the fixing of nails
 and shall send my finger into the places of the nails
 and shall send mine hand into his side
 I shall not believe.]","And after eight days again his disciples were within
 and Thomas with them. Jesus came
 while the gates were shut [Jesus came
 the gates shut]
 and stood in the middle
 and said
 Peace to you. ","Afterward he saith to Thomas
 Put in here thy finger
 and see mine hands
 and put hither thine hand
 and put [it] into my side [Bring in hither thy finger
 and see mine hands
 and bring to thine hand
 and send
 or put
 it into my side]
 and do not thou be unbelieveful
 but faithful. ","Jesus saith to him
 Thomas
 for thou hast seen me
 thou believedest; blessed be they
 that saw not
 and have believed. ","Therefore Jesus saith to them
 Children
 whether ye have any supping thing? They answered to him
 Nay. ","Jesus saith to them
 Bring ye of the fishes
 which ye have taken now. ","Jesus saith to them
 Come ye
 and eat ye. And no man of them that sat at the meat
 durst ask him
 Who art thou
 witting that it is the Lord. ","And when they had eaten
 Jesus saith to Simon Peter
 Simon of Jonas
 lovest thou me more than these? He saith to him
 Yea
 Lord
 thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith to him
 Feed thou my lambs [Feed my lambs]. ","Again he saith to him
 Simon of Jonas
 lovest thou me? He saith to him
 Yea
 Lord
 thou knowest that I love thee. He saith to him
 Feed thou my lambs. ","He saith to him the third time
 Simon of Jonas
 lovest thou me? Peter was heavy [sorry]
 for he said to him the third time
 Lovest thou me
 and he saith to him
 Lord
 thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith to him
 Feed my sheep. ","Truly
 truly
 I say to thee
 when thou were younger
 thou girdedest thee
 and wanderedest where thou wouldest; but when thou shalt wax older
 thou shalt hold forth thine hands
 and another shall gird thee
 and shall lead thee whither thou wilt not [and lead thee whither thou wilt not]. ","He said this thing
 signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had said these things
 he saith to him
 Follow thou me. ","Jesus saith to him
 So I will that he dwell till I come
 what to thee? follow thou me. ","Therefore this word went out among the brethren
 that that disciple dieth not. And Jesus said not to him
 that he dieth not
 but
 So I will that he dwell till I come
 what to thee? "
