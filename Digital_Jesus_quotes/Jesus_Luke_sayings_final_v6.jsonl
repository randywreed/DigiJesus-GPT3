"And he said unto them
 How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be about my Father\u2019s business? ","And Jesus answered him
 saying
 It is written
 That man shall not live by bread alone
 but by every word of God.","And the devil said unto him
 All this power will I give thee
 and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it. ","And Jesus answered and said unto him
 Get thee behind me
 Satan: for it is written
 Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God
 and him only shalt thou serve.","And he brought him to Jerusalem
 and set him on a pinnacle of the temple
 and said unto him
 If thou be the Son of God
 cast thyself down from hence: ","And Jesus answering said unto him
 It is said
 Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. ","The Spirit of the Lord is upon me
 because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted
 to preach deliverance to the captives
 and recovering of sight to the blind
 to set at liberty them that are bruised
 ","to preach the acceptable year of the Lord.","And he began to say unto them
 This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears. ","And he said unto them
 Ye will surely say unto me this proverb
 Physician
 heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum
 do also here in thy country. ","And he said
 Verily I say unto you
 No prophet is accepted in his own country. ","But I tell you of a truth
 many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias
 when the heaven was shut up three years and six months
 when great famine was throughout all the land; ","but unto none of them was Elias sent
 save unto Sarepta
 a city of Sidon
 unto a woman that was a widow. ","And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet; and none of them was cleansed
 saving Naaman the Syrian.","And they were astonished at his doctrine: for his word was with power.","And Jesus rebuked him
 saying
 Hold thy peace
 and come out of him. And when the devil had thrown him in the midst
 he came out of him
 and hurt him not. ","And devils also came out of many
 crying out
 and saying
 Thou art Christ the Son of God. And he rebuking them suffered them not to speak: for they knew that he was Christ.","And he said unto them
 I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also: for therefore am I sent. ","Now when he had left speaking
 he said unto Simon
 Launch out into the deep
 and let down your nets for a draught. ","and so was also James
 and John
 the sons of Zebedee
 which were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon
 Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men. ","And he put forth his hand
 and touched him
 saying
 I will: be thou clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him. ","And he charged him to tell no man: but go
 and shew thyself to the priest
 and offer for thy cleansing
 according as Moses commanded
 for a testimony unto them. ","And when he saw their faith
 he said unto him
 Man
 thy sins are forgiven thee.","But when Jesus perceived their thoughts
 he answering said unto them
 What reason ye in your hearts? ","Whether is easier
 to say
 Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say
 Rise up and walk? ","But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins
 (he said unto the sick of the palsy
) I say unto thee
 Arise
 and take up thy couch
 and go into thine house. ","And after these things he went forth
 and saw a publican
 named Levi
 sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto him
 Follow me. ","And Jesus answering said unto them
 They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick. ","I came not to call the righteous
 but sinners to repentance.","And they said unto him
 Why do the disciples of John fast often
 and make prayers
 and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees; but thine eat and drink? ","And he said unto them
 Can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast
 while the bridegroom is with them? ","But the days will come
 when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them
 and then shall they fast in those days.","And he spake also a parable unto them; No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old; if otherwise
 then both the new maketh a rent
 and the piece that was taken out of the new agreeth not with the old. ","And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine will burst the bottles
 and be spilled
 and the bottles shall perish. ","But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved.","No man also having drunk old wine straightway desireth new: for he saith
 The old is better.","And Jesus answering them said
 Have ye not read so much as this
 what David did
 when himself was an hungred
 and they which were with him; ","how he went into the house of God
 and did take and eat the shewbread
 and gave also to them that were with him; which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone? ","And he said unto them
 That the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.","But he knew their thoughts
 and said to the man which had the withered hand
 Rise up
 and stand forth in the midst. And he arose and stood forth. ","Then said Jesus unto them
 I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good
 or to do evil? to save life
 or to destroy it? ","And looking round about upon them all
 he said unto the man
 Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was restored whole as the other. ","Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed are ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh.","Blessed are ye
 when men shall hate you
 and when they shall separate you from their company
 and shall reproach you
 and cast out your name as evil
 for the Son of man\u2019s sake. ","Rejoice ye in that day
 and leap for joy: for
 behold
 your reward is great in heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets.","But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation.","Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.","Woe unto you
 when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets.","But I say unto you which hear
 Love your enemies
 do good to them which hate you
 ","bless them that curse you
 and pray for them which despitefully use you. ","And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloke forbid not to take thy coat also.","Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again.","And as ye would that men should do to you
 do ye also to them likewise. ","For if ye love them which love you
 what thank have ye? for sinners also love those that love them. ","And if ye do good to them which do good to you
 what thank have ye? for sinners also do even the same. ","And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive
 what thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners
 to receive as much again. ","But love ye your enemies
 and do good
 and lend
 hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great
 and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil. ","Be ye therefore merciful
 as your Father also is merciful. ","Judge not
 and ye shall not be judged: condemn not
 and ye shall not be condemned: forgive
 and ye shall be forgiven: ","give
 and it shall be given unto you; good measure
 pressed down
 and shaken together
 and running over
 shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.","And he spake a parable unto them
 Can the blind lead the blind? shall they not both fall into the ditch? ","The disciple is not above his master: but every one that is perfect shall be as his master.","And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother\u2019s eye
 but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye? ","Either how canst thou say to thy brother
 Brother
 let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye
 when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite
 cast out first the beam out of thine own eye
 and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother\u2019s eye.","For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.","For every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs
 nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes. ","A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.","And why call ye me
 Lord
 Lord
 and do not the things which I say? ","Whosoever cometh to me
 and heareth my sayings
 and doeth them
 I will shew you to whom he is like: ","he is like a man which built an house
 and digged deep
 and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose
 the stream beat vehemently upon that house
 and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock. ","But he that heareth
 and doeth not
 is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently
 and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.","When Jesus heard these things
 he marvelled at him
 and turned him about
 and said unto the people that followed him
 I say unto you
 I have not found so great faith
 no
 not in Israel. ","And when the Lord saw her
 he had compassion on her
 and said unto her
 Weep not. ","And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him stood still. And he said
 Young man
 I say unto thee
 Arise. ","Then Jesus answering said unto them
 Go your way
 and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see
 the lame walk
 the lepers are cleansed
 the deaf hear
 the dead are raised
 to the poor the gospel is preached. ","And blessed is he
 whosoever shall not be offended in me.","And when the messengers of John were departed
 he began to speak unto the people concerning John
 What went ye out into the wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind? ","But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold
 they which are gorgeously apparelled
 and live delicately
 are in kings\u2019 courts. ","But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea
 I say unto you
 and much more than a prophet. ","This is he
 of whom it is written
 Behold
 I send my messenger before thy face
 which shall prepare thy way before thee. ","For I say unto you
 Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he. ","And the Lord said
 Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like? ","They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace
 and calling one to another
 and saying
 We have piped unto you
 and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you
 and ye have not wept. ","For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say
 He hath a devil. ","The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say
 Behold a gluttonous man
 and a winebibber
 a friend of publicans and sinners! ","But wisdom is justified of all her children.","Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it
 he spake within himself
 saying
 This man
 if he were a prophet
 would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him: for she is a sinner. ","And Jesus answering said unto him
 Simon
 I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith
 Master
 say on. ","There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence
 and the other fifty. ","And when they had nothing to pay
 he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore
 which of them will love him most? ","Simon answered and said
 I suppose that he
 to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him
 Thou hast rightly judged. ","And he turned to the woman
 and said unto Simon
 Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house
 thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears
 and wiped them with the hairs of her head. ","Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet.","My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment.","Wherefore I say unto thee
 Her sins
 which are many
 are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven
 the same loveth little. ","And he said unto her
 Thy sins are forgiven. ","And he said to the woman
 Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.","And when much people were gathered together
 and were come to him out of every city
 he spake by a parable: ","A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed
 some fell by the way side; and it was trodden down
 and the fowls of the air devoured it. ","And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up
 it withered away
 because it lacked moisture. ","And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it
 and choked it. ","And other fell on good ground
 and sprang up
 and bare fruit an hundredfold. And when he had said these things
 he cried
 He that hath ears to hear
 let him hear. ","And he said
 Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see
 and hearing they might not understand. ","Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.","Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil
 and taketh away the word out of their hearts
 lest they should believe and be saved. ","They on the rock are they
 which
 when they hear
 receive the word with joy; and these have no root
 which for a while believe
 and in time of temptation fall away. ","And that which fell among thorns are they
 which
 when they have heard
 go forth
 and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life
 and bring no fruit to perfection. ","But that on the good ground are they
 which in an honest and good heart
 having heard the word
 keep it
 and bring forth fruit with patience.","No man
 when he hath lighted a candle
 covereth it with a vessel
 or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a candlestick
 that they which enter in may see the light. ","For nothing is secret
 that shall not be made manifest; neither any thing hid
 that shall not be known and come abroad. ","Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath
 to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not
 from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have.","And it was told him by certain which said
 Thy mother and thy brethren stand without
 desiring to see thee. ","And he answered and said unto them
 My mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God
 and do it.","Now it came to pass on a certain day
 that he went into a ship with his disciples: and he said unto them
 Let us go over unto the other side of the lake. And they launched forth. ","And he said unto them
 Where is your faith? And they being afraid wondered
 saying one to another
 What manner of man is this! for he commandeth even the winds and water
 and they obey him.","And Jesus asked him
 saying
 What is thy name? And he said
 Legion: because many devils were entered into him. ","Return to thine own house
 and shew how great things God hath done unto thee. And he went his way
 and published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him.","And Jesus said
 Who touched me? When all denied
 Peter and they that were with him said
 Master
 the multitude throng thee and press thee
 and sayest thou
 Who touched me? ","And Jesus said
 Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me. ","And he said unto her
 Daughter
 be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.","But when Jesus heard it
 he answered him
 saying
 Fear not: believe only
 and she shall be made whole. ","And all wept
 and bewailed her: but he said
 Weep not; she is not dead
 but sleepeth. ","And he put them all out
 and took her by the hand
 and called
 saying
 Maid
 arise. ","And he said unto them
 Take nothing for your journey
 neither staves
 nor scrip
 neither bread
 neither money; neither have two coats apiece. ","And whatsoever house ye enter into
 there abide
 and thence depart. ","And whosoever will not receive you
 when ye go out of that city
 shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them. ","But he said unto them
 Give ye them to eat. And they said
 We have no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy meat for all this people. ","For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples
 Make them sit down by fifties in a company. ","And it came to pass
 as he was alone praying
 his disciples were with him: and he asked them
 saying
 Whom say the people that I am? ","He said unto them
 But whom say ye that I am? Peter answering said
 The Christ of God. ","saying
 The Son of man must suffer many things
 and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes
 and be slain
 and be raised the third day.","And he said to them all
 If any man will come after me
 let him deny himself
 and take up his cross daily
 and follow me. ","For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his life for my sake
 the same shall save it. ","For what is a man advantaged
 if he gain the whole world
 and lose himself
 or be cast away? ","For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words
 of him shall the Son of man be ashamed
 when he shall come in his own glory
 and in his Father\u2019s
 and of the holy angels. ","But I tell you of a truth
 there be some standing here
 which shall not taste of death
 till they see the kingdom of God.","And it came to pass
 as they departed from him
 Peter said unto Jesus
 Master
 it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee
 and one for Moses
 and one for Elias: not knowing what he said. ","And Jesus answering said
 O faithless and perverse generation
 how long shall I be with you
 and suffer you? Bring thy son hither. ","Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men.","and said unto them
 Whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all
 the same shall be great.","And Jesus said unto him
 Forbid him not: for he that is not against us is for us.","And Jesus said unto him
 Foxes have holes
 and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head. ","And he said unto another
 Follow me. But he said
 Lord
 suffer me first to go and bury my father. ","Jesus said unto him
 Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God. ","And Jesus said unto him
 No man
 having put his hand to the plough
 and looking back
 is fit for the kingdom of God.","Therefore said he unto them
 The harvest truly is great
 but the labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest
 that he would send forth labourers into his harvest. ","Go your ways: behold
 I send you forth as lambs among wolves. ","Carry neither purse
 nor scrip
 nor shoes: and salute no man by the way. ","And into whatsoever house ye enter
 first say
 Peace be to this house. ","And if the son of peace be there
 your peace shall rest upon it: if not
 it shall turn to you again. ","And in the same house remain
 eating and drinking such things as they give: for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house. ","And into whatsoever city ye enter
 and they receive you
 eat such things as are set before you: ","and heal the sick that are therein
 and say unto them
 The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you. ","But into whatsoever city ye enter
 and they receive you not
 go your ways out into the streets of the same
 and say
 ","Even the very dust of your city
 which cleaveth on us
 we do wipe off against you: notwithstanding be ye sure of this
 that the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you. ","But I say unto you
 that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom
 than for that city.","Woe unto thee
 Chorazin! woe unto thee
 Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon
 which have been done in you
 they had a great while ago repented
 sitting in sackcloth and ashes. ","But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment
 than for you. ","And thou
 Capernaum
 which art exalted to heaven
 shalt be thrust down to hell. ","He that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me.","And he said unto them
 I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven. ","Behold
 I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions
 and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you. ","Notwithstanding in this rejoice not
 that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice
 because your names are written in heaven.","In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit
 and said
 I thank thee
 O Father
 Lord of heaven and earth
 that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent
 and hast revealed them unto babes: even so
 Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight. ","All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knoweth who the Son is
 but the Father; and who the Father is
 but the Son
 and he to whom the Son will reveal him.","And he turned him unto his disciples
 and said privately
 Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see: ","for I tell you
 that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see
 and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear
 and have not heard them.","And
 behold
 a certain lawyer stood up
 and tempted him
 saying
 Master
 what shall I do to inherit eternal life? ","He said unto him
 What is written in the law? how readest thou? ","And he said unto him
 Thou hast answered right: this do
 and thou shalt live.","And Jesus answering said
 A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho
 and fell among thieves
 which stripped him of his raiment
 and wounded him
 and departed
 leaving him half dead. ","And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him
 he passed by on the other side. ","And likewise a Levite
 when he was at the place
 came and looked on him
 and passed by on the other side. ","But a certain Samaritan
 as he journeyed
 came where he was: and when he saw him
 he had compassion on him
 ","and went to him
 and bound up his wounds
 pouring in oil and wine
 and set him on his own beast
 and brought him to an inn
 and took care of him. ","And on the morrow when he departed
 he took out two pence
 and gave them to the host
 and said unto him
 Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more
 when I come again
 I will repay thee. ","Which now of these three
 thinkest thou
 was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves? ","And he said
 He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him
 Go
 and do thou likewise.","And Jesus answered and said unto her
 Martha
 Martha
 thou art careful and troubled about many things: ","but one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part
 which shall not be taken away from her.","And it came to pass
 that
 as he was praying in a certain place
 when he ceased
 one of his disciples said unto him
 Lord
 teach us to pray
 as John also taught his disciples. ","And he said unto them
 When ye pray
 say
 Our Father which art in heaven
 Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done
 as in heaven
 so in earth. ","Give us day by day our daily bread.","And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil.","And he said unto them
 Which of you shall have a friend
 and shall go unto him at midnight
 and say unto him
 Friend
 lend me three loaves; ","for a friend of mine in his journey is come to me
 and I have nothing to set before him? ","and he from within shall answer and say
 Trouble me not: the door is now shut
 and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee. ","I say unto you
 Though he will not rise and give him
 because he is his friend
 yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth. ","And I say unto you
 Ask
 and it shall be given you; seek
 and ye shall find; knock
 and it shall be opened unto you. ","For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.","If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father
 will he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish
 will he for a fish give him a serpent? ","Or if he shall ask an egg
 will he offer him a scorpion? ","If ye then
 being evil
 know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?","And he was casting out a devil
 and it was dumb. And it came to pass
 when the devil was gone out
 the dumb spake; and the people wondered. ","But he
 knowing their thoughts
 said unto them
 Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house divided against a house falleth. ","If Satan also be divided against himself
 how shall his kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub. ","And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils
 by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges. ","But if I with the finger of God cast out devils
 no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you. ","When a strong man armed keepeth his palace
 his goods are in peace: ","but when a stronger than he shall come upon him
 and overcome him
 he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted
 and divideth his spoils. ","He that is not with me is against me: and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.","When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man
 he walketh through dry places
 seeking rest; and finding none
 he saith
 I will return unto my house whence I came out. ","And when he cometh
 he findeth it swept and garnished. ","Then goeth he
 and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and they enter in
 and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first.","And it came to pass
 as he spake these things
 a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice
 and said unto him
 Blessed is the womb that bare thee
 and the paps which thou hast sucked. ","But he said
 Yea rather
 blessed are they that hear the word of God
 and keep it.","And when the people were gathered thick together
 he began to say
 This is an evil generation: they seek a sign; and there shall no sign be given it
 but the sign of Jonas the prophet. ","For as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites
 so shall also the Son of man be to this generation. ","The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation
 and condemn them: for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and
 behold
 a greater than Solomon is here. ","The men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this generation
 and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and
 behold
 a greater than Jonas is here.","No man
 when he hath lighted a candle
 putteth it in a secret place
 neither under a bushel
 but on a candlestick
 that they which come in may see the light. ","The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single
 thy whole body also is full of light; but when thine eye is evil
 thy body also is full of darkness. ","Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness.","If thy whole body therefore be full of light
 having no part dark
 the whole shall be full of light
 as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light.","And the Lord said unto him
 Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness. ","Ye fools
 did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also? ","But rather give alms of such things as ye have; and
 behold
 all things are clean unto you. ","But woe unto you
 Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs
 and pass over judgment and the love of God: these ought ye to have done
 and not to leave the other undone. ","Woe unto you
 Pharisees! for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues
 and greetings in the markets. ","Woe unto you
 scribes and Pharisees
 hypocrites! for ye are as graves which appear not
 and the men that walk over them are not aware of them.","And he said
 Woe unto you also
 ye lawyers! for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne
 and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers. ","Woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets
 and your fathers killed them. ","Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers: for they indeed killed them
 and ye build their sepulchres. ","Therefore also said the wisdom of God
 I will send them prophets and apostles
 and some of them they shall slay and persecute: ","that the blood of all the prophets
 which was shed from the foundation of the world
 may be required of this generation; ","from the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias
 which perished between the altar and the temple: verily I say unto you
 It shall be required of this generation. ","Woe unto you
 lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves
 and them that were entering in ye hindered.","In the mean time
 when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people
 insomuch that they trode one upon another
 he began to say unto his disciples first of all
 Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees
 which is hypocrisy. ","For there is nothing covered
 that shall not be revealed; neither hid
 that shall not be known. ","Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.","And I say unto you my friends
 Be not afraid of them that kill the body
 and after that have no more that they can do. ","But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him
 which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea
 I say unto you
 Fear him. ","Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings
 and not one of them is forgotten before God? ","But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows.","Also I say unto you
 Whosoever shall confess me before men
 him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God: ","but he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels of God.","And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man
 it shall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven. ","And when they bring you unto the synagogues
 and unto magistrates
 and powers
 take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer
 or what ye shall say: ","for the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say.","And he said unto him
 Man
 who made me a judge or a divider over you? ","And he said unto them
 Take heed
 and beware of covetousness: for a man\u2019s life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth. ","And he spake a parable unto them
 saying
 The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully: ","and he thought within himself
 saying
 What shall I do
 because I have no room where to bestow my fruits? ","And he said
 This will I do: I will pull down my barns
 and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods. ","And I will say to my soul
 Soul
 thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease
 eat
 drink
 and be merry. ","But God said unto him
 Thou fool
 this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be
 which thou hast provided? ","So is he that layeth up treasure for himself
 and is not rich toward God.","And he said unto his disciples
 Therefore I say unto you
 Take no thought for your life
 what ye shall eat; neither for the body
 what ye shall put on. ","The life is more than meat
 and the body is more than raiment. ","Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth them: how much more are ye better than the fowls?","And which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit?","If ye then be not able to do that thing which is least
 why take ye thought for the rest? ","Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not
 they spin not; and yet I say unto you
 that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. ","If then God so clothe the grass
 which is to day in the field
 and to morrow is cast into the oven; how much more will he clothe you
 O ye of little faith? ","And seek not ye what ye shall eat
 or what ye shall drink
 neither be ye of doubtful mind. ","For all these things do the nations of the world seek after: and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things.","But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things shall be added unto you.","Fear not
 little flock; for it is your Father\u2019s good pleasure to give you the kingdom. ","Sell that ye have
 and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old
 a treasure in the heavens that faileth not
 where no thief approacheth
 neither moth corrupteth. ","For where your treasure is
 there will your heart be also. ","Let your loins be girded about
 and your lights burning; ","and ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord
 when he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh
 they may open unto him immediately. ","Blessed are those servants
 whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching: verily I say unto you
 that he shall gird himself
 and make them to sit down to meat
 and will come forth and serve them. ","And if he shall come in the second watch
 or come in the third watch
 and find them so
 blessed are those servants. ","And this know
 that if the goodman of the house had known what hour the thief would come
 he would have watched
 and not have suffered his house to be broken through. ","Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not.","And the Lord said
 Who then is that faithful and wise steward
 whom his lord shall make ruler over his household
 to give them their portion of meat in due season? ","Blessed is that servant
 whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing. ","Of a truth I say unto you
 that he will make him ruler over all that he hath. ","But and if that servant say in his heart
 My lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens
 and to eat and drink
 and to be drunken; ","the lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him
 and at an hour when he is not aware
 and will cut him in sunder
 and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers. ","And that servant
 which knew his lord\u2019s will
 and prepared not himself
 neither did according to his will
 shall be beaten with many stripes. ","But he that knew not
 and did commit things worthy of stripes
 shall be beaten with few stripes. For unto whomsoever much is given
 of him shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much
 of him they will ask the more.","I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I
 if it be already kindled? ","But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished!","Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you
 Nay; but rather division: ","for from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided
 three against two
 and two against three. ","The father shall be divided against the son
 and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter
 and the daughter against the mother; the mother in law against her daughter in law
 and the daughter in law against her mother in law.","And he said also to the people
 When ye see a cloud rise out of the west
 straightway ye say
 There cometh a shower; and so it is. ","And when ye see the south wind blow
 ye say
 There will be heat; and it cometh to pass. ","Ye hypocrites
 ye can discern the face of the sky and of the earth; but how is it that ye do not discern this time?","Yea
 and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right? ","When thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate
 as thou art in the way
 give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him; lest he hale thee to the judge
 and the judge deliver thee to the officer
 and the officer cast thee into prison. ","I tell thee
 thou shalt not depart thence
 till thou hast paid the very last mite.","And Jesus answering said unto them
 Suppose ye that these Galil\u00e6ans were sinners above all the Galil\u00e6ans
 because they suffered such things? ","I tell you
 Nay: but
 except ye repent
 ye shall all likewise perish. ","Or those eighteen
 upon whom the tower in Siloam fell
 and slew them
 think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem? ","I tell you
 Nay: but
 except ye repent
 ye shall all likewise perish.","He spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon
 and found none. ","Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard
 Behold
 these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree
 and find none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground? ","And he answering said unto him
 Lord
 let it alone this year also
 till I shall dig about it
 and dung it: ","and if it bear fruit
 well: and if not
 then after that thou shalt cut it down.","And when Jesus saw her
 he called her to him
 and said unto her
 Woman
 thou art loosed from thine infirmity. ","The Lord then answered him
 and said
 Thou hypocrite
 doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall
 and lead him away to watering? ","And ought not this woman
 being a daughter of Abraham
 whom Satan hath bound
 lo
 these eighteen years
 be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day? ","Then said he
 Unto what is the kingdom of God like? and whereunto shall I resemble it? ","It is like a grain of mustard seed
 which a man took
 and cast into his garden; and it grew
 and waxed a great tree; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it. ","And again he said
 Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God? ","It is like leaven
 which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal
 till the whole was leavened.","Then said one unto him
 Lord
 are there few that be saved? And he said unto them
 ","Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many
 I say unto you
 will seek to enter in
 and shall not be able. ","When once the master of the house is risen up
 and hath shut to the door
 and ye begin to stand without
 and to knock at the door
 saying
 Lord
 Lord
 open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto you
 I know you not whence ye are: ","then shall ye begin to say
 We have eaten and drunk in thy presence
 and thou hast taught in our streets. ","But he shall say
 I tell you
 I know you not whence ye are; depart from me
 all ye workers of iniquity. ","There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth
 when ye shall see Abraham
 and Isaac
 and Jacob
 and all the prophets
 in the kingdom of God
 and you yourselves thrust out. ","And they shall come from the east
 and from the west
 and from the north
 and from the south
 and shall sit down in the kingdom of God. ","And
 behold
 there are last which shall be first
 and there are first which shall be last.","And he said unto them
 Go ye
 and tell that fox
 Behold
 I cast out devils
 and I do cures to day and to morrow
 and the third day I shall be perfected. ","Nevertheless I must walk to day
 and to morrow
 and the day following: for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem. ","O Jerusalem
 Jerusalem
 which killest the prophets
 and stonest them that are sent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy children together
 as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings
 and ye would not! ","Behold
 your house is left unto you desolate: and verily I say unto you
 Ye shall not see me
 until the time come when ye shall say
 Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.","And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees
 saying
 Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day? ","and answered them
 saying
 Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit
 and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day? ","When thou art bidden of any man to a wedding
 sit not down in the highest room; lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him; ","and he that bade thee and him come and say to thee
 Give this man place; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room. ","But when thou art bidden
 go and sit down in the lowest room; that when he that bade thee cometh
 he may say unto thee
 Friend
 go up higher: then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee. ","For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.","Then said he also to him that bade him
 When thou makest a dinner or a supper
 call not thy friends
 nor thy brethren
 neither thy kinsmen
 nor thy rich neighbours; lest they also bid thee again
 and a recompence be made thee. ","But when thou makest a feast
 call the poor
 the maimed
 the lame
 the blind: ","and thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.","And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things
 he said unto him
 Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God. ","Then said he unto him
 A certain man made a great supper
 and bade many: ","and sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden
 Come; for all things are now ready. ","And they all with one consent began to make excuse. The first said unto him
 I have bought a piece of ground
 and I must needs go and see it: I pray thee have me excused. ","And another said
 I have bought five yoke of oxen
 and I go to prove them: I pray thee have me excused. ","And another said
 I have married a wife
 and therefore I cannot come. ","So that servant came
 and shewed his lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant
 Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city
 and bring in hither the poor
 and the maimed
 and the halt
 and the blind. ","And the servant said
 Lord
 it is done as thou hast commanded
 and yet there is room. ","And the lord said unto the servant
 Go out into the highways and hedges
 and compel them to come in
 that my house may be filled. ","For I say unto you
 That none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper.","And there went great multitudes with him: and he turned
 and said unto them
 ","If any man come to me
 and hate not his father
 and mother
 and wife
 and children
 and brethren
 and sisters
 yea
 and his own life also
 he cannot be my disciple. ","And whosoever doth not bear his cross
 and come after me
 cannot be my disciple. ","For which of you
 intending to build a tower
 sitteth not down first
 and counteth the cost
 whether he have sufficient to finish it? ","lest haply
 after he hath laid the foundation
 and is not able to finish it
 all that behold it begin to mock him
 ","saying
 This man began to build
 and was not able to finish. ","Or what king
 going to make war against another king
 sitteth not down first
 and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand? ","Or else
 while the other is yet a great way off
 he sendeth an ambassage
 and desireth conditions of peace. ","So likewise
 whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath
 he cannot be my disciple.","Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his savour
 wherewith shall it be seasoned? ","It is neither fit for the land
 nor yet for the dunghill; but men cast it out. He that hath ears to hear
 let him hear.","What man of you
 having an hundred sheep
 if he lose one of them
 doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness
 and go after that which is lost
 until he find it? ","And when he hath found it
 he layeth it on his shoulders
 rejoicing. ","And when he cometh home
 he calleth together his friends and neighbours
 saying unto them
 Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost. ","I say unto you
 that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth
 more than over ninety and nine just persons
 which need no repentance.","Either what woman having ten pieces of silver
 if she lose one piece
 doth not light a candle
 and sweep the house
 and seek diligently till she find it? ","And when she hath found it
 she calleth her friends and her neighbours together
 saying
 Rejoice with me; for I have found the piece which I had lost. ","Likewise
 I say unto you
 there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.","And he said
 A certain man had two sons: ","and the younger of them said to his father
 Father
 give me the portion of goods that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his living. ","And not many days after the younger son gathered all together
 and took his journey into a far country
 and there wasted his substance with riotous living. ","And when he had spent all
 there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want. ","And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.","And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.","And when he came to himself
 he said
 How many hired servants of my father\u2019s have bread enough and to spare
 and I perish with hunger! ","I will arise and go to my father
 and will say unto him
 Father
 I have sinned against heaven
 and before thee
 ","and am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.","And he arose
 and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off
 his father saw him
 and had compassion
 and ran
 and fell on his neck
 and kissed him. ","And the son said unto him
 Father
 I have sinned against heaven
 and in thy sight
 and am no more worthy to be called thy son. ","But the father said to his servants
 Bring forth the best robe
 and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand
 and shoes on his feet: ","and bring hither the fatted calf
 and kill it; and let us eat
 and be merry: ","for this my son was dead
 and is alive again; he was lost
 and is found. And they began to be merry.","Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house
 he heard musick and dancing. ","And he called one of the servants
 and asked what these things meant. ","And he said unto him
 Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf
 because he hath received him safe and sound. ","And he was angry
 and would not go in: therefore came his father out
 and intreated him. ","And he answering said to his father
 Lo
 these many years do I serve thee
 neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid
 that I might make merry with my friends: ","but as soon as this thy son was come
 which hath devoured thy living with harlots
 thou hast killed for him the fatted calf. ","And he said unto him
 Son
 thou art ever with me
 and all that I have is thine. ","It was meet that we should make merry
 and be glad: for this thy brother was dead
 and is alive again; and was lost
 and is found.","And he said also unto his disciples
 There was a certain rich man
 which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods. ","And he called him
 and said unto him
 How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward. ","Then the steward said within himself
 What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed. ","I am resolved what to do
 that
 when I am put out of the stewardship
 they may receive me into their houses. ","So he called every one of his lord\u2019s debtors unto him
 and said unto the first
 How much owest thou unto my lord? ","And he said
 An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him
 Take thy bill
 and sit down quickly
 and write fifty. ","Then said he to another
 And how much owest thou? And he said
 An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him
 Take thy bill
 and write fourscore. ","And the lord commended the unjust steward
 because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light. ","And I say unto you
 Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that
 when ye fail
 they may receive you into everlasting habitations. ","He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.","If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon
 who will commit to your trust the true riches? ","And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man\u2019s
 who shall give you that which is your own? ","No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one
 and love the other; or else he will hold to the one
 and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.","And he said unto them
 Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God. ","The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached
 and every man presseth into it. ","And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass
 than one tittle of the law to fail. ","Whosoever putteth away his wife
 and marrieth another
 committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth adultery.","There was a certain rich man
 which was clothed in purple and fine linen
 and fared sumptuously every day: ","and there was a certain beggar named Lazarus
 which was laid at his gate
 full of sores
 ","and desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man\u2019s table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.","And it came to pass
 that the beggar died
 and was carried by the angels into Abraham\u2019s bosom: the rich man also died
 and was buried; ","and in hell he lift up his eyes
 being in torments
 and seeth Abraham afar off
 and Lazarus in his bosom. ","And he cried and said
 Father Abraham
 have mercy on me
 and send Lazarus
 that he may dip the tip of his finger in water
 and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame. ","But Abraham said
 Son
 remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things
 and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted
 and thou art tormented. ","And beside all this
 between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us
 that would come from thence. ","Then he said
 I pray thee therefore
 father
 that thou wouldest send him to my father\u2019s house: ","for I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them
 lest they also come into this place of torment. ","Abraham saith unto him
 They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them. ","And he said
 Nay
 father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead
 they will repent. ","And he said unto him
 If they hear not Moses and the prophets
 neither will they be persuaded
 though one rose from the dead.","Then said he unto the disciples
 It is impossible but that offences will come: but woe unto him
 through whom they come! ","It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck
 and he cast into the sea
 than that he should offend one of these little ones. ","Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee
 rebuke him; and if he repent
 forgive him. ","And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day
 and seven times in a day turn again to thee
 saying
 I repent; thou shalt forgive him.","And the Lord said
 If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed
 ye might say unto this sycamine tree
 Be thou plucked up by the root
 and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you. ","But which of you
 having a servant plowing or feeding cattle
 will say unto him by and by
 when he is come from the field
 Go and sit down to meat? ","And will not rather say unto him
 Make ready wherewith I may sup
 and gird thyself
 and serve me
 till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink? ","Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not.","So likewise ye
 when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you
 say
 We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do.","And it came to pass
 as he went to Jerusalem
 that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee. ","And when he saw them
 he said unto them
 Go shew yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass
 that
 as they went
 they were cleansed. ","And Jesus answering said
 Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine? ","There are not found that returned to give glory to God
 save this stranger. ","And he said unto him
 Arise
 go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole.","And when he was demanded of the Pharisees
 when the kingdom of God should come
 he answered them and said
 The kingdom of God cometh not with observation: ","neither shall they say
 Lo here! or
 lo there! for
 behold
 the kingdom of God is within you.","And he said unto the disciples
 The days will come
 when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man
 and ye shall not see it. ","And they shall say to you
 See here; or
 see there: go not after them
 nor follow them. ","For as the lightning
 that lighteneth out of the one part under heaven
 shineth unto the other part under heaven; so shall also the Son of man be in his day. ","But first must he suffer many things
 and be rejected of this generation.","And as it was in the days of Noe
 so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man. ","They did eat
 they drank
 they married wives
 they were given in marriage
 until the day that Noe entered into the ark
 and the flood came
 and destroyed them all. ","Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat
 they drank
 they bought
 they sold
 they planted
 they builded; ","but the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven
 and destroyed them all. ","Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.","In that day
 he which shall be upon the housetop
 and his stuff in the house
 let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field
 let him likewise not return back. ","Remember Lot\u2019s wife.","Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.","I tell you
 in that night there shall be two men in one bed; the one shall be taken
 and the other shall be left. ","Two women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken
 and the other left. ","And they answered and said unto him
 Where
 Lord? And he said unto them
 Wheresoever the body is
 thither will the eagles be gathered together.","saying
 There was in a city a judge
 which feared not God
 neither regarded man: ","and there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him
 saying
 Avenge me of mine adversary. ","And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself
 Though I fear not God
 nor regard man; ","yet because this widow troubleth me
 I will avenge her
 lest by her continual coming she weary me. ","And the Lord said
 Hear what the unjust judge saith. ","And shall not God avenge his own elect
 which cry day and night unto him
 though he bear long with them? ","I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh
 shall he find faith on the earth?","Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee
 and the other a publican. ","The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself
 God
 I thank thee
 that I am not as other men are
 extortioners
 unjust
 adulterers
 or even as this publican. ","I fast twice in the week
 I give tithes of all that I possess. ","And the publican
 standing afar off
 would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven
 but smote upon his breast
 saying
 God be merciful to me a sinner. ","I tell you
 this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.","But Jesus called them unto him
 and said
 Suffer little children to come unto me
 and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God. ","Verily I say unto you
 Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.","And Jesus said unto him
 Why callest thou me good? none is good
 save one
 that is
 God. ","Thou knowest the commandments
 Do not commit adultery
 Do not kill
 Do not steal
 Do not bear false witness
 Honour thy father and thy mother. ","And he said
 All these have I kept from my youth up. ","Now when Jesus heard these things
 he said unto him
 Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast
 and distribute unto the poor
 and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come
 follow me. ","And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful
 he said
 How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God! ","For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle\u2019s eye
 than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. ","And he said
 The things which are impossible with men are possible with God. ","And he said unto them
 Verily I say unto you
 There is no man that hath left house
 or parents
 or brethren
 or wife
 or children
 for the kingdom of God\u2019s sake
 ","who shall not receive manifold more in this present time
 and in the world to come life everlasting.","Then he took unto him the twelve
 and said unto them
 Behold
 we go up to Jerusalem
 and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished. ","For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles
 and shall be mocked
 and spitefully entreated
 and spitted on: ","and they shall scourge him
 and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise again. ","And they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them
 neither knew they the things which were spoken.","saying
 What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And he said
 Lord
 that I may receive my sight. ","And Jesus said unto him
 Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee. ","And when Jesus came to the place
 he looked up
 and saw him
 and said unto him
 Zacch\u00e6us
 make haste
 and come down; for to day I must abide at thy house. ","And Zacch\u00e6us stood
 and said unto the Lord; Behold
 Lord
 the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation
 I restore him fourfold. ","And Jesus said unto him
 This day is salvation come to this house
 forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham. ","For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.","He said therefore
 A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom
 and to return. ","And he called his ten servants
 and delivered them ten pounds
 and said unto them
 Occupy till I come. ","But his citizens hated him
 and sent a message after him
 saying
 We will not have this man to reign over us. ","And it came to pass
 that when he was returned
 having received the kingdom
 then he commanded these servants to be called unto him
 to whom he had given the money
 that he might know how much every man had gained by trading. ","Then came the first
 saying
 Lord
 thy pound hath gained ten pounds. ","And he said unto him
 Well
 thou good servant: because thou hast been faithful in a very little
 have thou authority over ten cities. ","And the second came
 saying
 Lord
 thy pound hath gained five pounds. ","And he said likewise to him
 Be thou also over five cities. ","And another came
 saying
 Lord
 behold
 here is thy pound
 which I have kept laid up in a napkin: ","for I feared thee
 because thou art an austere man: thou takest up that thou layedst not down
 and reapest that thou didst not sow. ","And he saith unto him
 Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee
 thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere man
 taking up that I laid not down
 and reaping that I did not sow: ","wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank
 that at my coming I might have required mine own with usury? ","And he said unto them that stood by
 Take from him the pound
 and give it to him that hath ten pounds. ","(And they said unto him
 Lord
 he hath ten pounds.) ","For I say unto you
 That unto every one which hath shall be given; and from him that hath not
 even that he hath shall be taken away from him. ","But those mine enemies
 which would not that I should reign over them
 bring hither
 and slay them before me.","saying
 Go ye into the village over against you; in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied
 whereon yet never man sat: loose him
 and bring him hither. ","And if any man ask you
 Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say unto him
 Because the Lord hath need of him. ","And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him
 Master
 rebuke thy disciples. ","And he answered and said unto them
 I tell you that
 if these should hold their peace
 the stones would immediately cry out.","saying
 If thou hadst known
 even thou
 at least in this thy day
 the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes. ","For the days shall come upon thee
 that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee
 and compass thee round
 and keep thee in on every side
 ","and shall lay thee even with the ground
 and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.","saying unto them
 It is written
 My house is the house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of thieves.","And he answered and said unto them
 I will also ask you one thing; and answer me: ","The baptism of John
 was it from heaven
 or of men? ","And Jesus said unto them
 Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.","Then began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain man planted a vineyard
 and let it forth to husbandmen
 and went into a far country for a long time. ","And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen
 that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat him
 and sent him away empty. ","And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also
 and entreated him shamefully
 and sent him away empty. ","And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also
 and cast him out. ","Then said the lord of the vineyard
 What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: it may be they will reverence him when they see him. ","But when the husbandmen saw him
 they reasoned among themselves
 saying
 This is the heir: come
 let us kill him
 that the inheritance may be ours. ","So they cast him out of the vineyard
 and killed him. What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them? ","He shall come and destroy these husbandmen
 and shall give the vineyard to others. And when they heard it
 they said
 God forbid. ","And he beheld them
 and said
 What is this then that is written
 The stone which the builders rejected
 the same is become the head of the corner? ","Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall
 it will grind him to powder.","And they watched him
 and sent forth spies
 which should feign themselves just men
 that they might take hold of his words
 that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor. ","Shew me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it? They answered and said
 C\u00e6sar\u2019s. ","And he said unto them
 Render therefore unto C\u00e6sar the things which be C\u00e6sar\u2019s
 and unto God the things which be God\u2019s. ","And they could not take hold of his words before the people: and they marvelled at his answer
 and held their peace.","And Jesus answering said unto them
 The children of this world marry
 and are given in marriage: ","but they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world
 and the resurrection from the dead
 neither marry
 nor are given in marriage: ","neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God
 being the children of the resurrection. ","Now that the dead are raised
 even Moses shewed at the bush
 when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham
 and the God of Isaac
 and the God of Jacob. ","For he is not a God of the dead
 but of the living: for all live unto him.","And he said unto them
 How say they that Christ is David\u2019s son? ","And David himself saith in the book of Psalms
 The Lord said unto my Lord
 Sit thou on my right hand
 ","till I make thine enemies thy footstool.","David therefore calleth him Lord
 how is he then his son?","Beware of the scribes
 which desire to walk in long robes
 and love greetings in the markets
 and the highest seats in the synagogues
 and the chief rooms at feasts; ","which devour widows\u2019 houses
 and for a shew make long prayers: the same shall receive greater damnation.","And he said
 Of a truth I say unto you
 that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all: ","for all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of God: but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had.","As for these things which ye behold
 the days will come
 in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another
 that shall not be thrown down. ","And he said
 Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall come in my name
 saying
 I am Christ; and the time draweth near: go ye not therefore after them. ","But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions
 be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the end is not by and by.","Then said he unto them
 Nation shall rise against nation
 and kingdom against kingdom: ","and great earthquakes shall be in divers places
 and famines
 and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven. ","But before all these
 they shall lay their hands on you
 and persecute you
 delivering you up to the synagogues
 and into prisons
 being brought before kings and rulers for my name\u2019s sake. ","And it shall turn to you for a testimony.","Settle it therefore in your hearts
 not to meditate before what ye shall answer: ","for I will give you a mouth and wisdom
 which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist. ","And ye shall be betrayed both by parents
 and brethren
 and kinsfolks
 and friends; and some of you shall they cause to be put to death. ","And ye shall be hated of all men for my name\u2019s sake.","But there shall not an hair of your head perish.","In your patience possess ye your souls.","And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies
 then know that the desolation thereof is nigh. ","Then let them which are in Jud\u00e6a flee to the mountains; and let them which are in the midst of it depart out; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto.","For these be the days of vengeance
 that all things which are written may be fulfilled. ","But woe unto them that are with child
 and to them that give suck
 in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land
 and wrath upon this people. ","And they shall fall by the edge of the sword
 and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles
 until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled. ","And there shall be signs in the sun
 and in the moon
 and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations
 with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring; ","men\u2019s hearts failing them for fear
 and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken. ","And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.","And when these things begin to come to pass
 then look up
 and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.","And he spake to them a parable; Behold the fig tree
 and all the trees; ","when they now shoot forth
 ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand. ","So likewise ye
 when ye see these things come to pass
 know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand. ","Verily I say unto you
 This generation shall not pass away
 till all be fulfilled. ","Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.","And take heed to yourselves
 lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting
 and drunkenness
 and cares of this life
 and so that day come upon you unawares. ","For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth.","Watch ye therefore
 and pray always
 that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass
 and to stand before the Son of man.","And he sent Peter and John
 saying
 Go and prepare us the passover
 that we may eat. ","And he said unto them
 Behold
 when ye are entered into the city
 there shall a man meet you
 bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he entereth in. ","And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house
 The Master saith unto thee
 Where is the guestchamber
 where I shall eat the passover with my disciples? ","And he shall shew you a large upper room furnished: there make ready.","And he said unto them
 With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer: ","for I say unto you
 I will not any more eat thereof
 until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God. ","And he took the cup
 and gave thanks
 and said
 Take this
 and divide it among yourselves: ","for I say unto you
 I will not drink of the fruit of the vine
 until the kingdom of God shall come.","And he took bread
 and gave thanks
 and brake it
 and gave unto them
 saying
 This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me. ","Likewise also the cup after supper
 saying
 This cup is the new testament in my blood
 which is shed for you.","But
 behold
 the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table. ","And truly the Son of man goeth
 as it was determined: but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed! ","And he said unto them
 The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors. ","But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you
 let him be as the younger; and he that is chief
 as he that doth serve. ","For whether is greater
 he that sitteth at meat
 or he that serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as he that serveth. ","Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations.","And I appoint unto you a kingdom
 as my Father hath appointed unto me; ","that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom
 and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.","And the Lord said
 Simon
 Simon
 behold
 Satan hath desired to have you
 that he may sift you as wheat: ","but I have prayed for thee
 that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted
 strengthen thy brethren. ","And he said unto him
 Lord
 I am ready to go with thee
 both into prison
 and to death. ","And he said
 I tell thee
 Peter
 the cock shall not crow this day
 before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.","And he said unto them
 When I sent you without purse
 and scrip
 and shoes
 lacked ye any thing? And they said
 Nothing. ","Then said he unto them
 But now
 he that hath a purse
 let him take it
 and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no sword
 let him sell his garment
 and buy one. ","For I say unto you
 that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me
 And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end. ","And they said
 Lord
 behold
 here are two swords. And he said unto them
 It is enough.","And when he was at the place
 he said unto them
 Pray that ye enter not into temptation. ","saying
 Father
 if thou be willing
 remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will
 but thine
 be done. ","and said unto them
 Why sleep ye? rise and pray
 lest ye enter into temptation.","But Jesus said unto him
 Judas
 betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss? ","And Jesus answered and said
 Suffer ye thus far. And he touched his ear
 and healed him. ","Then Jesus said unto the chief priests
 and captains of the temple
 and the elders
 which were come to him
 Be ye come out
 as against a thief
 with swords and staves? ","When I was daily with you in the temple
 ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour
 and the power of darkness.","And the Lord turned
 and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord
 how he had said unto him
 Before the cock crow
 thou shalt deny me thrice. ","Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them
 If I tell you
 ye will not believe: ","and if I also ask you
 ye will not answer me
 nor let me go. ","Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God.","Then said they all
 Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them
 Ye say that I am. ","And Pilate asked him
 saying
 Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said
 Thou sayest it. ","When Pilate heard of Galilee
 he asked whether the man were a Galil\u00e6an. ","said unto them
 Ye have brought this man unto me
 as one that perverteth the people: and
 behold
 I
 having examined him before you
 have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him: ","And he said unto them the third time
 Why
 what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him
 and let him go. ","But Jesus turning unto them said
 Daughters of Jerusalem
 weep not for me
 but weep for yourselves
 and for your children. ","For
 behold
 the days are coming
 in the which they shall say
 Blessed are the barren
 and the wombs that never bare
 and the paps which never gave suck. ","Then shall they begin to say to the mountains
 Fall on us; and to the hills
 Cover us. ","For if they do these things in a green tree
 what shall be done in the dry?","Then said Jesus
 Father
 forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment
 and cast lots. ","And Jesus said unto him
 Verily I say unto thee
 To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.","And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice
 he said
 Father
 into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus
 he gave up the ghost. ","and as they were afraid
 and bowed down their faces to the earth
 they said unto them
 Why seek ye the living among the dead? ","And he said unto them
 What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another
 as ye walk
 and are sad? ","And he said unto them
 What things? And they said unto him
 Concerning Jesus of Nazareth
 which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people: ","Then he said unto them
 O fools
 and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken: ","ought not Christ to have suffered these things
 and to enter into his glory? ","And as they thus spake
 Jesus himself stood in the midst of them
 and saith unto them
 Peace be unto you. ","And he said unto them
 Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts? ","Behold my hands and my feet
 that it is I myself: handle me
 and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones
 as ye see me have. ","And while they yet believed not for joy
 and wondered
 he said unto them
 Have ye here any meat? ","And he said unto them
 These are the words which I spake unto you
 while I was yet with you
 that all things must be fulfilled
 which were written in the law of Moses
 and in the prophets
 and in the psalms
 concerning me. ","and said unto them
 Thus it is written
 and thus it behoved Christ to suffer
 and to rise from the dead the third day: ","and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations
 beginning at Jerusalem. ","And ye are witnesses of these things.","And
 behold
 I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem
 until ye be endued with power from on high.","And He answered
 \u201cWhy did you have to look for Me? Did you not know that I had to be in My Father\u2019s house?\u201d ","Jesus replied to him
 \u201cIt is written and forever remains written
 \u2018Man shall not live by bread alone.\u2019\u201d","And the devil said to Him
 \u201cI will give You all this realm and its glory [its power
 its renown]; because it has been handed over to me
 and I give it to whomever I wish. ","Jesus replied to him
 \u201cIt is written and forever remains written
 \u2018You shall worship the Lord your God and serve only Him.\u2019\u201d","Then he led Jesus to Jerusalem and had Him stand on the pinnacle (highest point) of the temple
 and said  to Him
 \u201cIf You are the Son of God
 throw Yourself down from here; ","Jesus replied to him
 \u201cIt is said [in Scripture]
 \u2018you shall not tempt the Lord your God [to prove Himself to you].\u2019\u201d"," \u201cThe Spirit of the Lord is upon Me (the Messiah)
 Because He has anointed Me to preach the good news to the poor. He has sent Me to announce release (pardon
 forgiveness) to the captives
 And recovery of sight to the blind
 To set free those who are oppressed (downtrodden
 bruised
 crushed by tragedy)
","to proclaim the favorable year of the Lord [the day when salvation and the favor of God abound greatly].\u201d","He began speaking to them: \u201cToday this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing and in your presence.\u201d","So He said to them
 \u201cYou will no doubt quote this proverb to Me
 \u2018Physician
 heal Yourself! Whatever  that we heard were done [by You] in Capernaum
 do here in Your hometown as well.\u2019\u201d ","Then He said
 \u201cI assure you and most solemnly say to you
 no prophet is welcome in his hometown. ","But in truth I say to you
 there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah
 when the sky was closed up for three years and six months
 when a great famine came over all the land; ","and yet Elijah was not sent [by the Lord] to a single one of them
 but only to Zarephath in the land of Sidon
 to a woman who was a widow. ","And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet; and not one of them was cleansed [by being healed] except Naaman the Syrian.\u201d","and they were surprised [almost overwhelmed] at His teaching
 because His message was  with authority and power and great ability. ","But Jesus rebuked him
 saying
 \u201cBe silent (muzzled
 gagged) and come out of him!\u201d And when the demon had thrown the man down among them
 he came out of him without injuring him in any way. ","Demons also were coming out of many people
 shouting
 \u201cYou are the Son of God!\u201d But He rebuked them and would not allow them to speak
 because they knew that He was the Christ (the Messiah
 the Anointed).","But He said
 \u201cI must preach [the good news of] the kingdom of God to the other cities also
 because I was sent for this purpose.\u201d","When He had finished speaking
 He said to Simon 
 \u201cPut out into the deep water and lower your nets for a catch [of fish].\u201d ","and so were James and John
 sons of Zebedee
 who were partners with Simon . Jesus said to Simon
 \u201cHave no fear; from now on you will be catching men!\u201d ","And Jesus reached out His hand and touched him
 saying
 \u201cI am willing; be cleansed.\u201d And immediately the leprosy left him. ","Jesus ordered him to tell no one [that he might happen to meet]
 \u201cBut go and show yourself to the priest
 and make an offering for your purification
 just as Moses commanded
 as a testimony (witness) to them [that this is a work of Messiah].\u201d ","When Jesus saw their  faith [springing from confidence in Him]
 He said
 \u201cMan
 your sins are forgiven.\u201d ","But Jesus
 knowing their  thoughts
 answered them
 \u201cWhy are you questioning [these things] in your hearts? ","Which is easier
 to say
 \u2018Your sins are forgiven you
\u2019 or to say
 \u2018Get up and walk\u2019? ","But
 in order that you may know that the Son of Man (the Messiah) has authority and power on earth to forgive sins\u201d\u2014He said to the paralyzed man
 \u201cI say to you
 get up
 pick up your stretcher and go home.\u201d ","After this Jesus went out and noticed a tax collector named Levi (Matthew) sitting at the tax booth; and He said to him
 \u201cFollow Me [as My disciple
 accepting Me as your Master and Teacher and walking the same path of life that I walk].\u201d ","And Jesus replied to them
 \u201cIt is not those who are healthy who need a physician
 but  those who are sick. ","I did not come to call the [self-proclaimed] righteous [who see no need to repent]
 but sinners to repentance [to change their old way of thinking
 to turn from sin and to seek God and His righteousness].\u201d","Then they said to Him
 \u201cThe disciples of John [the Baptist] often practice fasting and offer prayers [of special petition]
 and so do the disciples of the Pharisees; but Yours eat and drink.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cCan you make the wedding guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them? ","But days [for mourning] will come when the bridegroom is  taken away from them. They will fast in those days.\u201d","He also told them a parable: \u201cNo one tears a piece of cloth from a new garment and puts it on an old one; otherwise he will both tear the new
 and the piece from the new will not match the old. ","And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; otherwise the new  wine will [expand and] burst the skins and it will be spilled out
 and the skins will be ruined. ","But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins.","And no one
 after drinking old wine
 wishes for new; for he says
 \u2018The old is fine.\u2019\u201d","Jesus replied to them
 \u201cHave you not even read [in the Scriptures] what David did when he was hungry

 and took and ate the consecrated bread

 \u201cThe Son of Man (the Messiah) is Lord  of the Sabbath.\u201d","But He was aware of their thoughts
 and He said to the man with the withered hand
 \u201cGet up and come forward.\u201d So he got up and stood there. ","Then Jesus said to them
 \u201cI ask you directly: Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath or to do evil
 to save a life or to destroy it?\u201d ","After looking around at them all
 He said to the man
 \u201cStretch out your hand!\u201d And he did
 and his hand was  restored. ","Blessed [joyful
 nourished by God\u2019s goodness] are you who hunger now [for righteousness
 actively seeking right standing with God]

 refreshed by God\u2019s grace] are you who weep now [over your sins and repent]
 for you will laugh [when the burden of sin is lifted]. ","Blessed [morally courageous and spiritually alive with life-joy in God\u2019s goodness] are you when people hate you
 and exclude you [from their fellowship]
 and insult you
 and scorn your name as evil because of [your association with] the Son of Man. ","Rejoice on that day and leap for joy
 for your reward in heaven is great [absolutely inexhaustible]; for their fathers used to treat the prophets in the same way. ","But woe (judgment is coming) to you who are rich [and place your faith in possessions while remaining spiritually impoverished]
 for you are  receiving your comfort in full [and there is nothing left to be awarded to you]. ","Woe to you who are well-fed (gorged
 satiated) now
 for you will be hungry. Woe to you who laugh now [enjoying a life of self-indulgence]
 for you will mourn and weep [and deeply long for God]. ","Woe to you when all the people speak well of you and praise you
 for their fathers used to treat the false prophets in the same way.","\u201cBut I say to you who hear [Me and pay attention to My words]: Love [that is
 unselfishly seek the best or higher good for] your enemies
 [make it a practice to] do good to those who hate you
 ","bless and show kindness to those who curse you
 pray for those who mistreat you. ","Whoever strikes you on the cheek
 offer him the other one also [simply ignore insignificant insults or losses and do not bother to retaliate\u2014maintain your dignity]. Whoever takes away your coat
 do not withhold your shirt from him either. ","Give to everyone who asks of you. Whoever takes away what is yours
 do not demand it back. ","Treat others the same way you want them to treat you.","If you  love those who love you
 what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them. ","If you do good to those who do good to you
 what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same. ","If you lend  to those from whom you expect to receive [it back]
 what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners expecting to receive back the same amount. ","But love [that is
 unselfishly seek the best or higher good for] your enemies
 and do good
 and lend
 expecting nothing in return; for your reward will be great (rich
 abundant)
 and you will be sons of the Most High; because He Himself is kind and gracious and good to the ungrateful and the wicked. ","Be merciful (responsive
 compassionate
 tender) just as your  Father is merciful.","\u201cDo not judge [others self-righteously]
 and you will not be judged; do not condemn [others when you are guilty and unrepentant]

 and it will be given to you. They will pour into your lap a good measure\u2014pressed down
 shaken together
 and running over [with no space left for more]. For with the standard of measurement you use [when you do good to others]
 it will be measured to you in return.\u201d","He also told them a parable: \u201cCan a blind man guide  blind man? Will they not both fall into a hole in the ground?","A student is not superior to his teacher; but everyone
 after he has been completely trained
 will be like his teacher. ","Why do you look at the speck that is in your brother\u2019s eye

 first take the log out of your own eye
 and then you will see clearly to take out the speck that is in your brother\u2019s eye. ","For there is no good tree which produces bad fruit
 nor
 on the other hand
 a bad tree which produces good fruit. ","For each tree is known and identified by its own fruit. For figs are not picked from thorn bushes
 nor is a cluster of grapes picked from a briar bush. ","The  good man produces what is good and honorable and moral out of the good treasure  in his heart; and the  evil man produces what is wicked and depraved out of the evil [in his heart]; for his mouth speaks from the overflow of his heart.","\u201cWhy do you call Me
 \u2018Lord
 Lord
\u2019 and do not practice what I tell you? ","Everyone who comes to Me and listens to My words and obeys them

 practical
 and sensible] man building a house
 who dug deep and laid a foundation on the rock; and when a flood occurred
 the torrent burst against that house and yet could not shake it
 because it had been securely built and founded on the rock. ","But the one who has  heard and has not practiced [what I say]
 is like a  man who built a house on the ground without any foundation
 and the torrent burst against it; and it immediately collapsed
 and the ruin of that house was great.\u201d","Now when Jesus heard this
 He was amazed at him
 and turned and said to the crowd that was following Him

 not even in Israel have I found such great faith [as this man\u2019s].\u201d ","When the Lord saw her
 He felt  compassion for her
 and said to her
 \u201cDo not weep.\u201d ","And He came up and touched the bier [on which the body rested]
 and the pallbearers stood still. And He said
 \u201cYoung man

 spiritually favored] is he who does not take offense at Me.\u201d","When John\u2019s messengers left
 Jesus began speaking to the crowds about John: \u201cWhat did you go out to the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? ","But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing [entirely unsuited for the harsh wilderness]? Those who wear splendid clothing and live in luxury are in royal palaces!","But what did you  go out to see? A prophet?

 I say to you
 and one far more [eminent and remarkable] than a prophet [who foretells the future]. ","This is the one of whom it is written [by the prophet Malachi]

 I send My messenger ahead of You
 Who will prepare Your way before You.\u2019","I tell you
 among those born of women there is no one greater than John; yet he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater [in privilege] than he.\u201d ","\u201cTo what then shall I compare the people of this generation [who set aside God\u2019s plan]

 \u2018We played the flute for you [pretending to be at a wedding]
 and you did not dance; we sang a dirge [pretending to be at a funeral]
 and you did not weep [so nothing we did appealed to you].\u2019 ","For John the Baptist has come neither eating bread nor drinking wine
 and you say
 \u2018He has a demon!\u2019 ","The Son of Man has come eating and drinking
 and you say
 \u2018Look

 answering
 said to the Pharisee
 \u201cSimon

 \u201cDo you see this woman? I came into your house [but you failed to extend to Me the usual courtesies shown to a guest]; you gave Me no water for My feet

 she has not ceased to kiss My feet. ","You did not  anoint My head with  oil

 He spoke [to them] using a parable: ","\u201cThe sower went out to sow his seed; and as he sowed
 some fell beside the road and it was trampled underfoot
 and the birds of the sky ate it up. ","And some seed fell on [shallow soil covering] the rocks
 and as soon as it sprouted
 it withered away
 because it had no moisture. ","Other seed fell among the thorns
 and the thorns grew up with it and choked it out. ","And some fell into good soil
 and grew up and produced a crop a hundred times as great.\u201d As He said these things
 He called out
 \u201cHe who has ears to hear
 let him hear and heed My words.\u201d","And He said
 \u201cTo you [who have been chosen] it has been granted to know and recognize the mysteries of the kingdom of God
 but to the rest it is in parables
 so that though seeing they may not see
 and hearing they may not understand.","\u201cNow [the meaning of] the parable is this: The seed is the word of God [concerning eternal salvation].","Those beside the road are the people who have heard; then the devil comes and takes the message [of God] away from their hearts
 so that they will not believe [in Me as the Messiah] and be saved. ","Those on the rocky soil are the people who
 when they hear
 receive and welcome the word with joy; but these have no firmly grounded root. They believe for a while
 and in time of trial and temptation they fall away [from Me and abandon their faith]. ","The seed which fell among the thorns
 these are the ones who have heard
 but as they go on their way they are suffocated with the anxieties and riches and pleasures of this life
 and they bring no fruit to maturity. ","But as for that seed in the good soil
 these are the ones who have heard the word with a good and noble heart
 and hold on to it tightly
 and bear fruit with patience.","\u201cNow no one lights a lamp and then covers it with a container [to hide it]
 or puts it under a bed; instead
 he puts it on a lampstand
 so that those who come in may see the light. ","For there is nothing hidden that will not become evident
 nor anything secret that will not be known and come out into the open. ","So be careful how you listen; for whoever has [a teachable heart]
 to him more  will be given; and whoever does not have [a longing for truth]
 even what he thinks he has will be taken away from him.\u201d","And He was told
 \u201cYour mother and Your brothers are standing outside
 asking to see You.\u201d ","But He answered
 \u201cMy mother and My brothers are these who listen to the word of God and do it!\u201d","Now on one of those days Jesus and His disciples got into a boat
 and He said to them
 \u201cLet us cross over to the other side of the lake (Sea of Galilee).\u201d So they set out. ","And He said to them
 \u201cWhere is your faith [your confidence in Me]?\u201d They were afraid and astonished
 saying to one another
 \u201cWho then is this
 that He commands even the winds and the sea
 and they obey Him?\u201d","Then Jesus asked him
 \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d And he answered
 \u201cLegion\u201d; because many demons had entered him. ","\u201cReturn home and tell  all the great things God has done for you.\u201d So the man went away
 proclaiming throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him.","Jesus said
 \u201cWho touched Me?\u201d While they all were denying it
 Peter [and those who were with him] said
 \u201cMaster
 the people are crowding and pushing against You!\u201d ","But Jesus said
 \u201cSomeone did touch Me
 because I was aware that power [to heal] had gone out of Me.\u201d ","He said to her
 \u201cDaughter
 your faith [your personal trust and confidence in Me] has made you well. Go in peace (untroubled
 undisturbed well-being).\u201d","But Jesus
 hearing this
 answered him
 \u201cDo not be afraid any longer; only believe and trust [in Me and have faith in My ability to do this]
 and she will be made well.\u201d ","Now they were all weeping loudly and mourning for her; but He said
 \u201cDo not weep
 for she is not dead
 but is sleeping.\u201d ","But Jesus took hold of her hand and spoke
 saying
 \u201cChild
 arise!\u201d ","And He said to them
 \u201cTake nothing for your journey [that might encumber you]\u2014neither a walking stick
 nor bag
 nor bread
 nor money; and do not even have two tunics apiece. ","Whatever house you enter
 stay there until you leave that city [to go to another]. ","And as for all those who do not welcome you
 when you leave that city
 shake the dust off your feet [breaking all ties with them] as a testimony against them [that they rejected My message].\u201d ","But He said to them
 \u201cYou give them something to eat.\u201d They said
 \u201cWe have no more than five loaves and two fish\u2014unless perhaps we go and buy food for all these people.\u201d ","(For there were about 5
000 men.) And He said to His disciples
 \u201cHave them sit down to eat in groups of about fifty each.\u201d ","Now it happened that as Jesus was praying privately
 the disciples were with Him
 and He asked them
 \u201cWho do the crowds say that I am?\u201d ","And He said to them
 \u201cBut who do you say that I am?\u201d Peter replied
 \u201cThe Christ (the Messiah
 the Anointed) of God!\u201d ","saying
 \u201cThe Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected [as the Messiah] by the elders and chief priests and scribes (Sanhedrin
 Jewish High Court)
 and be put to death
 and on the third day be raised up [from death to life].\u201d","And He was saying to them all
 \u201cIf anyone wishes to follow Me [as My disciple]
 he must deny himself [set aside selfish interests]
 and take up his cross daily [expressing a willingness to endure whatever may come] and follow Me [believing in Me
 conforming to My example in living and
 if need be
 suffering or perhaps dying because of faith in Me]. ","For whoever wishes to save his life [in this world] will  lose it [through death]
 but whoever loses his life [in this world] for My sake
 he is the one who will save it [from the consequences of sin and separation from God]. ","For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world [wealth
 fame
 success]
 and loses or forfeits himself? ","For whoever is ashamed [here and now] of Me and My words
 the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when He comes in His glory and the glory of the  Father and of the holy angels. ","But I tell you truthfully
 there are some among those standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God.\u201d","And as these [men
 Moses and Elijah] were leaving Him
 Peter said to Jesus
 \u201cMaster
 it is delightful and good for us to be here; we should make three  tents; one for You
 one for Moses
 and one for Elijah\u201d\u2014not realizing what he was saying. ","Jesus answered
 \u201cYou unbelieving and perverted generation! How long shall I be with you and put up with you? Bring your son here [to Me].\u201d ","\u201cLet these words sink into your ears: the Son of Man is going to be betrayed and handed over to men [who are His enemies].\u201d","and He told them
 \u201cWhoever welcomes this child in My name welcomes Me; and whoever welcomes Me  welcomes Him who sent Me; for the one who is least among all of you [that is
 the one who is genuinely humble\u2014the one with a realistic self-view]\u2014he is the one who is  great.\u201d","But Jesus told him
 \u201cDo not stop him; for he who is not against you is for you.\u201d","And Jesus told him
 \u201cFoxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests
 but the Son of Man has no place to lay His head.\u201d ","He said to another
 \u201cFollow Me [accepting Me as Master and Teacher].\u201d But he said
 \u201cLord
 allow me first to go and bury my father.\u201d ","But He said to him
 \u201cAllow the  dead to bury their own dead; but as for you
 go and spread the news about the kingdom of God.\u201d ","But Jesus said to him
 \u201cNo one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back [to the things left behind] is fit for the kingdom of God.\u201d","He was saying to them
 \u201cThe harvest is abundant [for there are many who need to hear the good news about salvation]
 but the workers [those available to proclaim the message of salvation] are few. Therefore
  ask the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into His harvest. ","Go your way; listen carefully: I am sending you out like lambs among wolves.","Do not carry a money belt
 a provision bag
 or  sandals; and do not greet anyone along the way [who would delay you]. ","Whatever house you enter
 first say
 \u2018Peace [that is
 a blessing of well-being and prosperity
 the favor of God] to this house.\u2019 ","And if anyone of peace is there [someone who is sweet-spirited and hospitable]
 your [blessing of] peace will rest on him; but if not
 it will return to you. ","Stay in that house
 eating and drinking what they provide
 for the laborer is worthy of his wages. Do not move from house to house. ","Whenever you go into a city and they welcome you
 eat what is set before you; ","and heal those in it who are sick [authenticating your message]
 and say to them
 \u2018The kingdom of God has come near to you.\u2019 ","But whatever city you enter and they do not welcome you
 go out into its streets and say
 ","\u2018Even the dust of your city which clings to our feet we wipe off in protest against you [breaking all ties]; yet understand this
 that the kingdom of God has come near [and you rejected it].\u2019 ","I tell you
 it will be more bearable in that day [of judgment] for Sodom than for that city.","\u201cWoe (judgment is coming) to you
 Chorazin! Woe to you
 Bethsaida! For if the miracles performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon
 they would have repented and changed their minds long ago
 sitting in sackcloth and ashes [to show deep regret for sin]. ","However
 it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you. ","And you
 Capernaum
 will not be exalted to heaven
 will you? You will descend to Hades (the realm of the dead).","\u201cThe one who listens to you listens to Me; and the one who rejects you rejects Me; and the one who rejects Me rejects Him [My heavenly Father] who sent Me.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cI watched Satan fall from heaven like [a flash of] lightning. ","Listen carefully: I have given you authority [that you now possess] to tread on serpents and scorpions
 and [the ability to exercise authority] over all the power of the enemy (Satan); and nothing will [in any way] harm you. ","Nevertheless do not rejoice at this
 that the spirits are subject to you
 but rejoice that your names are recorded in heaven.\u201d","In that very hour He was overjoyed and rejoiced greatly in the Holy Spirit
 and He said
 \u201cI praise You
 O Father
 Lord of heaven and earth
 that You have hidden these things [relating to salvation] from the wise and intelligent
 and have revealed them to infants [the childlike and untaught]. Yes
 Father
 for this way was [Your gracious will and choice
 and was] well-pleasing in Your sight. ","All things have been transferred and turned over to Me by My Father and no one knows who the Son is except the Father
 or who the Father is except the Son
 and anyone to whom the Son wishes to reveal Him.\u201d","Then turning to His disciples
 Jesus said privately
 \u201cBlessed [joyful
 spiritually enlightened
 and favored by God] are the eyes which see what you see
 ","for I say to you that many prophets and kings longed to see what you see
 and they did not see it; and to hear what you hear
 and did not hear it.\u201d","And a certain lawyer [an expert in Mosaic Law] stood up to test Him
 saying
 \u201cTeacher
 what must I do to inherit eternal life?\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cWhat is written in the Law? How do you read it?\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cYou have answered correctly; do this habitually and you will live.\u201d ","Jesus replied
 \u201cA man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho
 and he encountered robbers
 who stripped him of his clothes [and belongings]
 beat him
 and went their way 
 leaving him half dead. ","Now by coincidence a priest was going down that road
 and when he saw him
 he passed by on the other side. ","Likewise a Levite also came down to the place and saw him
 and passed by on the other side [of the road]. ","But a Samaritan (foreigner)
 who was traveling
 came upon him; and when he saw him
 he was deeply moved with compassion [for him]
 ","and went to him and bandaged up his wounds
 pouring oil and wine on them [to sooth and disinfect the injuries]; and he put him on his own pack-animal
 and brought him to an inn and took care of him. ","On the next day he took out two denarii (two days\u2019 wages) and gave them to the innkeeper
 and said
 \u2018Take care of him; and whatever more you spend
 I will repay you when I return.\u2019 ","Which of these three do you think proved himself a neighbor to the man who encountered the robbers?\u201d","He answered
 \u201cThe one who showed compassion and mercy to him.\u201d Then Jesus said to him
 \u201cGo and constantly do the same.\u201d","But the Lord replied to her
 \u201cMartha
 Martha
 you are worried and bothered and anxious about so many things; ","but only one thing is necessary
 for Mary has chosen the good part [that which is to her advantage]
 which will not be taken away from her.\u201d","It happened that while Jesus was praying in a certain place
 after He finished
 one of His disciples said to Him
 \u201cLord
 teach us to pray just as John also taught his disciples.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cWhen you pray
 say: \u2018Father
 hallowed be Your name. Your kingdom come.","\u2018Give us each day our daily bread."," \u2018And forgive us our sins
 For we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us [who has offended or wronged us]. And lead us not into temptation [but rescue us from evil].\u2019\u201d","Then He said to them
 \u201cSuppose one of you has a friend
 and goes to him at midnight and says
 \u2018Friend
 lend me three loaves [of bread]; ","for a friend of mine who is on a journey has just come to visit me
 and I have nothing to serve him\u2019; ","and from inside he answers
 \u2018Do not bother me; the door has already been shut and my children and I are in bed; I cannot get up and give you anything.\u2019 ","I tell you
 even though he will not get up and give him anything just because he is his friend
 yet because of his persistence and boldness he will get up and give him whatever he needs.","\u201cSo I say to you
 ask and keep on asking
 and it will be given to you; seek and keep on seeking
 and you will find; knock and keep on knocking
 and the door will be opened to you. ","For everyone who keeps on asking 
 receives; and he who keeps on seeking 
 finds; and to him who keeps on knocking 
 the door will be opened. ","What father among you
 if his son asks for a fish
 will give him a snake instead of a fish? ","Or if he asks for an egg
 will give him a scorpion? ","If you
 then
 being evil [that is
 sinful by nature]
 know how to give good gifts to your children
 how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask and continue to ask Him!\u201d","And [at another time] Jesus was casting out a demon
 and it was [controlling a man so as to make him] mute; when the demon had gone out
 the mute man spoke. And the crowds were awed. ","But He
 well aware of their thoughts and purpose
 said to them
 \u201cEvery kingdom divided against itself is doomed to destruction; and a house divided against itself falls. ","If Satan also is divided against himself
 how will his kingdom stand and continue to survive? For you are saying that I drive out demons by [the power of] Beelzebul. ","Now if I drive out the demons by Beelzebul
 by whom do your sons [the Jewish exorcists] drive them out? For this reason they will be your judges. ","But if I drive out the demons by the finger of God
 then the kingdom of God has already come upon you. ","When the strong man
 fully armed
 guards his own house
 his belongings are undisturbed and secure. ","But when someone stronger than he attacks and overpowers him
 he robs him of all his armor on which he had relied and divides his [goods as] spoil. ","He who is not with Me [believing in Me as Lord and Savior] is against Me [there is no impartial position]; and he who does not gather with Me [assisting in My ministry]
 scatters.","\u201cWhen the unclean spirit comes out of a person
 it roams through waterless places in search [of a place] of rest; and not finding any
 it says
 \u2018I will go back to my house (person) from which I came.\u2019 ","And when it comes
 it finds the place swept and put in order. ","Then it goes and brings seven other spirits more evil than itself
 and they go in [the person] and live there; and the last state of that person becomes worse than the first.\u201d","Now while Jesus was saying these things
 one of the women in the crowd raised her voice and said to Him
 \u201cBlessed (happy
 favored by God) is the womb that gave birth to You and the breasts at which You nursed!\u201d ","But He said
 \u201cOn the contrary
 blessed (happy
 favored by God) are those who hear the word of God and continually observe it.\u201d","Now as the crowds were increasing [in number]
 He began to say
 \u201cThis  generation is a wicked generation; it seeks a sign (attesting miracle)
 but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah [the prophet]. ","For just as Jonah became a sign to the people of Nineveh
 so will the Son of Man also be [a sign] to this generation. ","The Queen of the South (the kingdom of Sheba) will rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them
 because she came from the ends of the earth to listen to the wisdom of Solomon
 and look
 something greater than Solomon is here. ","The men of Nineveh will stand up [as witnesses] at the judgment with this generation and condemn it
 because they repented at the preaching of Jonah
 and look
 something greater than Jonah is here.","\u201cNo one lights a lamp and then puts it in a cellar nor under a basket [hiding the light]
 but [instead it is put] on the lampstand
 so that those who come in may see the light. ","The eye is the lamp of your body. When your eye is clear [spiritually perceptive
 focused on God]
 your whole body also is full of light [benefiting from God\u2019s precepts]. But when it is bad [spiritually blind]
 your body also is full of darkness [devoid of God\u2019s word]. ","Be careful
 therefore
 that the light that is in you is not darkness. ","So if your whole body is illuminated
 with no dark part
 it will be entirely bright [with light]
 as when the lamp gives you light with its bright rays.\u201d","But the Lord said to him
 \u201cNow you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and plate [as required by tradition]; but inside you are full of greed and wickedness. ","You foolish ones [acting without reflection or intelligence]! Did not He who made the outside make the inside also?","But give that which is within as charity [that is
 acts of mercy and compassion
 not as a public display
 but as an expression of your faithfulness to God]
 and then indeed all things are clean for you.","\u201cBut woe (judgment is coming) to you Pharisees
 because you [self-righteously] tithe mint and rue and every  garden herb [tending to all the minutiae]
 and yet disregard and neglect justice and the love of God; but these are the things you should have done
 without neglecting the others. ","Woe to you Pharisees
 because you love the best seats in the synagogues and to be respectfully greeted in the market places. ","Woe to you! For you are like graves which are unmarked
 and people walk over them without being aware of it [and are ceremonially unclean].\u201d","But He said
 \u201cWoe to you lawyers as well
 because you weigh men down with burdens [man-made rules
 unreasonable requirements] which are hard to bear
 and you yourselves will not even touch the burdens with one of your fingers [to lighten the load]. ","Woe to you! For you repair or build tombs for the prophets
 and it was your fathers who killed them. ","So you are witnesses and approve the deeds of your fathers
 because they  killed them
 and you repair or build their tombs. ","For this reason also the wisdom of God said [in the Scriptures]
 \u2018I will send them prophets and apostles
 some of whom they will put to death and some they will persecute
 ","so that charges may be brought against this generation [holding them responsible] for the blood of all the prophets shed since the foundation of the world
 ","from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah [the priest]
 who was murdered between the altar and the house of God. Yes
 I tell you
 charges will be brought against this generation.\u2019 ","Woe to you lawyers
 because you have taken away the key to knowledge (scriptural truth). You yourselves did not enter
 and you held back those who were entering [by your flawed interpretation of God\u2019s word and your man-made tradition].\u201d","In the meantime
 after so many thousands of the people had gathered that they were stepping on one another
 Jesus began speaking first of all to His disciples
 \u201cBe continually on your guard against the leaven of the Pharisees [that is
 their pervasive
 corrupting influence and teaching]
 which is hypocrisy [producing self-righteousness]. ","But there is nothing [so carefully] concealed that it will not be revealed
 nor so hidden that it will not be made known. ","For that reason
 whatever you have said in the dark will be heard in the light
 and what you have whispered behind closed doors will be proclaimed on the housetops.","\u201cI say to you
 My friends
 do not be afraid of those who kill the body and after that have nothing more that they can do. ","But I will point out to you whom you should fear: fear the One who
 after He has killed
 has authority and power to hurl  into hell; yes
 I say to you
 [stand in great awe of God and] fear Him! ","Are not five sparrows sold for two copper coins? Yet not one of them has  been forgotten in the presence of God.","Indeed the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Do not be afraid; you are far more valuable than many sparrows.","\u201cI say to you
 whoever declares openly and confesses Me before men [speaking freely of Me as his Lord]
 the Son of Man also will declare openly and confess him [as one of His own] before the angels of God. ","But he who denies Me before men will be denied in the presence of the angels of God.","And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man
 it will be forgiven him; but he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit [that is
 whoever intentionally discredits the Holy Spirit by attributing the authenticating miracles done by Me to Satan]
 it will not be forgiven him [for him there is no forgiveness]. ","When they bring you before the synagogues and the magistrates and the authorities
 do not be worried about how you are to defend yourselves or what you are to say; ","for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour what you ought to say.\u201d","But He said to him
 \u201cMan
 who appointed Me a judge or an arbitrator over [the two of] you?\u201d ","Then He said to them
 \u201cWatch out and guard yourselves against every form of greed; for not even when one has an overflowing abundance does his life consist of nor is it derived from his possessions.\u201d","Then He told them a parable
 saying
 \u201cThere was a rich man whose land was very fertile and productive. ","And he began thinking to himself
 \u2018What shall I do
 since I have no place [large enough in which] to store my crops?\u2019 ","Then he said
 \u2018This is what I will do: I will tear down my storehouses and build larger ones
 and I will store all my grain and my goods there. ","And I will say to my soul
 \u201cSoul
 you have many good things stored up
  for many years; rest and relax
 eat
 drink and be merry (celebrate continually).\u201d\u2019 ","But God said to him
 \u2018You fool! This very night your soul is required of you; and now who will own all the things you have prepared?\u2019 ","So it is for the one who continues to store up and hoard possessions for himself
 and is not rich [in his relationship] toward God.\u201d","Jesus said to His disciples
 \u201cFor this reason I tell you
 do not worry about your life
 as to what you will eat; or about your body
 as to what you will wear. ","For life is more than food
 and the body more than clothes. ","Consider the ravens
 for they neither sow  nor reap [the crop]; they have no storehouse or barn
 and yet God feeds them. How much more valuable are you than the birds! ","And which of you by worrying can add one hour to his life\u2019s span?","So if you are not even able to do a very little thing [such as that]
 why are you worried about the rest? ","Consider the lilies and wildflowers
 how they grow [in the open field]. They neither labor nor spin [wool to make clothing]; yet I tell you
 not even Solomon in all his glory and splendor dressed himself like one of these. ","But if this is how God clothes the grass which is in the field today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace
 how much more will He clothe you? You of little faith! ","So as for you
 do not seek what you will eat and what you will drink; nor have an anxious and unsettled mind. ","For all the  nations of the world greedily seek these things; and your  Father  knows that you need them.","But [strive for and actively] seek His kingdom
 and these things will be given to you as well. ","Do not be afraid and anxious
 little flock
 for it is your Father\u2019s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.","\u201cSell your possessions (show compassion) and give  to the poor. Provide money belts for yourselves that do not wear out
 an unfailing and inexhaustible treasure in the heavens
 where no thief comes near and no moth destroys. ","For where your treasure is
 there your heart will be also.","\u201cBe dressed and ready for active service
 and keep your lamps continuously burning. ","Be like men who are waiting for their master when he returns from the wedding feast
 so that when he comes and knocks they may immediately open the door for him. ","Blessed (happy
 prosperous
 to be admired) are those servants whom the master finds awake and watching when he arrives. I assure you and most solemnly say to you
 he will prepare himself to serve
 and will have them recline at the table
 and will come and wait on them. ","Whether he comes in the second watch (before midnight)
 or even in the third (after midnight)
 and finds them so [prepared and ready]
 blessed are those servants.","\u201cBut be sure of this
 that if the head of the house had known at what time the thief was coming
 he [would have been awake and alert
 and] would not have allowed his house to be broken into. ","You too
 be continually ready; because the Son of Man is coming at an hour that you do not expect.\u201d","The Lord said
 \u201cWho then is the faithful and wise steward [of the estate]

 to give his servants their portion of food at the proper time? ","Blessed (happy
 prosperous

 he will put him in charge of all his possessions. ","But if that servant says in his heart
 \u2018My master is taking his time in coming
\u2019 and begins to beat the servants
 both men and women
 and to eat and drink and get drunk
 ","the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know
 and will cut him in pieces
 and assign him a place with the unbelievers. ","And that servant who knew his master\u2019s will
 and yet did not get ready or act in accord with his will
 will be beaten with many lashes [of the whip]
 ","but the one who did not know it and did things worthy of a beating
 will receive only a few . From everyone to whom much has been given
 much will be required; and to whom they entrusted much
 of him they will ask all the more.","\u201cI have come to cast fire (judgment) on the earth; and how I wish that it were already kindled!","I have a baptism [of great suffering] with which to be baptized
 and how  I am distressed until it is accomplished! ","Do you suppose that I came to grant peace on earth? No
 I tell you
 but rather division [between believers and unbelievers]; ","for from now on five in one household will be divided [over Me]
 three against two and two against three. ","They will be divided
 father against son and son against father
 mother against daughter and daughter against mother
 mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.\u201d","He also said to the crowds
 \u201cWhen you see a cloud rising in the west

 you  will not get out of there until you have paid the very last cent.\u201d","Jesus replied to them
 \u201cDo you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all other Galileans because they have suffered in this way? ","I tell you
 no; but unless you repent [change your old way of thinking
 turn from your sinful ways and live changed lives]
 you will all likewise perish. ","Or do you assume that those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed were worse sinners than all the others who live in Jerusalem?","I tell you
 no; but unless you repent [change your old way of thinking
 turn from your sinful ways and live changed lives]
 you will all likewise perish.\u201d","Then He began telling them this parable: \u201cA certain man had a fig tree that had been planted in his vineyard; and he came looking for fruit on it
 but did not find any; ","so he said to the vineyard-keeper
 \u2018For three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree and have found none. Cut it down! Why does it even use up the ground [depleting the soil and blocking the sunlight]?\u2019 ","But he replied to him
 \u2018Let it alone
 sir
  one more year until I dig around it and put in fertilizer; ","and if it bears fruit after this
 fine; but if not
 cut it down.\u2019\u201d","When Jesus saw her
 He called her over and said to her
 \u201cWoman
 you are released from your illness.\u201d ","But the Lord replied to him
 \u201cYou hypocrites (play-actors
 pretenders)! Does not each one of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from the stall and lead it away to water it? ","And this woman
 a daughter (descendant) of Abraham whom Satan has bound for eighteen long years
 should she not have been released from this bond on the Sabbath day?\u201d ","So this led Him to say
 \u201cWhat is the kingdom of God like? And to what shall I compare it? ","It is like a mustard seed
 which a man took and planted in his own garden; and it grew and became a tree
 and the birds of the sky found shelter and nested in its branches.\u201d","And again He said
 \u201cTo what shall I compare the kingdom of God? ","It is like leaven
 which a woman took and hid in three peck measures of flour until it was all leavened.\u201d","And someone asked Him
 \u201cLord
 will only a few be saved [from the penalties of the last judgment]?\u201d And He said to them
 ","\u201cStrive to enter through the narrow door [force aside unbelief and the attractions of sin]; for many
 I tell you
 will try to enter [by their own works] and will not be able. ","Once the head of the house gets up and closes the door
 and you begin to stand outside and knock on the door [again and again]
 saying
 \u2018Lord
 open to us!\u2019 then He will answer you
 \u2018I do not know where you are from [for you are not of My household].\u2019 ","Then you will begin to say
 \u2018We ate and drank in Your presence
 and You taught in our streets\u2019; ","but He will say to you
 \u2018I do not know where you are from; depart from Me
 all you evildoers!\u2019 ","In that place there will be weeping [in sorrow and pain] and grinding of teeth [in distress and anger] when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God
 but yourselves being thrown out and driven away. ","And people will come from east and west
 and from north and south
 and they will sit down [and feast at the table] in the kingdom of God. ","And behold
 some are last who will be first
 and some are first who will be last.\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cGo and tell that fox [that sly
 cowardly man]
 \u2018Listen carefully: I cast out demons and perform healings today and tomorrow
 and on the third day I reach My goal.\u2019 ","Nevertheless I must travel on today and tomorrow and the day after that\u2014for it cannot be that a prophet would die outside of Jerusalem.","O Jerusalem
 Jerusalem
 who kills the prophets and stones [to death] those  who are sent to her [by God]! How often I have wanted to gather your children together [around Me]
 just as a hen gathers her young under her wings
 but you were not willing! ","Listen carefully: your house is left to you desolate [abandoned by God and destitute of His protection]; and I say to you
 you will not see Me until the time comes when you say
 \u2018Blessed [to be celebrated with praise] is He who comes in the name of the Lord!\u2019\u201d","And Jesus asked the lawyers and the Pharisees
 \u201cIs it lawful to heal on the Sabbath
 or not?\u201d ","Then He said to them
 \u201cWhich one of you
 having a son or an ox that falls into a well
 will not immediately pull him out on the Sabbath day?\u201d ","\u201cWhen you are invited by someone to a wedding feast
 do not sit down [to eat] at the place of honor
 since a more distinguished person than you may have been invited by the host
 ","and he who invited both of you will come and say to you
 \u2018Give this man your place
\u2019 and then
 in disgrace you proceed to take the last place. ","But when you are invited
 go and sit down [to eat] at the last place
 so that when your host comes
 he will say to you
 \u2018Friend
 move up higher\u2019; and then you will be honored in the presence of all who are at the table with you. ","For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled [before others]
 and he who habitually humbles himself (keeps a realistic self-view) will be exalted.\u201d","Jesus also went on to say to the one who had invited Him
 \u201cWhen you give a luncheon or a dinner
 do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or wealthy neighbors
 otherwise they may also invite you in return and that will be your repayment. ","But when you give a banquet or a reception
 invite the poor
 the disabled
 the lame
 and the blind
 ","and you will be blessed because they cannot repay you; for you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous (the just
 the upright).\u201d","When one of those who were reclining at the table with Him heard this
 he said to Him
 \u201cBlessed (happy
 prosperous
 to be admired) is he who will eat bread in the kingdom of God!\u201d","But Jesus said to him
 \u201cA man was giving a big dinner
 and he invited many guests; ","and at the dinner hour he sent his servant to tell those who had been invited
 \u2018Come
 because everything is ready now.\u2019 ","But they all alike began to make excuses. The first one said to him
 \u2018I have purchased a piece of land and I have to go out and see it; please consider me excused.\u2019 ","Another one said
 \u2018I have purchased five yoke of oxen
 and I am going to try them out; please consider me excused.\u2019 ","And another said
 \u2018I have  married a wife
 and for that reason I am unable to come.\u2019 ","So the servant came back and reported this to his master. Then [his master
] the head of the household
 became angry [at the rejections of his invitation] and said to his servant
 \u2018Go out quickly into the streets and the lanes of the city and bring in here the poor and the disabled and the blind and the lame.\u2019 ","And the servant [after returning] said
 \u2018Sir
 what you commanded has been done
 and still there is room.\u2019 ","Then the master told the servant
 \u2018Go out into the highways and along the hedges
 and compel them to come in
 so that my house may be filled [with guests]. ","For I tell you
 not one of those who were invited [and declined] will taste my dinner.\u2019\u201d","Now large crowds were going along with Jesus; and He turned and said to them
 ","\u201cIf anyone comes to Me
 and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters
 yes
 and even his own life [in the sense of indifference to or relative disregard for them in comparison with his attitude toward God]\u2014he cannot be My disciple. ","Whoever does not carry his own cross [expressing a willingness to endure whatever may come] and follow after Me [believing in Me
 conforming to My example in living and
 if need be
 suffering or perhaps dying because of faith in Me] cannot be My disciple. ","For which one of you
 when he wants to build a watchtower [for his guards]
 does not first sit down and calculate the cost
 to see if he has enough to finish it? ","Otherwise
 when he has laid a foundation and is unable to finish [the building]
 all who see it will begin to ridicule him
 ","saying
 \u2018This man began to build and was not able to finish!\u2019 ","Or what king
 when he sets out to meet another king in battle
 will not first sit down and consider whether he is strong enough with ten thousand men to encounter the one who is coming against him with twenty thousand? ","Or else [if he feels he is not powerful enough]
 while the other  is still a far distance away
 he sends an envoy and asks for terms of peace. ","So then
 none of you can be My disciple who does not [carefully consider the cost and then for My sake] give up all his own possessions.","\u201cTherefore
 salt is good; but if salt has become tasteless
 with what will it be seasoned? ","It is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile; it is thrown away. He who has ears to hear
 let him hear and heed My words.\u201d","\u201cWhat man among you
 if he has a hundred sheep and loses one of them
 does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go after the one which is lost
  until he finds it? ","And when he has found it
 he lays it on his shoulders
 rejoicing. ","And when he gets home
 he calls together his friends and his neighbors
 saying to them
 \u2018Rejoice with me
 because I have found my lost sheep!\u2019 ","I tell you
 in the same way there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous people who have no need of repentance.","\u201cOr what woman
 if she has ten silver coins [each one equal to a day\u2019s wages] and loses one coin
 does not light a lamp and sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it? ","And when she has found it
 she calls together her  friends and neighbors
 saying
 \u2018Rejoice with me
 because I found the lost coin!\u2019 ","In the same way
 I tell you
 there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents [that is
 changes his inner self\u2014his old way of thinking
 regrets past sins
 lives his life in a way that proves repentance; and seeks God\u2019s purpose for his life].\u201d","Then He said
 \u201cA certain man had two sons. ","The younger of them  said to his father
 \u2018Father
 give me the share of the property that falls to me.\u2019 So he divided the estate between them. ","A few days later
 the younger son gathered together everything [that he had] and traveled to a distant country
 and there he wasted his fortune in reckless and immoral living. ","Now when he had spent everything
 a severe famine occurred in that country
 and he began to do without and be in need. ","So he went and forced himself on one of the citizens of that country
 who sent him into his fields to feed pigs. ","He would have gladly eaten the  pods that the pigs were eating [but they could not satisfy his hunger]
 and no one was giving anything to him. ","But when he  came to his senses
 he said
 \u2018How many of my father\u2019s hired men have more than enough food
 while I am dying here of hunger! ","I will get up and go to my father
 and I will say to him
 \u201cFather
 I have sinned against heaven and in your sight. ","I am no longer worthy to be called your son;  treat me like one of your hired men.\u201d\u2019","So he got up and came to his father. But while he was still a long way off
 his father saw him and was moved with compassion for him
 and ran and embraced him and kissed him. ","And the son said to him
 \u2018Father
 I have sinned against heaven and in your sight; I am no longer worthy to be called your son.\u2019 ","But the father said to his servants
 \u2018Quickly bring out the best robe [for the guest of honor] and put it on him; and give him a ring for his hand
 and sandals for his feet. ","And bring the fattened calf and slaughter it
 and let us [invite everyone and] feast and celebrate; ","for this son of mine was [as good as] dead and is alive again; he was lost and has been found.\u2019 So they began to celebrate.","\u201cNow his older son was in the field; and when he returned and approached the house
 he heard music and dancing. ","So he summoned one of the servants and began asking what this  meant.","And he said to him
 \u2018Your brother has come
 and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has received him back safe and sound.\u2019 ","But the elder brother became angry and deeply resentful and was not willing to go in; and his father came out and began pleading with him.","But he said to his father
 \u2018Look! These many years I have served you
 and I have never neglected or disobeyed your command. Yet you have never given me [so much as] a young goat
 so that I might celebrate with my friends; ","but when this  son of yours arrived
 who has devoured your estate with immoral women
 you slaughtered that fattened calf for him!\u2019 ","The father said to him
 \u2018Son
 you are always with me
 and all that is mine is yours. ","But it was fitting to celebrate and rejoice
 for this brother of yours was [as good as] dead and has begun to live. He was lost and has been found.\u2019\u201d","Now Jesus was also saying to the disciples
 \u201cThere was a certain rich man who had a manager [of his estate]
 and accusations [against this man] were brought to him
 that this man was squandering his [master\u2019s] possessions. ","So he called him and said to him
 \u2018What is this I hear about you? Give an accounting of your management [of my affairs]
 for you can no longer be  manager.\u2019 ","The manager [of the estate] said to himself
 \u2018What will I do
 since my master is taking the management away from me? I am not strong enough to dig [for a living]
 and I am ashamed to beg. ","I know what I will do
 so that when I am removed from the management
 people [who are my master\u2019s debtors] will welcome me into their homes.\u2019 ","So he summoned his master\u2019s debtors one by one
 and he said to the first
 \u2018How much do you owe my master?\u2019 ","He said
 \u2018A hundred measures of  oil.\u2019 And he said to him
 \u2018Take your bill
 and sit down quickly and write fifty.\u2019 ","Then he said to another
 \u2018And how much do you owe?\u2019 He said
 \u2018A hundred measures of wheat.\u2019 He said to him
 \u2018Take your bill
 and write eighty.\u2019 ","And his master commended the unjust manager [not for his misdeeds
 but] because he had acted shrewdly [by preparing for his future unemployment]; for the sons of this age [the non-believers] are shrewder in relation to their own kind [that is
 to the ways of the secular world] than are the sons of light [the believers]. ","And I tell you [learn from this]
 make friends for yourselves [for eternity] by means of the wealth of unrighteousness [that is
 use material resources as a way to further the work of God]
 so that when it runs out
 they will welcome you into the eternal dwellings.","\u201cHe who is faithful in a very little thing is also faithful in much; and he who is dishonest in a very little thing is also dishonest in much.","Therefore if you have not been faithful in the use of earthly wealth
 who will entrust the true riches to you? ","And if you have not been faithful in the use of that [earthly wealth] which belongs to another [whether God or man
 and of which you are a trustee]
 who will give you that which is your own? ","No servant can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other
 or he will stand devotedly by the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and mammon [that is
 your earthly possessions or anything else you trust in and rely on instead of God].\u201d","So He said to them
 \u201cYou are the ones who declare yourselves just and upright in the sight of men
 but God knows your hearts [your thoughts
 your desires
 your secrets]; for that which is highly esteemed among men is detestable in the sight of God.","\u201cThe Law and the [writings of the] Prophets were proclaimed until John; since then the gospel of the kingdom of God has been and continues to be preached
 and everyone tries forcefully to go into it. ","Yet it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for a single stroke of a letter of the Law to fail and become void.","\u201cWhoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery
 and he who marries one who is divorced from her husband commits adultery.","\u201cNow there was a certain rich man who was habitually dressed in expensive purple and fine linen
 and celebrated and lived joyously in splendor every day. ","And a poor man named Lazarus
 was laid at his gate
 covered with sores. ","He  longed to eat the crumbs which fell from the rich man\u2019s table. Besides
 even the dogs were coming and licking his sores. ","Now it happened that the poor man died and his spirit was carried away by the angels to Abraham\u2019s bosom (paradise); and the rich man also died and was buried.","In Hades (the realm of the dead)
 being in torment
 he looked up and saw Abraham far away and Lazarus in his bosom (paradise). ","And he cried out
 \u2018Father Abraham
 have mercy on me
 and send Lazarus so that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue
 because I am in severe agony in this flame.\u2019 ","But Abraham said
 \u2018Son
 remember that in your lifetime you received your good things [all the comforts and delights]
 and Lazarus likewise bad things [all the discomforts and distresses]; but now he is comforted here [in paradise]
 while you are in severe agony. ","And besides all this
 between us and you  a great chasm has been fixed
 so that those who want to come over from here to you will not be able
 and none may cross over from there to us.\u2019 ","So the rich man said
 \u2018Then
 father 
 I beg you to send Lazarus to my father\u2019s house\u2014 ","for I have five brothers\u2014in order that he may solemnly warn them and witness to them
 so that they too will not come to this place of torment.\u2019 ","But Abraham said
 \u2018They have [the Scriptures given by] Moses and the [writings of the] Prophets; let them listen to them.\u2019 ","He replied
 \u2018No
 father Abraham
 but if someone from the dead goes to them
 they will repent [they will change their old way of thinking and seek God and His righteousness].\u2019 ","And he said to him
 \u2018If they do not listen to [the messages of] Moses and the Prophets
 they will not be persuaded even if someone rises from the dead.\u2019\u201d","Jesus said to His disciples
 \u201cStumbling blocks [temptations and traps set to lure one to sin] are sure to come
 but woe (judgment is coming) to him through whom they come! ","It would be better for him if a millstone [as large as one turned by a donkey] were hung around his neck and he were hurled into the sea
 than for him to cause one of these little ones to stumble [in sin and lose faith]. ","Pay attention and always be on guard [looking out for one another]! If your brother sins and disregards God\u2019s precepts
 solemnly warn him; and if he repents and changes
 forgive him. ","Even if he sins against you seven times a day
 and returns to you seven times and says
 \u2018I repent
\u2019 you must forgive him [that is
 give up resentment and consider the offense recalled and annulled].\u201d","And the Lord said
 \u201cIf you have [confident
 abiding] faith in God [even as small] as a mustard seed
 you could say to this mulberry tree [which has very strong roots]
 \u2018Be pulled up by the roots and be planted in the sea\u2019; and [if the request was in agreement with the will of God] it would have obeyed you.","\u201cWhich of you who has a servant plowing or tending sheep will say to him when he comes in from the field
 \u2018Come at once and sit down to eat?\u2019 ","Will he not instead say to him
 \u2018Prepare something for me to eat
 and appropriately clothe yourself [for service] and serve me while I eat and drink; then afterward you may eat and drink?\u2019 ","He does not thank the servant just because he did what he was ordered to do
 does he? ","So you too
 when you have done everything that was assigned and commanded you
 say
 \u2018We are unworthy servants [undeserving of praise or a reward
 for we have not gone beyond our obligation]; we have merely done what we ought to do.\u2019\u201d","While Jesus was on the way to Jerusalem
 He was passing [along the border] between Samaria and Galilee. ","When He saw them
 He said to them
 \u201cGo and show yourselves to the priests.\u201d And as they went
 they were  healed and made clean. ","Then Jesus asked
 \u201cWere not ten [of you] cleansed? Where are the  nine? ","Was there no one found to return and to give thanks and praise to God
 except this foreigner?\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cGet up and go [on your way]. Your faith [your personal trust in Me and your confidence in God\u2019s power] has restored you to health.\u201d","Now having been asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come
 He replied
 \u201cThe kingdom of God is not coming with signs to be observed or with a visible display; ","nor will people say
 \u2018Look! Here it is!\u2019 or
 \u2018There it is!\u2019 For the kingdom of God is among you [because of My presence].\u201d","Then He said to the disciples
 \u201cThe time will come when you will long to see  one of the days of the Son of Man
 and you will not see it. ","They will say to you
 \u2018Look [the Messiah is] there!\u2019 or \u2018Look [He is] here!\u2019 Do not go away [to see Him]
 and do not run after them. ","For just like the lightning
 when it flashes out of one part of the sky
 gives light to the other part of the sky
 so  will the Son of Man be in His day. ","But first He must suffer many things and be repudiated and rejected and considered unfit [to be the Messiah] by this  generation.","And just as it was in the days of Noah
 so it will be in the time of [the second coming of] the Son of Man: ","the people were eating
 they were drinking
 they were marrying
 they were being given in marriage
 [they were indifferent to God] until the day that Noah went into the ark
 and the flood came and destroyed them all. ","It was the same as it was in the days of Lot. People were eating
 they were drinking
 they were buying
 they were selling
 they were planting
 they were building [carrying on business as usual
 without regard for their sins]; ","but on the  day that Lot left Sodom it rained fire and brimstone (burning sulfur) from heaven and destroyed them all.","It will be just the same on the day that the Son of Man is revealed.","On that day
 whoever is on the housetop
 with his belongings in the house
 must not come down [and go inside] to take them out; and likewise whoever is in the field must not turn back. ","Remember [what happened to] Lot\u2019s wife [when she looked back]!","Whoever seeks to save his life will  lose it [through death]
 and whoever loses his life [in this world] will keep it [from the consequences of sin and separation from God]. ","I tell you
 on that night [when Messiah comes again] there will be two  in one bed; the one (the non-believer) will be taken [away in judgment] and the other (the believer) will be left. ","There will be two women grinding [at the mill] together; the one (the non-believer) will be taken [away in judgment] and the other (the believer) will be left.","And they asked Him
 \u201cWhere
 Lord?\u201d He answered
 \u201cWhere the corpse is
 there the vultures will be gathered.\u201d","saying
 \u201cIn a certain city there was a judge who did not fear God and had no respect for man. ","There was a  widow in that city and she kept coming to him and saying
 \u2018Give me justice and legal protection from my adversary.\u2019 ","For a time he would not; but later he said to himself
 \u2018Even though I do not fear God nor respect man
 ","yet because this widow continues to bother me
 I will give her justice and legal protection; otherwise by continually coming she [will be an intolerable annoyance and she] will wear me out.\u2019\u201d ","Then the Lord said
 \u201cListen to what the unjust judge says! ","And will not [our just] God defend and avenge His elect [His chosen ones] who cry out to Him day and night? Will He delay [in providing justice] on their behalf?","I tell you that He will defend and avenge them quickly. However
 when the Son of Man comes
 will He find [this kind of persistent] faith on the earth?\u201d","\u201cTwo men went up into the temple  to pray
 one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. ","The Pharisee stood  and began praying to himself [in a self-righteous way
 saying]: \u2018God
 I thank You that I am not like the rest of men\u2014swindlers
 unjust (dishonest)
 adulterers\u2014or even like this tax collector. ","I fast twice a week; I pay tithes of all that I get.\u2019","But the tax collector
 standing at a distance
 would not even raise his eyes toward heaven
 but was striking his chest [in humility and repentance]
 saying
 \u2018God
 be merciful and gracious to me
 the [especially wicked] sinner [that I am]!\u2019 ","I tell you
 this man went to his home justified [forgiven of the guilt of sin and placed in right standing with God] rather than the other man; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled
 but he who humbles himself [forsaking self-righteous pride] will be exalted.\u201d","But Jesus called them to Himself
 saying [to the apostles]
 \u201cAllow the children to come to Me
 and do not forbid them
 for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. ","I assure you and most solemnly say to you
 whoever does not receive the kingdom of God [with faith and humility] like a child will not enter it at all.\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cWhy do you call Me good? No one is [essentially and morally] good except God alone. ","You know the commandments: \u2018Do not commit adultery
 Do not murder
 Do not steal
 Do not testify falsely
 Honor your father and your mother.\u2019\u201d ","He replied
 \u201cI have kept all these things from my youth.\u201d ","When Jesus heard this
 He said to him
 \u201cYou still lack one thing; sell everything that you have and distribute the money to the poor
 and you will have  treasure in heaven; and come
 follow Me [becoming My disciple
 believing and trusting in Me and walking the same path of life that I walk].\u201d ","Jesus looked at him and said
 \u201cHow difficult it is for those who are wealthy to enter the kingdom of God! ","For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man [who places his faith in wealth or status] to enter the kingdom of God.\u201d","But He said
 \u201cThe things that are impossible with people are possible with God.\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cI assure you and most solemnly say to you
 there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God
 ","who will not receive many times as much in this present age and in the age to come
 eternal life.\u201d","Then taking the twelve  aside
 He said to them
 \u201cListen carefully: we are going up to Jerusalem
 and all things that have been written through the prophets about the Son of Man will be fulfilled and completed. ","He will be betrayed and handed over to the Gentiles (Roman authorities)
 and will be mocked and ridiculed and insulted and abused and spit on
 ","and after they have scourged Him
 they will kill Him; and on the third day He will rise [from the dead].\u201d ","But the disciples understood none of these things [about the approaching death and resurrection of Jesus]. This statement was hidden from them
 and they did not grasp the [meaning of the] things that were said [by Jesus].","\u201cWhat do you want Me to do for you?\u201d He said
 \u201cLord
 let me regain my sight!\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cRegain your sight; your [personal trust and confident] faith [in Me] has made you well.\u201d ","When Jesus reached the place
 He looked up and said to him
 \u201cZaccheus
 hurry and come down
 for today I must stay at your house.\u201d ","Zaccheus stopped and said to the Lord
 \u201cSee
 Lord
 I am  giving half of my possessions to the poor
 and if I have cheated anyone out of anything
 I will give back four times as much.\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cToday salvation has come to this household
 because he
 too
 is a [spiritual] son of Abraham; ","for the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost.\u201d","So He said
 \u201cA nobleman went to a distant country to obtain for himself a kingdom
 and  to return. ","So he called ten of his servants
 and gave them ten minas [one apiece
 each equal to about a hundred days\u2019 wages] and said to them
 \u2018Do business [with this] until I return.\u2019 ","But his citizens [the residents of his new kingdom] hated him and sent a delegation after him
 saying
 \u2018We do not want this man to be a king over us.\u2019 ","When he returned
 after receiving the kingdom
 he ordered that these servants
 to whom he had given the money
 be called to him
 that he might find out what business they had done. ","The first one came before him and said
 \u2018Lord
 your mina has made ten more minas.\u2019 ","And he said to him
 \u2018Well done
 good servant! Because you proved yourself faithful and trustworthy in a very little thing
 you shall  have authority over ten cities [in my kingdom].\u2019 ","The second one came and said
 \u2018Lord
 your mina has made five minas.\u2019 ","And he said to him also
 \u2018And you shall take charge over five cities.\u2019 ","Then another came and said
 \u2018Lord
 here is your mina
 which I have kept laid up in a handkerchief [for safekeeping]. ","I was  afraid of you
 because you are a stern man; you pick up what you did not lay down and you reap what you did not sow.\u2019 ","He said to the servant
 \u2018I will judge and condemn you by your own words
 you worthless servant! Did you  know that I was a stern man
 picking up what I did not lay down and reaping what I did not sow? ","Then why did you not [at the very least] put my money in a bank? Then on my return
 I would have collected it with interest.\u2019 ","Then he said to the bystanders
 \u2018Take the mina away from him and give it to the one who has the ten minas.\u2019 ","And they said to him
 \u2018Lord
 he has ten minas already!\u2019 ","[Jesus explained
] \u2018I tell you that to everyone who has [because he valued his gifts from God and has used them wisely]
 more will be given; but from the one who does not have [because he disregarded his gifts from God]
 even what he has will be taken away.\u2019 ","[The king ended by saying
] \u2018But as for these enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them
 bring them here and kill them in my presence.\u2019\u201d","saying
 \u201cGo into the village ahead of you; there
 as you enter
 you will find a [donkey\u2019s] colt tied
 on which no one has ever sat. Untie it and bring it here. ","If anybody asks you
 \u2018Why are you untying the colt?\u2019 you will say
 \u2018The Lord needs it.\u2019\u201d ","Some of the Pharisees from the crowd said to Him
 \u201cTeacher
 rebuke Your disciples [for shouting these Messianic praises].\u201d ","Jesus replied
 \u201cI tell you
 if these  keep silent
 the stones will cry out [in praise]!\u201d","saying
 \u201cIf  you had known on this day [of salvation]
 even you
 the things which make for peace [and on which peace depends]! But now they have been hidden from your eyes. ","For a time [of siege] is coming when your enemies will put up a barricade [with pointed stakes] against you
 and surround you [with armies] and hem you in on every side
 ","and they will level you to the ground
 you  and your children within you. They will not leave in you one stone on another
 all because you did not [come progressively to] recognize [from observation and personal experience] the time of your visitation [when God was gracious toward you and offered you salvation].\u201d","saying to them
 \u201cIt is written
 \u2018My house shall be a house of prayer\u2019; but you have made it a robbers\u2019 den.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cI will also ask you a question. You tell Me: ","The baptism of John [the Baptist]\u2014was it from heaven [that is
 ordained by God] or from men?\u201d ","Then Jesus said to them
 \u201cNor am I telling you by what [kind of] authority I do these things.\u201d","Then He began to tell the people this parable: \u201cA man planted a vineyard and leased it to tenant farmers
 and went on a journey for a long time [to another country]. ","At harvest time he sent a servant [as his representative] to the tenants
 so that they would give him his share of the fruit of the vineyard; but the tenants beat the servant and sent him away empty-handed. ","So he again sent another servant; they also beat him and dishonored and treated him disgracefully and sent him away empty-handed.","And he sent yet a third; and this one too they wounded and threw out [of the vineyard].","Then the owner of the vineyard said
 \u2018What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; perhaps they will have respect for him.\u2019 ","But when the tenants saw him
 they discussed it among themselves
 saying
 \u2018This  is the heir; let us kill him so that the inheritance will be ours.\u2019 ","So they threw the son out of the vineyard and killed him. What
 then
 will the owner of the vineyard do to them? ","He will come and put these tenants to death and will give the vineyard to others.\u201d When the chief priests
 the scribes
 and the elders heard this
 they said
 \u201cMay it never be!\u201d ","But Jesus looked at them and said
 \u201cWhat then is [the meaning of] this that is written: \u2018The  Stone which the builders rejected
 this became the chief Cornerstone\u2019?","Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken and shattered in pieces; and on whomever it falls
 it will crush him.\u201d","So they watched [for a chance to trap] Him. They sent spies who pretended to be upright and sincere
 in order that they might catch Him in some statement [that they could distort and use against Him]
 so that they could turn Him over to the control and authority of  the governor. ","\u201cShow Me a  denarius. Whose image and inscription does the coin have?\u201d They answered
 \u201c[the Emperor Tiberius] Caesar\u2019s.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cThen pay to Caesar the things that are Caesar\u2019s
 and to God the things that are God\u2019s.\u201d ","They were not able to seize on anything He said in the presence of the people; and being unnerved at His reply
 they were silent.","Jesus said to them
 \u201cThe sons of this [world and present] age marry and [the women] are given in marriage; ","but those who are considered worthy to gain that [other world and that future] age and the resurrection from the dead
 neither marry nor are given in marriage; ","and they cannot die again
 because they are  like the angels (equal to
 angel-like). And they are children of God
 being participants in the resurrection. ","But [as for the fact] that the dead are raised [from death]
 even Moses showed
 in the passage about the burning bush
 when he calls the Lord the God of Abraham
 the God of Isaac
 and the God of Jacob. ","Now He is not the God of the dead
 but of the living [so these forefathers will be among the resurrected]; for all live [in a definite relationship] to Him.\u201d ","Then He said to them
 \u201cHow is it that people say that the Christ (the Messiah
 the Anointed) is David\u2019s son? ","For David himself says in the book of Psalms
 \u2018The Lord (the Father) said to my Lord (the Son
 the Messiah)
 \u201cSit at My right hand
","Until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet.\u201d\u2019","So David calls Him (the Son) \u2018Lord
\u2019 and how then is He David\u2019s son?\u201d","\u201cBeware of the scribes
 who like to walk around in long robes [displaying their prominence]
 and love respectful greetings in the  market places
 and chief seats in the synagogues and places of honor at banquets. ","These  who confiscate and devour widows\u2019 houses
 and for a pretense [to appear devout] offer long prayers. These  will receive the greater [sentence of] condemnation.\u201d","He said
 \u201cTruly I say to you
 this poor widow has put in  more than all of them; ","for they all put in gifts from their abundance; but she out of her poverty put in all she had to live on.\u201d","\u201cAs for all these things which you see
 the time will come when there will not be one stone left on another that will not be torn down.\u201d","He said
 \u201cBe careful and see to it that you are not misled; for many will come in My name [appropriating for themselves the name Messiah which belongs to Me alone]
 saying
 \u2018I am He
\u2019 and
 \u2018The time is near!\u2019 Do not follow them. ","When you hear of wars and disturbances [civil unrest
 revolts
 uprisings]
 do not panic; for these things must take place first
 but the end will not come immediately.\u201d","Then Jesus told them
 \u201cNation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom. ","There will be violent earthquakes
 and in various places famines and [deadly and devastating] pestilences (plagues
 epidemics); and there will be terrible sights and great signs from heaven.","\u201cBut before all these things
 they will lay their hands on you and will persecute you
 turning you over to the synagogues and prisons
 and bringing you before kings and governors for My name\u2019s sake. ","This will be a time and an opportunity for you to testify [about Me].","So make up your minds not to prepare beforehand to defend yourselves;","for I will give you  words and wisdom which none of your opponents will be able to resist or refute.","But you will be betrayed and handed over even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends
 and they will put some of you to death
 ","and you will be continually hated by everyone because of [your association with] My name.","But not a hair of your head will perish.","By your  endurance [empowered by the Holy Spirit] you will gain your souls.","\u201cBut when you see Jerusalem surrounded by  armies
 then understand [with confident assurance] that her complete destruction is near. ","At that time
 those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains
 and those who are inside the city (Jerusalem) must get out
 and those who are  in the country must not enter the city; ","for these are days of vengeance [of rendering full justice or satisfaction]
 so that all things which are written will be fulfilled. ","Woe to those women who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days! For great trouble and anguish will be on the land
 and wrath and retribution on this people . ","And they will fall by the edge of the sword
 and will be led captive into all nations; and Jerusalem will be trampled underfoot by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled (completed).","\u201cThere will be signs (attesting miracles) in the sun and moon and stars; and on the earth [there will be] distress and anguish among nations
 in perplexity at the roaring and tossing of the sea and the waves
 ","people fainting from fear and expectation of the  things coming on the world; for the  powers of the heavens will be shaken.","Then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with [transcendent
 overwhelming] power [subduing the nations] and with great glory. ","Now when these things begin to occur
 stand tall and lift up your heads [in joy]
 because [suffering ends as] your redemption is drawing near.\u201d","Then He told them a parable: \u201cLook at the fig tree and all the trees;","as soon as they put out leaves
 you see it and know for yourselves that summer is near. ","So you too
 when you see these things happening
 know [without any doubt] that the kingdom of God is near. ","I assure you and most solemnly say to you
 this generation [those living at that definite period of time preceding the second coming] will not pass away until everything takes place. ","Heaven and earth will pass away
 but My words will not pass away.","\u201cBut be on guard
 so that your hearts are not weighed down and depressed with the giddiness of debauchery and the nausea of self-indulgence and the worldly worries of life
 and then that day [when the Messiah returns] will not come on you suddenly like a trap; ","for it will come upon all those who live on the face of all the earth.","But keep alert at all times [be attentive and ready]
 praying that you may have the strength and ability [to be found worthy and] to escape all these things that are going to take place
 and to stand in the presence of the Son of Man [at His coming].\u201d","So Jesus sent Peter and John
 saying
 \u201cGo and prepare the Passover meal for us
 so that we may eat it.\u201d ","He replied
 \u201cWhen you have entered the city
 a man carrying an earthen jar of water will meet you; follow him into the house that he enters. ","And say to the owner of the house
 \u2018The Teacher asks
 \u201cWhere is the guest room in which I may eat the Passover with My disciples?\u201d\u2019 ","Then he will show you a large upstairs room
 furnished [with carpets and dining couches]; prepare the meal there.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cI have earnestly wanted to eat this Passover with you before I suffer; ","for I say to you
 I will not eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.\u201d ","And when He had taken a cup and given thanks
 He said
 \u201cTake this and share it among yourselves; ","for I say to you
 I will not drink of the fruit of the vine from now on until the kingdom of God comes.\u201d ","And when He had taken bread and given thanks
 He broke it and gave it to them
 saying
 \u201cThis is My body which is given for you; do this in remembrance of Me.\u201d ","And in the same way He took the cup after they had eaten
 saying
 \u201cThis cup
 which is poured out for you
 is the new covenant  in My blood. ","But listen
 the hand of the one betraying Me is with Mine on the table. ","For indeed
 the Son of Man is going as it has been determined; but woe (judgment is coming) to that man by whom He is betrayed and handed over!\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cThe kings of the Gentiles have absolute power and lord it over them; and those in authority over them are called \u2018Benefactors.\u2019 ","But it is not to be this way with you; on the contrary
 the one who is the greatest among you must become like the youngest [and least privileged]
 and the [one who is the] leader
 like the servant. ","For who is the greater
 the one who reclines at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines at the table? But I am among you as the one who serves.","\u201cYou are those who have remained and have stood by Me in My trials;","and just as My Father has granted Me a kingdom
 I grant you [the privilege] ","that you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom
 and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.","\u201cSimon
 Simon (Peter)
 listen! Satan has demanded permission to sift [all of] you like grain; ","but I have prayed  for you 
 that your faith [and confidence in Me] may not fail; and you
 once you have turned back again [to Me]
 strengthen and support your brothers [in the faith].\u201d ","And Peter said to Him
 \u201cLord
 I am ready to go with You both to prison and to death!\u201d ","Jesus said
 \u201cI say to you
 Peter
 before the rooster crows today
 you will  deny three times that you know Me.\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cWhen I sent you out without a money belt and  bag and  sandals
 did you lack anything?\u201d They answered
 \u201cNothing.\u201d ","Then He said to them
 \u201cBut now
 he who has a money belt is to take it along
 and also his  bag
 and he who has no sword is to sell his coat and buy one. ","For I tell you that this  which is written must be completed and fulfilled in Me: \u2018And He was counted with the criminals\u2019; for that which refers to Me has its fulfillment [and is settled].\u201d","They said
 \u201cLord
 look
 here are two swords.\u201d And He said to them
 \u201cIt is enough.\u201d","When He arrived at the place [called Gethsemane]
 He said to them
 \u201cPray continually that you may not fall into temptation.\u201d ","saying
 \u201cFather
 if You are willing
 remove this cup [of divine wrath] from Me; yet not My will
 but  Yours be done.\u201d ","and He said to them
 \u201cWhy are you sleeping? Get up and pray that you may not fall into temptation.\u201d","And Jesus said to him
 \u201cJudas
 are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?\u201d ","But Jesus replied
 \u201cStop! No more of this.\u201d And He touched the ear and healed him. ","Then Jesus said to the chief priests and officers of the temple and elders [of the Sanhedrin] who had come out against Him
 \u201cHave you come out with swords and clubs as you would against a robber? ","Day after day when I was with you in the temple
 you did not lay hands on Me; but this hour and the power and authority of darkness are yours.\u201d","The Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord
 how He had told him
 \u201cBefore a rooster crows today
 you will deny Me three times.\u201d ","\u201cIf You are the Christ (the Messiah
 the Anointed)
 tell us.\u201d But He said to them
 \u201cIf I tell you
 you will not believe [what I say]
 ","and if I ask a question
 you will not answer. ","But from now on
 the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.\u201d ","And they all said
 \u201cAre You the Son of God
 then?\u201d He replied
 \u201cIt is just as you say.\u201d ","So Pilate asked Him
 \u201cAre You the King of the Jews?\u201d And He answered him
 \u201cIt is just as you say.\u201d ","When Pilate heard it
 he asked whether the man was a Galilean. ","and said to them
 \u201cYou brought this man before me as one who corrupts and incites the people to rebellion. After examining Him before you
 I have found no guilt in this Man regarding the charges which you make against Him. ","A third time he said to them
 \u201cWhy
 what wrong has He done? I have found no guilt [no crime
 no offense] in Him demanding death; therefore I will punish Him [to teach Him a lesson] and release Him.\u201d ","But Jesus
 turning toward them
 said
 \u201cDaughters of Jerusalem
 do not weep for Me
 but weep for yourselves and for your children. ","For behold
 the days are coming when they will say
 \u2018Blessed are the barren
 and the wombs that have not given birth
 and the breasts that have never nursed.\u2019 ","Then they will begin to say to the mountains
 \u2018Fall on us!\u2019 and to the hills
 \u2018Cover us!\u2019 ","For if they do these things when the tree is green
 what will happen when it is dry?\u201d","And Jesus was saying
 \u201cFather
 forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing.\u201d And they cast lots
 dividing His clothes among themselves. ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cI assure you and most solemnly say to you
 today you will be with Me in Paradise.\u201d","And Jesus
 crying out with a loud voice
 said
 \u201cFather
 into Your hands I commit My spirit!\u201d Having said this
 He breathed His last. ","and as the women were terrified and were bowing their faces to the ground
 the men said to them
 \u201cWhy are you looking for the living One among the dead? ","Then Jesus asked them
 \u201cWhat are you discussing with one another as you walk along?\u201d And they stood still
 looking brokenhearted. ","He asked
 \u201cWhat things?\u201d And they replied
 \u201cThe things about Jesus of Nazareth
 who was a prophet powerful in deed and word in the sight of God and all the people
 ","Then Jesus said to them
 \u201cO foolish men
 and slow of heart to trust and believe in everything that the prophets have spoken! ","Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and [only then to] enter His glory?\u201d","While they were talking about this
 Jesus Himself  stood among them and said to them
 \u201cPeace be to you.\u201d ","And He said
 \u201cWhy are you troubled
 and why are doubts rising in your hearts? ","Look at [the marks in] My hands and My feet
 [and see] that it is I Myself. Touch Me and see; a spirit does not have flesh and bones
 as you see that I have.\u201d ","While they still did not believe it because of their joy and amazement
 He asked them
 \u201cDo you have anything here to eat?\u201d ","Then He said to them
 \u201cThis is what I told you while I was still with you
 everything which has been written about Me in the Law of Moses and the [writings of the] Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled.\u201d ","and said
 \u201cAnd so it is written
 that the Christ (the Messiah
 the Anointed) would suffer and rise from the dead on the third day
 ","and that repentance  for forgiveness of sins would be preached in His name to all the nations
 beginning from Jerusalem. ","You are witnesses of these things.","Listen carefully: I am sending the Promise of My Father [the Holy Spirit] upon you; but you are to remain in the city [of Jerusalem] until you are clothed (fully equipped) with power from on high.\u201d","And He said to them
 How is it that you had to look for Me? Did you not see and know that it is necessary [as a duty] for Me to be in My Father\u2019s house and [occupied] about My Father\u2019s business?","And Jesus replied to him
 It is written
 Man shall not live and be sustained by (on) bread alone but by every word and expression of God.","And he said to Him
 To You I will give all this power and authority and their glory (all their magnificence
 excellence
 preeminence
 dignity
 and grace)
 for it has been turned over to me
 and I give it to whomever I will.","And Jesus replied to him
 Get behind Me
 Satan! It is written
 You shall do homage to and worship the Lord your God
 and Him only shall you serve.","Then he took Him to Jerusalem and set Him on a gable of the temple
 and said to Him
 If You are the Son of God
 cast Yourself down from here;","And Jesus replied to him
 [The Scripture] says
 You shall not tempt (try
 test exceedingly) the Lord your God.","The Spirit of the Lord [is] upon Me
 because He has anointed Me [the Anointed One
 the Messiah] to preach the good news (the Gospel) to the poor; He has sent Me to announce release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind
 to send forth as delivered those who are oppressed [who are downtrodden
 bruised
 crushed
 and broken down by calamity]
","To proclaim the accepted and acceptable year of the Lord [the day when salvation and the free favors of God profusely abound].","And He began to speak to them: Today this Scripture has been fulfilled while you are present and hearing.","So He said to them
 You will doubtless quote to Me this proverb: Physician
 heal Yourself! What we have learned by hearsay that You did in Capernaum
 do here also in Your [own] town.","Then He said
 Solemnly I say to you
 no prophet is acceptable and welcome in his [own] town (country).","But in truth I tell you
 there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah
 when the heavens were closed up for three years and six months
 so that there came a great famine over all the land;","And yet Elijah was not sent to a single one of them
 but only to Zarephath in the country of Sidon
 to a woman who was a widow.","And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet
 and yet not one of them was cleansed [by being healed]\u2014but only Naaman the Syrian.","And they were amazed at His teaching
 for His word was with authority and ability and weight and power.","But Jesus rebuked him
 saying
 Be silent (muzzled
 gagged)
 and come out of him! And when the demon had thrown the man down in their midst
 he came out of him without injuring him in any possible way.","And demons even came out of many people
 screaming and crying out
 You are the Son of God! But He rebuked them and would not permit them to speak
 because they knew that He was the Christ (the Messiah).","But He said to them
 I must preach the good news (the Gospel) of the kingdom of God to the other cities [and towns] also
 for I was sent for this [purpose].","When He had stopped speaking
 He said to Simon (Peter)
 Put out into the deep [water]
 and lower your nets for a haul.","And so also were James and John
 the sons of Zebedee
 who were partners with Simon (Peter). And Jesus said to Simon
 Have no fear; from now on you will be catching men!","And [Jesus] reached out His hand and touched him
 saying
 I am willing; be cleansed! And immediately the leprosy left him.","And [Jesus] charged him to tell no one [that he might chance to meet]
 until [He said] you go and show yourself to the priest
 and make an offering for your purification
 as Moses commanded
 for a testimony and proof to the people
 that they may have evidence [of your healing].","And when He saw [their confidence in Him
 springing from] their faith
 He said
 Man
 your sins are forgiven you!","But Jesus
 knowing their thoughts and questionings
 answered them
 Why do you question in your hearts?","Which is easier: to say
 Your sins are forgiven you
 or to say
 Arise and walk [about]?","But that you may know that the Son of Man has the [power of] authority and right on earth to forgive sins
 He said to the paralyzed man
 I say to you
 arise
 pick up your litter (stretcher)
 and go to your own house!","And after this
 Jesus went out and looked [attentively] at a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax office; and He said to him
 Join Me as a disciple and side with My party and accompany Me.","And Jesus replied to them
 It is not those who are healthy who need a physician
 but those who are sick.","I have not come to arouse and invite and call the righteous
 but the erring ones (those not free from sin) to repentance [to change their minds for the better and heartily to amend their ways
 with abhorrence of their past sins].","Then they said to Him
 The disciples of John practice fasting often and offer up prayers of [special] petition
 and so do [the disciples] of the Pharisees also
 but Yours eat and drink.","And Jesus said to them
 Can you make the wedding guests fast as long as the bridegroom is with them?","But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; and then they will fast in those days.","He told them a proverb also: No one puts a patch from a new garment on an old garment; if he does
 he will both tear the new one
 and the patch from the new [one] will not match the old [garment].","And no one pours new wine into old wineskins; if he does
 the fresh wine will burst the skins and it will be spilled and the skins will be ruined (destroyed).","But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins.","And no one after drinking old wine immediately desires new wine
 for he says
 The old is good or better.","And Jesus replied to them
 saying
 Have you never so much as read what David did when he was hungry
 he and those who were with him?\u2014","How he went into the house of God and took and ate the [sacred] loaves of the showbread
 which it is not permitted for any except only the priests to eat
 and also gave to those [who were] with him?","And He said to them
 The Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.","But He was aware all along of their thoughts
 and He said to the man with the withered hand
 Come and stand here in the midst. And he arose and stood there.","Then Jesus said to them
 I ask you
 is it lawful and right on the Sabbath to do good [so that someone derives advantage from it] or to do evil
 to save a life [and make a soul safe] or to destroy it?","Then He glanced around at them all and said to the man
 Stretch out your hand! And he did so
 and his hand was fully restored like the other one.","Blessed (happy\u2014with life-joy and satisfaction in God\u2019s favor and salvation
 apart from your outward condition\u2014and to be envied) are you who hunger and seek with eager desire now
 for you shall be filled and completely satisfied! Blessed (happy\u2014with life-joy and satisfaction in God\u2019s favor and salvation
 apart from your outward condition\u2014and to be envied) are you who weep and sob now
 for you shall laugh!","Blessed (happy\u2014with life-joy and satisfaction in God\u2019s favor and salvation

 and when they exclude and excommunicate you [as disreputable] and revile and denounce you and defame and cast out and spurn your name as evil (wicked) on account of the Son of Man.","Rejoice and be glad at such a time and exult and leap for joy
 for behold
 your reward is rich and great and strong and intense and abundant in heaven; for even so their forefathers treated the prophets.","But woe to (alas for) you who are rich (abounding in material resources)
 for you already are receiving your consolation (the solace and sense of strengthening and cheer that come from prosperity) and have taken and enjoyed your comfort in full [having nothing left to be awarded you].","Woe to (alas for) you who are full now (completely filled
 luxuriously gorged and satiated)

 offer the other jaw or cheek also; and from him who takes away your outer garment
 do not withhold your undergarment as well.","Give away to everyone who begs of you [who is in want of necessities]
 and of him who takes away from you your goods
 do not demand or require them back again.","And as you would like and desire that men would do to you
 do exactly so to them.","If you [merely] love those who love you
 what quality of credit and thanks is that to you? For even the [very] sinners love their lovers (those who love them).","And if you are kind and good and do favors to and benefit those who are kind and good and do favors to and benefit you
 what quality of credit and thanks is that to you? For even the preeminently sinful do the same.","And if you lend money at interest to those from whom you hope to receive
 what quality of credit and thanks is that to you? Even notorious sinners lend money at interest to sinners
 so as to recover as much again.","But love your enemies and be kind and do good [doing favors so that someone derives benefit from them] and lend
 expecting and hoping for nothing in return but considering nothing as lost and despairing of no one; and then your recompense (your reward) will be great (rich
 strong
 intense
 and abundant)
 and you will be sons of the Most High
 for He is kind and charitable and good to the ungrateful and the selfish and wicked.","So be merciful (sympathetic
 tender
 responsive
 and compassionate) even as your Father is [all these].","Judge not [neither pronouncing judgment nor subjecting to censure]
 and you will not be judged; do not condemn and pronounce guilty
 and you will not be condemned and pronounced guilty; acquit and forgive and release (give up resentment
 let it drop)
 and you will be acquitted and forgiven and released.","Give
 and [gifts] will be given to you; good measure
 pressed down
 shaken together
 and running over
 will they pour into [the pouch formed by] the bosom [of your robe and used as a bag]. For with the measure you deal out [with the measure you use when you confer benefits on others]
 it will be measured back to you.","He further told them a proverb: Can a blind [man] guide and direct a blind [man]? Will they not both stumble into a ditch or a hole in the ground?","A pupil is not superior to his teacher
 but everyone [when he is] completely trained (readjusted
 restored
 set to rights
 and perfected) will be like his teacher.","Why do you see the speck that is in your brother\u2019s eye but do not notice or consider the beam [of timber] that is in your own eye?","Or how can you say to your brother
 Brother
 allow me to take out the speck that is in your eye
 when you yourself do not see the beam that is in your own eye? You actor (pretender
 hypocrite)! First take the beam out of your own eye
 and then you will see clearly to take out the speck that is in your brother\u2019s eye.","For there is no good (healthy) tree that bears decayed (worthless
 stale) fruit
 nor on the other hand does a decayed (worthless
 sickly) tree bear good fruit.","For each tree is known and identified by its own fruit; for figs are not gathered from thornbushes
 nor is a cluster of grapes picked from a bramblebush.","The upright (honorable
 intrinsically good) man out of the good treasure [stored] in his heart produces what is upright (honorable and intrinsically good)
 and the evil man out of the evil storehouse brings forth that which is depraved (wicked and intrinsically evil); for out of the abundance (overflow) of the heart his mouth speaks.","Why do you call Me
 Lord
 Lord
 and do not [practice] what I tell you?","For everyone who comes to Me and listens to My words [in order to heed their teaching] and does them
 I will show you what he is like:","He is like a man building a house
 who dug and went down deep and laid a foundation upon the rock; and when a flood arose
 the torrent broke against that house and could not shake or move it
 because it had been securely built or founded on a rock.","But he who merely hears and does not practice doing My words is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation
 against which the torrent burst
 and immediately it collapsed and fell
 and the breaking and ruin of that house was great.","Now when Jesus heard this
 He marveled at him
 and He turned and said to the crowd that followed Him
 I tell you
 not even in [all] Israel have I found such great faith [as this].","And when the Lord saw her
 He had compassion on her and said to her
 Do not weep.","And He went forward and touched the funeral bier
 and the pallbearers stood still. And He said
 Young man
 I say to you
 arise [from death]!","So He replied to them
 Go and tell John what you have seen and heard: the blind receive their sight
 the lame walk
 the lepers are cleansed
 the deaf hear
 the dead are raised up
 and the poor have the good news (the Gospel) preached to them.","And blessed (happy\u2014with life-joy and satisfaction in God\u2019s favor and salvation
 apart from outward conditions\u2014and to be envied) is he who takes no offense in Me and who is not hurt or resentful or annoyed or repelled or made to stumble [whatever may occur].","And the messengers of John having departed
 Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: What did you go out into the desert to gaze on? A reed shaken and swayed by the wind?","Then what did you go out to see? A man dressed up in soft garments? Behold
 those who wear fine apparel and live in luxury are in the courts or palaces of kings.","What then did you go out to see? A prophet (a forthteller)? Yes
 I tell you
 and far more than a prophet.","This is the one of whom it is written
 Behold
 I send My messenger before Your face
 who shall make ready Your way before You.","I tell you
 among those born of women there is no one greater than John; but he that is inferior [to the other citizens] in the kingdom of God is greater [in incomparable privilege] than he.","So to what shall I compare the men of this generation? And what are they like?","They are like little children sitting in the marketplace
 calling to one another and saying
 We piped to you [playing wedding]
 and you did not dance; we sang dirges and wailed [playing funeral]
 and you did not weep.","For John the Baptist has come neither eating bread nor drinking wine
 and you say
 He has a demon.","The Son of Man has come eating and drinking
 and you say
 Behold
 a Man Who is a glutton and a wine drinker
 a friend of tax collectors and notorious sinners.","Yet wisdom is vindicated (shown to be true and divine) by all her children [by their life
 character
 and deeds].","Now when the Pharisee who had invited Him saw it
 he said to himself
 If this Man were a prophet
 He would surely know who and what sort of woman this is who is touching Him\u2014for she is a notorious sinner (a social outcast
 devoted to sin).","And Jesus
 replying
 said to him
 Simon
 I have something to say to you. And he answered
 Teacher
 say it.","A certain lender of money [at interest] had two debtors: one owed him five hundred denarii
 and the other fifty.","When they had no means of paying
 he freely forgave them both. Now which of them will love him more?","Simon answered
 The one
 I take it
 for whom he forgave and cancelled more. And Jesus said to him
 You have decided correctly.","Then turning toward the woman
 He said to Simon
 Do you see this woman? When I came into your house
 you gave Me no water for My feet
 but she has wet My feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.","You gave Me no kiss
 but she from the moment I came in has not ceased [intermittently] to kiss My feet tenderly and caressingly.","You did not anoint My head with [cheap
 ordinary] oil
 but she has anointed My feet with [costly
 rare] perfume.","Therefore I tell you
 her sins
 many [as they are]
 are forgiven her\u2014because she has loved much. But he who is forgiven little loves little.","And He said to her
 Your sins are forgiven!","But Jesus said to the woman
 Your faith has saved you; go (enter) into peace [in freedom from all the distresses that are experienced as the result of sin].","And when a very great throng was gathering together and people from town after town kept coming to Jesus
 He said in a parable:","A sower went out to sow seed; and as he sowed
 some fell along the traveled path and was trodden underfoot
 and the birds of the air ate it up.","And some [seed] fell on the rock
 and as soon as it sprouted
 it withered away because it had no moisture.","And other [seed] fell in the midst of the thorns
 and the thorns grew up with it and choked it [off].","And some seed fell into good soil
 and grew up and yielded a crop a hundred times [as great]. As He said these things
 He called out
 He who has ears to hear
 let him be listening and let him consider and understand by hearing!","He said to them
 To you it has been given to [come progressively to] know (to recognize and understand more strongly and clearly) the mysteries and secrets of the kingdom of God
 but for others they are in parables
 so that
 [though] looking
 they may not see; and hearing
 they may not comprehend.","Now the meaning of the parable is this: The seed is the Word of God.","Those along the traveled road are the people who have heard; then the devil comes and carries away the message out of their hearts
 that they may not believe (acknowledge Me as their Savior and devote themselves to Me) and be saved [here and hereafter].","And those upon the rock [are the people] who
 when they hear [the Word]
 receive and welcome it with joy; but these have no root. They believe for a while
 and in time of trial and temptation fall away (withdraw and stand aloof).","And as for what fell among the thorns
 these are [the people] who hear
 but as they go on their way they are choked and suffocated with the anxieties and cares and riches and pleasures of life
 and their fruit does not ripen (come to maturity and perfection).","But as for that [seed] in the good soil
 these are [the people] who
 hearing the Word
 hold it fast in a just (noble
 virtuous) and worthy heart
 and steadily bring forth fruit with patience.","No one after he has lighted a lamp covers it with a vessel or puts it under a [dining table] couch; but he puts it on a lampstand
 that those who come in may see the light.","For there is nothing hidden that shall not be disclosed
 nor anything secret that shall not be known and come out into the open.","Be careful therefore how you listen. For to him who has [spiritual knowledge] will more be given; and from him who does not have [spiritual knowledge]
 even what he thinks and guesses and supposes that he has will be taken away.","And it was told Him
 Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside
 desiring to have an interview with You.","But He answered them
 My mother and My brothers are those who listen to the Word of God and do it!","One of those days He and His disciples got into a boat
 and He said to them
 Let us go across to the other side of the lake. So they put out to sea.","And He said to them
 [Why are you so fearful?] Where is your faith (your trust
 your confidence in Me\u2014in My veracity and My integrity)? And they were seized with alarm and profound and reverent dread
 and they marveled
 saying to one another
 Who then is this
 that He commands even wind and sea
 and they obey Him?","Jesus then asked him
 What is your name? And he answered
 Legion; for many demons had entered him.","Return to your home
 and recount [the story] of how many and great things God has done for you. And [the man] departed
 proclaiming throughout the whole city how much Jesus had done for him.","And Jesus said
 Who is it who touched Me? When all were denying it
 Peter and those who were with him said
 Master
 the multitudes surround You and press You on every side!","But Jesus said
 Someone did touch Me; for I perceived that [healing] power has gone forth from Me.","And He said to her
 Daughter
 your faith (your confidence and trust in Me) has made you well! Go (enter) into peace (untroubled
 undisturbed well-being).","But Jesus
 on hearing this
 answered him
 Do not be seized with alarm or struck with fear; simply believe [in Me as able to do this]
 and she shall be made well.","And all were weeping for and bewailing her; but He said
 Do not weep
 for she is not dead but sleeping.","And grasping her hand
 He called
 saying
 Child
 arise [from the sleep of death]!","And He said to them
 Do not take anything for your journey\u2014neither walking stick
 nor wallet [for a collection bag]
 nor food of any kind
 nor money
 and do not have two undergarments (tunics).","And whatever house you enter
 stay there until you go away [from that place].","And wherever they do not receive and accept and welcome you
 when you leave that town shake off [even] the dust from your feet
 as a testimony against them.","But He said to them
 You [yourselves] give them [food] to eat. They said
 We have no more than five loaves and two fish\u2014unless we are to go and buy food for all this crowd
","For there were about 5
000 men. And [Jesus] said to His disciples
 Have them [sit down] reclining in table groups (companies) of about fifty each.","Now it occurred that as Jesus was praying privately
 the disciples were with Him
 and He asked them
 Who do men say that I am?","And He said to them
 But who do you [yourselves] say that I am? And Peter replied
 The Christ of God!","Saying
 The Son of Man must suffer many things and be [deliberately] disapproved and repudiated and rejected on the part of the elders and chief priests and scribes
 and be put to death and on the third day be raised [again].","And He said to all
 If any person wills to come after Me
 let him deny himself [disown himself
 forget
 lose sight of himself and his own interests
 refuse and give up himself] and take up his cross daily and follow Me [cleave steadfastly to Me
 conform wholly to My example in living and
 if need be
 in dying also].","For whoever would preserve his life and save it will lose and destroy it
 but whoever loses his life for My sake
 he will preserve and save it [from the penalty of eternal death].","For what does it profit a man
 if he gains the whole world and ruins or forfeits (loses) himself?","Because whoever is ashamed of Me and of My teachings
 of him will the Son of Man be ashamed when He comes in the [threefold] glory (the splendor and majesty) of Himself and of the Father and of the holy angels.","However I tell you truly
 there are some of those standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God.","And it occurred as the men were parting from Him that Peter said to Jesus
 Master
 it is delightful and good that we are here; and let us construct three booths or huts\u2014one for You and one for Moses and one for Elijah! not noticing or knowing what he was saying.","Jesus answered
 O [faithless ones] unbelieving and without trust in God
 a perverse (wayward
 crooked and warped) generation! Until when and how long am I to be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here [to Me].","Let these words sink into your ears: the Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men [whose conduct is opposed to God].","And told them
 Whoever receives and accepts and welcomes this child in My name and for My sake receives and accepts and welcomes Me; and whoever so receives Me so also receives Him Who sent Me. For he who is least and lowliest among you all\u2014he is [the one who is truly] great.","But Jesus told him
 Do not forbid [such people]; for whoever is not against you is for you.","And Jesus told him
 Foxes have lurking holes and the birds of the air have roosts and nests
 but the Son of Man has no place to lay His head.","And He said to another
 Become My disciple
 side with My party
 and accompany Me! But he replied
 Lord
 permit me first to go and bury (await the death of) my father.","But Jesus said to him
 Allow the dead to bury their own dead; but as for you
 go and publish abroad throughout all regions the kingdom of God.","Jesus said to him
 No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back [to the things behind] is fit for the kingdom of God.","And He said to them
 The harvest indeed is abundant [there is much ripe grain]
 but the farmhands are few. Pray therefore the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest.","Go your way; behold
 I send you out like lambs into the midst of wolves.","Carry no purse
 no provisions bag
 no [change of] sandals; refrain from [retarding your journey by] saluting and wishing anyone well along the way.","Whatever house you enter
 first say
 Peace be to this household! [Freedom from all the distresses that result from sin be with this family].","And if anyone [worthy] of peace and blessedness is there
 the peace and blessedness you wish shall come upon him; but if not
 it shall come back to you.","And stay on in the same house
 eating and drinking what they provide
 for the laborer is worthy of his wages. Do not keep moving from house to house.","Whenever you go into a town and they receive and accept and welcome you
 eat what is set before you;","And heal the sick in it and say to them
 The kingdom of God has come close to you.","But whenever you go into a town and they do not receive and accept and welcome you
 go out into its streets and say
","Even the dust of your town that clings to our feet we are wiping off against you; yet know and understand this: the kingdom of God has come near you.","I tell you
 it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom than for that town.","Woe to you
 Chorazin! Woe to you
 Bethsaida! For if the mighty miracles performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon
 they would have repented long ago
 sitting in sackcloth and ashes.","However
 it shall be more tolerable in the judgment for Tyre and Sidon than for you.","And you
 Capernaum
 will you be exalted unto heaven? You shall be brought down to Hades (the regions of the dead).","He who hears and heeds you [disciples] hears and heeds Me; and he who slights and rejects you slights and rejects Me; and he who slights and rejects Me slights and rejects Him who sent Me.","And He said to them
 I saw Satan falling like a lightning [flash] from heaven.","Behold! I have given you authority and power to trample upon serpents and scorpions
 and [physical and mental strength and ability] over all the power that the enemy [possesses]; and nothing shall in any way harm you.","Nevertheless
 do not rejoice at this
 that the spirits are subject to you
 but rejoice that your names are enrolled in heaven.","In that same hour He rejoiced and gloried in the Holy Spirit and said
 I thank You
 Father
 Lord of heaven and earth
 that You have concealed these things [relating to salvation] from the wise and understanding and learned
 and revealed them to babes (the childish
 unskilled
 and untaught). Yes
 Father
 for such was Your gracious will and choice and good pleasure.","All things have been given over into My power by My Father; and no one knows Who the Son is except the Father
 or Who the Father is except the Son and anyone to whom the Son may choose to reveal and make Him known.","Then turning to His disciples
 He said privately
 Blessed (happy
 to be envied) are those whose eyes see what you see!","For I tell you that many prophets and kings longed to see what you see and they did not see it
 and to hear what you hear and they did not hear it.","And then a certain lawyer arose to try (test
 tempt) Him
 saying
 Teacher
 what am I to do to inherit everlasting life [that is
 to partake of eternal salvation in the Messiah\u2019s kingdom]?","Jesus said to him
 What is written in the Law? How do you read it?","And Jesus said to him
 You have answered correctly; do this
 and you will live [enjoy active
 blessed
 endless life in the kingdom of God].","Jesus
 taking him up
 replied
 A certain man was going from Jerusalem down to Jericho
 and he fell among robbers
 who stripped him of his clothes and belongings and beat him and went their way
 [unconcernedly] leaving him half dead
 as it happened.","Now by coincidence a certain priest was going down along that road
 and when he saw him
 he passed by on the other side.","A Levite likewise came down to the place and saw him
 and passed by on the other side [of the road].","But a certain Samaritan
 as he traveled along
 came down to where he was; and when he saw him
 he was moved with pity and sympathy [for him]
","And went to him and dressed his wounds
 pouring on [them] oil and wine. Then he set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn and took care of him.","And the next day he took out two denarii [two day\u2019s wages] and gave [them] to the innkeeper
 saying
 Take care of him; and whatever more you spend
 I [myself] will repay you when I return.","Which of these three do you think proved himself a neighbor to him who fell among the robbers?","He answered
 The one who showed pity and mercy to him. And Jesus said to him
 Go and do likewise.","But the Lord replied to her by saying
 Martha
 Martha
 you are anxious and troubled about many things;","There is need of only one or but a few things. Mary has chosen the good portion [that which is to her advantage]
 which shall not be taken away from her.","Then He was praying in a certain place; and when He stopped
 one of His disciples said to Him
 Lord
 teach us to pray
 [just] as John taught his disciples.","And He said to them
 When you pray
 say: Our Father Who is in heaven
 hallowed be Your name
 Your kingdom come. Your will be done [held holy and revered] on earth as it is in heaven.","Give us daily our bread [food for the morrow].","And forgive us our sins
 for we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us [who has offended us or done us wrong]. And bring us not into temptation but rescue us from evil.","And He said to them
 Which of you who has a friend will go to him at midnight and will say to him
 Friend
 lend me three loaves [of bread]
","For a friend of mine who is on a journey has just come
 and I have nothing to put before him;","And he from within will answer
 Do not disturb me; the door is now closed
 and my children are with me in bed; I cannot get up and supply you [with anything]?","I tell you
 although he will not get up and supply him anything because he is his friend
 yet because of his shameless persistence and insistence he will get up and give him as much as he needs.","So I say to you
 Ask and keep on asking and it shall be given you; seek and keep on seeking and you shall find; knock and keep on knocking and the door shall be opened to you.","For everyone who asks and keeps on asking receives; and he who seeks and keeps on seeking finds; and to him who knocks and keeps on knocking
 the door shall be opened.","What father among you
 if his son asks for a loaf of bread
 will give him a stone; or if he asks for a fish
 will instead of a fish give him a serpent?","Or if he asks for an egg
 will give him a scorpion?","If you then
 evil as you are
 know how to give good gifts [gifts that are to their advantage] to your children
 how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask and continue to ask Him!","Now Jesus was driving out a demon that was dumb; and it occurred that when the demon had gone out
 the dumb man spoke. And the crowds marveled.","But He
 [well] aware of their intent and purpose
 said to them
 Every kingdom split up against itself is doomed and brought to desolation
 and so house falls upon house. [The disunited household will collapse.]","And if Satan also is divided against himself
 how will his kingdom last? For you say that I expel demons with the help of and by Beelzebub.","Now if I expel demons with the help of and by Beelzebub
 with whose help and by whom do your sons drive them out? Therefore they shall be your judges.","But if I drive out the demons by the finger of God
 then the kingdom of God has [already] come upon you.","When the strong man
 fully armed
 [from his courtyard] guards his own dwelling
 his belongings are undisturbed [his property is at peace and is secure].","But when one stronger than he attacks him and conquers him
 he robs him of his whole armor on which he had relied and divides up and distributes all his goods as plunder (spoil).","He who is not with Me [siding and believing with Me] is against Me
 and he who does not gather with Me [engage in My interest]
 scatters.","When the unclean spirit has gone out of a person
 it roams through waterless places in search [of a place] of rest (release
 refreshment
 ease); and finding none it says
 I will go back to my house from which I came.","And when it arrives
 it finds [the place] swept and put in order and furnished and decorated.","And it goes and brings other spirits
 seven [of them]
 more evil than itself
 and they enter in
 settle down
 and dwell there; and the last state of that person is worse than the first.","Now it occurred that as He was saying these things
 a certain woman in the crowd raised her voice and said to Him
 Blessed (happy and to be envied) is the womb that bore You and the breasts that You sucked!","But He said
 Blessed (happy and to be envied) rather are those who hear the Word of God and obey and practice it!","Now as the crowds were [increasingly] thronging Him
 He began to say
 This present generation is a wicked one; it seeks and demands a sign (miracle)
 but no sign shall be given to it except the sign of Jonah [the prophet].","For [just] as Jonah became a sign to the people of Nineveh
 so will also the Son of Man be [a sign] to this age and generation.","The queen of the South will arise in the judgment with the people of this age and generation and condemn them; for she came from the ends of the [inhabited] earth to listen to the wisdom of Solomon
 and notice
 here is more than Solomon.","The men of Nineveh will appear as witnesses at the judgment with this generation and will condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah
 and behold
 here is more than Jonah.","No one after lighting a lamp puts it in a cellar or crypt or under a bushel measure
 but on a lampstand
 that those who are coming in may see the light.","Your eye is the lamp of your body; when your eye (your conscience) is sound and fulfilling its office
 your whole body is full of light; but when it is not sound and is not fulfilling its office
 your body is full of darkness.","Be careful
 therefore
 that the light that is in you is not darkness.","If then your entire body is illuminated
 having no part dark
 it will be wholly bright [with light]
 as when a lamp with its bright rays gives you light.","But the Lord said to him
 Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the plate
 but inside you yourselves are full of greed and robbery and extortion and malice and wickedness.","You senseless (foolish
 stupid) ones [acting without reflection or intelligence]! Did not He Who made the outside make the inside also?","But [dedicate your inner self and] give as donations to the poor of those things which are within [of inward righteousness] and behold
 everything is purified and clean for you.","But woe to you
 Pharisees! For you tithe mint and rue and every [little] herb
 but disregard and neglect justice and the love of God. These you ought to have done without leaving the others undone.","Woe to you
 Pharisees! For you love the best seats in the synagogues and [you love] to be greeted and bowed down to in the [public] marketplaces.","Woe to you! For you are like graves which are not marked or seen
 and men walk over them without being aware of it [and are ceremonially defiled].","But He said
 Woe to you
 the lawyers
 also! For you load men with oppressive burdens hard to bear
 and you do not personally [even gently] touch the burdens with one of your fingers.","Woe to you! For you are rebuilding and repairing the tombs of the prophets
 whom your fathers killed (destroyed).","So you bear witness and give your full approval and consent to the deeds of your fathers; for they actually killed them
 and you rebuild and repair monuments to them.","For this reason also the wisdom of God said
 I will send them prophets and apostles
 [some] of whom they will put to death and persecute
","So that the blood of all the prophets shed from the foundation of the world may be charged against and required of this age and generation
","From the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah
 who was slain between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes
 I tell you
 it shall be charged against and required of this age and generation.","Woe to you
 lawyers (experts in the Mosaic Law)! For you have taken away the key to knowledge; you did not go in yourselves
 and you hindered and prevented those who were entering.","In the meanwhile
 when so many thousands of the people had gathered that they were trampling on one another
 Jesus commenced by saying primarily to His disciples
 Be on your guard against the leaven (ferment) of the Pharisees
 which is hypocrisy [producing unrest and violent agitation].","Nothing is [so closely] covered up that it will not be revealed
 or hidden that it will not be known.","Whatever you have spoken in the darkness shall be heard and listened to in the light
 and what you have whispered in [people\u2019s] ears and behind closed doors will be proclaimed upon the housetops.","I tell you
 My friends
 do not dread and be afraid of those who kill the body and after that have nothing more that they can do.","But I will warn you whom you should fear: fear Him Who
 after killing
 has power to hurl into hell (Gehenna); yes
 I say to you
 fear Him!","Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? And [yet] not one of them is forgotten or uncared for in the presence of God.","But [even] the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Do not be struck with fear or seized with alarm; you are of greater worth than many [flocks] of sparrows.","And I tell you
 Whoever declares openly [speaking out freely] and confesses that he is My worshiper and acknowledges Me before men
 the Son of Man also will declare and confess and acknowledge him before the angels of God.","But he who disowns and denies and rejects and refuses to acknowledge Me before men will be disowned and denied and rejected and refused acknowledgement in the presence of the angels of God.","And everyone who makes a statement or speaks a word against the Son of Man
 it will be forgiven him; but he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit [that is
 whoever intentionally comes short of the reverence due the Holy Spirit]
 it will not be forgiven him [for him there is no forgiveness].","And when they bring you before the synagogues and the magistrates and the authorities
 do not be anxious [beforehand] how you shall reply in defense or what you are to say.","For the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour and moment what [you] ought to say.","But He told him
 Man
 who has appointed Me a judge or umpire and divider over you?","And He said to them
 Guard yourselves and keep free from all covetousness (the immoderate desire for wealth
 the greedy longing to have more); for a man\u2019s life does not consist in and is not derived from possessing overflowing abundance or that which is over and above his needs.","Then He told them a parable
 saying
 The land of a rich man was fertile and yielded plentifully.","And he considered and debated within himself
 What shall I do? I have no place [in which] to gather together my harvest.","And he said
 I will do this: I will pull down my storehouses and build larger ones
 and there I will store all my grain or produce and my goods.","And I will say to my soul
 Soul
 you have many good things laid up
 [enough] for many years. Take your ease; eat
 drink
 and enjoy yourself merrily.","But God said to him
 You fool! This very night  they [the messengers of God] will demand your soul of you; and all the things that you have prepared
 whose will they be?","So it is with the one who continues to lay up and hoard possessions for himself and is not rich [in his relation] to God [this is how he fares].","And [Jesus] said to His disciples
 Therefore I tell you
 do not be anxious and troubled [with cares] about your life
 as to what you will [have to] eat; or about your body
 as to what you will [have to] wear.","For life is more than food
 and the body [more] than clothes.","Observe and consider the ravens; for they neither sow nor reap
 they have neither storehouse nor barn; and [yet] God feeds them. Of how much more worth are you than the birds!","And which of you by being overly anxious and troubled with cares can add a cubit to his stature or a moment [unit] of time to his age [the length of his life]?","If then you are not able to do such a little thing as that
 why are you anxious and troubled with cares about the rest?","Consider the lilies
 how they grow. They neither [wearily] toil nor spin nor weave; yet I tell you
 even Solomon in all his glory (his splendor and magnificence) was not arrayed like one of these.","But if God so clothes the grass in the field
 which is alive today
 and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace
 how much more will He clothe you
 O you [people] of little faith?","And you
 do not seek [by meditating and reasoning to inquire into] what you are to eat and what you are to drink; nor be of anxious (troubled) mind [unsettled
 excited
 worried
 and in suspense];","For all the pagan world is [greedily] seeking these things
 and your Father knows that you need them.","Only aim at and strive for and seek His kingdom
 and all these things shall be supplied to you also.","Do not be seized with alarm and struck with fear
 little flock
 for it is your Father\u2019s good pleasure to give you the kingdom!","Sell what you possess and give donations to the poor; provide yourselves with purses and handbags that do not grow old
 an unfailing and inexhaustible treasure in the heavens
 where no thief comes near and no moth destroys.","For where your treasure is
 there will your heart be also.","Keep your loins girded and your lamps burning
","And be like men who are waiting for their master to return home from the marriage feast
 so that when he returns from the wedding and comes and knocks
 they may open to him immediately.","Blessed (happy
 fortunate
 and to be envied) are those servants whom the master finds awake and alert and watching when he comes. Truly I say to you
 he will gird himself and have them recline at table and will come and serve them!","If he comes in the second watch (before midnight) or the third watch (after midnight)
 and finds them so
 blessed (happy
 fortunate
 and to be envied) are those servants!","But of this be assured: if the householder had known at what time the burglar was coming
 he would have been awake and alert and watching and would not have permitted his house to be dug through and broken into.","You also must be ready
 for the Son of Man is coming at an hour and a moment when you do not anticipate it.","And the Lord said
 Who then is that faithful steward
 the wise man whom his master will set over those in his household service to supply them their allowance of food at the appointed time?","Blessed (happy and to be envied) is that servant whom his master finds so doing when he arrives.","Truly I tell you
 he will set him in charge over all his possessions.","But if that servant says in his heart
 My master is late in coming
 and begins to strike the menservants and the maids and to eat and drink and get drunk
","The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour of which he does not know
 and will punish him and cut him off and assign his lot with the unfaithful.","And that servant who knew his master\u2019s will but did not get ready or act as he would wish him to act shall be beaten with many [lashes].","But he who did not know and did things worthy of a beating shall be beaten with few [lashes]. For everyone to whom much is given
 of him shall much be required; and of him to whom men entrust much
 they will require and demand all the more.","I have come to cast fire upon the earth
 and how I wish that it were already kindled!","I have a baptism with which to be baptized
 and how greatly and sorely I am urged on (impelled
 constrained) until it is accomplished!","Do you suppose that I have come to give peace upon earth? No
 I say to you
 but rather division;","For from now on in one house there will be five divided [among themselves]
 three against two and two against three.","They will be divided
 father against son and son against father
 mother against daughter and daughter against mother
 mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.","He also said to the crowds of people
 When you see a cloud rising in the west
 at once you say
 It is going to rain! And so it does.","And when [you see that] a south wind is blowing
 you say
 There will be severe heat! And it occurs.","You playactors (hypocrites)! You know how [intelligently] to discern and interpret and prove the looks of the earth and sky; but how is it that you do not know how to discern and interpret and apply the proof to this present time?","And why do you not judge what is just and personally decide what is right?","Then as you go with your accuser before a magistrate
 on the way make a diligent effort to settle and be quit (free) of him
 lest he drag you to the judge
 and the judge turn you over to the officer
 and the officer put you in prison.","I tell you
 you will never get out until you have paid the very last [fraction of a] cent.","And He replied by saying to them
 Do you think that these Galileans were greater sinners than all the other Galileans because they have suffered in this way?","I tell you
 No; but unless you repent (change your mind for the better and heartily amend your ways
 with abhorrence of your past sins)
 you will all likewise perish and be lost eternally.","Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them\u2014do you think that they were more guilty offenders (debtors) than all the others who dwelt in Jerusalem?","I tell you
 No; but unless you repent (change your mind for the better and heartily amend your ways
 with abhorrence of your past sins)
 you will all likewise perish and be lost eternally.","And He told them this parable: A certain man had a fig tree
 planted in his vineyard
 and he came looking for fruit on it
 but did not find [any].","So he said to the vinedresser
 See here! For these three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree and I find none. Cut it down! Why should it continue also to use up the ground [to deplete the soil
 intercept the sun
 and take up room]?","But he replied to him
 Leave it alone
 sir
 [just] this one more year
 till I dig around it and put manure [on the soil].","Then perhaps it will bear fruit after this; but if not
 you can cut it down and out.","And when Jesus saw her
 He called [her to Him] and said to her
 Woman
 you are released from your infirmity!","But the Lord replied to him
 saying
 You playactors (hypocrites)! Does not each one of you on the Sabbath loose his ox or his donkey from the stall and lead it out to water it?","And ought not this woman
 a daughter of Abraham
 whom Satan has kept bound for eighteen years
 be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath day?","This led Him to say
 What is the kingdom of God like? And to what shall I compare it?","It is like a grain of mustard seed
 which a man took and planted in his own garden; and it grew and became a tree
 and the wild birds found shelter and roosted and nested in its branches.","And again He said
 To what shall I liken the kingdom of God?","It is like leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of wheat flour or meal until it was all leavened (fermented).","And someone asked Him
 Lord
 will only a few be saved (rescued
 delivered from the penalties of the last judgment
 and made partakers of the salvation by Christ)? And He said to them
","Strive to enter by the narrow door [force yourselves through it]
 for many
 I tell you
 will try to enter and will not be able.","When once the Master of the house gets up and closes the door
 and you begin to stand outside and to knock at the door [again and again]
 saying
 Lord
 open to us! He will answer you
 I do not know where [what household\u2014certainly not Mine] you come from.","Then you will begin to say
 We ate and drank in Your presence
 and You taught in our streets.","But He will say
 I tell you
 I do not know where [what household\u2014certainly not Mine] you come from; depart from Me
 all you wrongdoers!","There will be weeping and grinding of teeth when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God
 but you yourselves being cast forth (banished
 driven away).","And [people] will come from east and west
 and from north and south
 and sit down (feast at table) in the kingdom of God.","And behold
 there are some [now] last who will be first [then]
 and there are some [now] first who will be last [then].","And He said to them
 Go and tell that fox [sly and crafty
 skulking and cowardly]
 Behold
 I drive out demons and perform healings today and tomorrow
 and on the third day I finish (complete) My course.","Nevertheless
 I must continue on My way today and tomorrow and the day after that\u2014for it will never do for a prophet to be destroyed away from Jerusalem!","O Jerusalem
 Jerusalem
 you who continue to kill the prophets and to stone those who are sent to you! How often I have desired and yearned to gather your children together [around Me]
 as a hen [gathers] her young under her wings
 but you would not!","Behold
 your house is forsaken (abandoned
 left to you destitute of God\u2019s help)! And I tell you
 you will not see Me again until the time comes when you shall say
 Blessed (to be celebrated with praises) is He Who comes in the name of the Lord!","And Jesus asked the lawyers and the Pharisees
 Is it lawful and right to cure on the Sabbath or not?","And He said to them
 Which of you
 having a son or a donkey or an ox that has fallen into a well
 will not at once pull him out on the Sabbath day?","When you are invited by anyone to a marriage feast
 do not recline on the chief seat [in the place of honor]
 lest a more distinguished person than you has been invited by him
","And he who invited both of you will come to you and say
 Let this man have the place [you have taken]. Then
 with humiliation and a guilty sense of impropriety
 you will begin to take the lowest place.","But when you are invited
 go and recline in the lowest place
 so that when your host comes in
 he may say to you
 Friend
 go up higher! Then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit [at table] with you.","For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled (ranked below others who are honored or rewarded)
 and he who humbles himself (keeps a modest opinion of himself and behaves accordingly) will be exalted (elevated in rank).","Jesus also said to the man who had invited Him
 When you give a dinner or a supper
 do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or your wealthy neighbors
 lest perhaps they also invite you in return
 and so you are paid back.","But when you give a banquet or a reception
 invite the poor
 the disabled
 the lame
 and the blind.","Then you will be blessed (happy
 fortunate
 and to be envied)
 because they have no way of repaying you
 and you will be recompensed at the resurrection of the just (upright).","When one of those who reclined [at the table] with Him heard this
 he said to Him
 Blessed (happy
 fortunate
 and to be envied) is he who shall eat bread in the kingdom of God!","But Jesus said to him
 A man was once giving a great supper and invited many;","And at the hour for the supper he sent his servant to say to those who had been invited
 Come
 for all is now ready.","But they all alike began to make excuses and to beg off. The first said to him
 I have bought a piece of land
 and I have to go out and see it; I beg you
 have me excused.","And another said
 I have bought five yoke of oxen
 and I am going to examine and put my approval on them; I beg you
 have me excused.","And another said
 I have married a wife
 and because of this I am unable to come.","So the servant came and reported these [answers] to his master. Then the master of the house said in wrath to his servant
 Go quickly into the great streets and the small streets of the city and bring in here the poor and the disabled and the blind and the lame.","And the servant [returning] said
 Sir
 what you have commanded me to do has been done
 and yet there is room.","Then the master said to the servant
 Go out into the highways and hedges and urge and constrain [them] to yield and come in
 so that my house may be filled.","For I tell you
 not one of those who were invited shall taste my supper.","Now huge crowds were going along with [Jesus]
 and He turned and said to them
","If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his [own] father and mother [in the sense of indifference to or relative disregard for them in comparison with his attitude toward God] and [likewise] his wife and children and brothers and sisters\u2014[yes] and even his own life also\u2014he cannot be My disciple.","Whoever does not persevere and carry his own cross and come after (follow) Me cannot be My disciple.","For which of you
 wishing to build a farm building
 does not first sit down and calculate the cost [to see] whether he has sufficient means to finish it?","Otherwise
 when he has laid the foundation and is unable to complete [the building]
 all who see it will begin to mock and jeer at him
","Saying
 This man began to build and was not able (worth enough) to finish.","Or what king
 going out to engage in conflict with another king
 will not first sit down and consider and take counsel whether he is able with ten thousand [men] to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand?","And if he cannot [do so]
 when the other king is still a great way off
 he sends an envoy and asks the terms of peace.","So then
 any of you who does not forsake (renounce
 surrender claim to
 give up
 say good-bye to) all that he has cannot be My disciple.","Salt is good [an excellent thing]
 but if salt has lost its strength and has become saltless (insipid
 flat)
 how shall its saltness be restored?","It is fit neither for the land nor for the manure heap; men throw it away. He who has ears to hear
 let him listen and consider and comprehend by hearing!","What man of you
 if he has a hundred sheep and should lose one of them
 does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness (desert) and go after the one that is lost until he finds it?","And when he has found it
 he lays it on his [own] shoulders
 rejoicing.","And when he gets home
 he summons together [his] friends and [his] neighbors
 saying to them
 Rejoice with me
 because I have found my sheep which was lost.","Thus
 I tell you
 there will be more joy in heaven over one [especially] wicked person who repents (changes his mind
 abhorring his errors and misdeeds
 and determines to enter upon a better course of life) than over ninety-nine righteous persons who have no need of repentance.","Or what woman
 having ten [silver] drachmas [each one equal to a day\u2019s wages]
 if she loses one coin
 does not light a lamp and sweep the house and look carefully and diligently until she finds it?","And when she has found it
 she summons her [women] friends and neighbors
 saying
 Rejoice with me
 for I have found the silver coin which I had lost.","Even so
 I tell you
 there is joy among and in the presence of the angels of God over one [especially] wicked person who repents (changes his mind for the better
 heartily amending his ways
 with abhorrence of his past sins).","And He said
 There was a certain man who had two sons;","And the younger of them said to his father
 Father
 give me the part of the property that falls [to me]. And he divided the estate between them.","And not many days after that
 the younger son gathered up all that he had and journeyed into a distant country
 and there he wasted his fortune in reckless and loose [from restraint] living.","And when he had spent all he had
 a mighty famine came upon that country
 and he began to fall behind and be in want.","So he went and forced (glued) himself upon one of the citizens of that country
 who sent him into his fields to feed hogs.","And he would gladly have fed on and filled his belly with the carob pods that the hogs were eating
 but [they could not satisfy his hunger and] nobody gave him anything [better].","Then when he came to himself
 he said
 How many hired servants of my father have enough food
 and [even food] to spare
 but I am perishing (dying) here of hunger!","I will get up and go to my father
 and I will say to him
 Father
 I have sinned against heaven and in your sight.","I am no longer worthy to be called your son; [just] make me like one of your hired servants.","So he got up and came to his [own] father. But while he was still a long way off
 his father saw him and was moved with pity and tenderness [for him]; and he ran and embraced him and kissed him [fervently].","And the son said to him
 Father
 I have sinned against heaven and in your sight; I am no longer worthy to be called your son [I no longer deserve to be recognized as a son of yours]!","But the father said to his bond servants
 Bring quickly the best robe (the festive robe of honor) and put it on him; and give him a ring for his hand and sandals for his feet.","And bring out that [wheat-]fattened calf and kill it; and let us revel and feast and be happy and make merry
","Because this my son was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found! And they began to revel and feast and make merry.","But his older son was in the field; and as he returned and came near the house
 he heard music and dancing.","And having called one of the servant [boys] to him
 he began to ask what this meant.","And he said to him
 Your brother has come
 and your father has killed that [wheat-]fattened calf
 because he has received him back safe and well.","But [the elder brother] was angry [with deep-seated wrath] and resolved not to go in. Then his father came out and began to plead with him
","But he answered his father
 Look! These many years I have served you
 and I have never disobeyed your command. Yet you never gave me [so much as] a [little] kid
 that I might revel and feast and be happy and make merry with my friends;","But when this son of yours arrived
 who has devoured your estate with immoral women
 you have killed for him that [wheat-] fattened calf!","And the father said to him
 Son
 you are always with me
 and all that is mine is yours.","But it was fitting to make merry
 to revel and feast and rejoice
 for this brother of yours was dead and is alive again! He was lost and is found!","Also [Jesus] said to the disciples
 There was a certain rich man who had a manager of his estate
 and accusations [against this man] were brought to him
 that he was squandering his [master\u2019s] possessions.","And he called him and said to him
 What is this that I hear about you? Turn in the account of your management [of my affairs]
 for you can be [my] manager no longer.","And the manager of the estate said to himself
 What shall I do
 seeing that my master is taking the management away from me? I am not able to dig
 and I am ashamed to beg.","I have come to know what I will do
 so that they [my master\u2019s debtors] may accept and welcome me into their houses when I am put out of the management.","So he summoned his master\u2019s debtors one by one
 and he said to the first
 How much do you owe my master?","He said
 A hundred measures [about 900 gallons] of oil. And he said to him
 Take back your written acknowledgement of obligation
 and sit down quickly and write fifty [about 450 gallons].","After that he said to another
 And how much do you owe? He said
 A hundred measures [about 900 bushels] of wheat. He said to him
 Take back your written acknowledgement of obligation
 and write eighty [about 700 bushels].","And [his] master praised the dishonest (unjust) manager for acting shrewdly and prudently; for the sons of this age are shrewder and more prudent and wiser in [relation to] their own generation [to their own age and kind] than are the sons of light.","And I tell you
 make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous mammon (deceitful riches
 money
 possessions)
 so that when it fails
 they [those you have favored] may receive and welcome you into the everlasting habitations (dwellings).","He who is faithful in a very little [thing] is faithful also in much
 and he who is dishonest and unjust in a very little [thing] is dishonest and unjust also in much.","Therefore if you have not been faithful in the [case of] unrighteous mammon (deceitful riches
 money
 possessions)
 who will entrust to you the true riches?","And if you have not proved faithful in that which belongs to another [whether God or man]
 who will give you that which is your own [that is
 the true riches]?","No servant is able to serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other
 or he will stand by and be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon (riches
 or anything in which you trust and on which you rely).","But He said to them
 You are the ones who declare yourselves just and upright before men
 but God knows your hearts. For what is exalted and highly thought of among men is detestable and abhorrent (an abomination) in the sight of God.","Until John came
 there were the Law and the Prophets; since then the good news (the Gospel) of the kingdom of God is being preached
 and everyone strives violently to go in [would force his own way rather than God\u2019s way into it].","Yet it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one dot of the Law to fail and become void.","Whoever divorces (dismisses and repudiates) his wife and marries another commits adultery
 and he who marries a woman who is divorced from her husband commits adultery.","There was a certain rich man who [habitually] clothed himself in purple and fine linen and reveled and feasted and made merry in splendor every day.","And at his gate there was [carelessly] dropped down and left a certain utterly destitute man named Lazarus
 [reduced to begging alms and] covered with [ulcerated] sores.","He [eagerly] desired to be satisfied with what fell from the rich man\u2019s table; moreover
 the dogs even came and licked his sores.","And it occurred that the man [reduced to] begging died and was carried by the angels to Abraham\u2019s bosom. The rich man also died and was buried.","And in Hades (the realm of the dead)
 being in torment
 he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham far away
 and Lazarus in his bosom.","And he cried out and said
 Father Abraham
 have pity and mercy on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue
 for I am in anguish in this flame.","But Abraham said
 Child
 remember that you in your lifetime fully received [what is due you in] comforts and delights
 and Lazarus in like manner the discomforts and distresses; but now he is comforted here and you are in anguish.","And besides all this
 between us and you a great chasm has been fixed
 in order that those who want to pass from this [place] to you may not be able
 and no one may pass from there to us.","And [the man] said
 Then
 father
 I beseech you to send him to my father\u2019s house\u2014","For I have five brothers\u2014so that he may give [solemn] testimony and warn them
 lest they too come into this place of torment.","But Abraham said
 They have Moses and the Prophets; let them hear and listen to them.","But he answered
 No
 father Abraham
 but if someone from the dead goes to them
 they will repent (change their minds for the better and heartily amend their ways
 with abhorrence of their past sins).","He said to him
 If they do not hear and listen to Moses and the Prophets
 neither will they be persuaded and convinced and believe [even] if someone should rise from the dead.","And [Jesus] said to His disciples
 Temptations (snares
 traps set to entice to sin) are sure to come
 but woe to him by or through whom they come!","It would be more profitable for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were hurled into the sea than that he should cause to sin or be a snare to one of these little ones [lowly in rank or influence].","Pay attention and always be on your guard [looking out for one another]. If your brother sins (misses the mark)
 solemnly tell him so and reprove him
 and if he repents (feels sorry for having sinned)
 forgive him.","And even if he sins against you seven times in a day
 and turns to you seven times and says
 I repent [I am sorry]
 you must forgive him (give up resentment and consider the offense as recalled and annulled).","And the Lord answered
 If you had faith (trust and confidence in God) even [so small] like a grain of mustard seed
 you could say to this mulberry tree
 Be pulled up by the roots
 and be planted in the sea
 and it would obey you.","Will any man of you who has a servant plowing or tending sheep say to him when he has come in from the field
 Come at once and take your place at the table?","Will he not instead tell him
 Get my supper ready and gird yourself and serve me while I eat and drink; then afterward you yourself shall eat and drink?","Is he grateful and does he praise the servant because he did what he was ordered to do?","Even so on your part
 when you have done everything that was assigned and commanded you
 say
 We are unworthy servants [possessing no merit
 for we have not gone beyond our obligation]; we have [merely] done what was our duty to do.","As He went on His way to Jerusalem
 it occurred that [Jesus] was passing [along the border] between Samaria and Galilee.","And when He saw them
 He said to them
 Go [at once] and show yourselves to the priests. And as they went
 they were cured and made clean.","Then Jesus asked
 Were not [all] ten cleansed? Where are the nine?","Was there no one found to return and to recognize and give thanks and praise to God except this alien?","And He said to him
 Get up and go on your way. Your faith (your trust and confidence that spring from your belief in God) has restored you to health.","Asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come
 He replied to them by saying
 The kingdom of God does not come with signs to be observed or with visible display
","Nor will people say
 Look! Here [it is]! or
 See
 [it is] there! For behold
 the kingdom of God is within you [in your hearts] and among you [surrounding you].","And He said to the disciples
 The time is coming when you will long to see [even] one of the days of the Son of Man
 and you will not see [it].","And they will say to you
 Look! [He is] there! or
 Look! [He is] here! But do not go out or follow [them].","For like the lightning
 that flashes and lights up the sky from one end to the other
 so will the Son of Man be in His [own] day.","But first He must suffer many things and be disapproved and repudiated and rejected by this age and generation.","And [just] as it was in the days of Noah
 so will it be in the time of the Son of Man.","[People] ate
 they drank
 they married
 they were given in marriage
 right up to the day when Noah went into the ark
 and the flood came and destroyed them all.","So also [it was the same] as it was in the days of Lot. [People] ate
 they drank
 they bought
 they sold
 they planted
 they built;","But on the [very] day that Lot went out of Sodom
 it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed [them] all.","That is the way it will be on the day that the Son of Man is revealed.","On that day let him who is on the housetop
 with his belongings in the house
 not come down [and go inside] to carry them away; and likewise let him who is in the field not turn back.","Remember Lot\u2019s wife!","Whoever tries to preserve his life will lose it
 but whoever loses his life will preserve and quicken it.","I tell you
 in that night there will be two men in one bed; one will be taken and the other will be left.","There will be two women grinding together; one will be taken and the other will be left.","Then they asked Him
 Where
 Lord? He said to them
 Wherever the dead body is
 there will the vultures or eagles be gathered together.","He said
 In a certain city there was a judge who neither reverenced and feared God nor respected or considered man.","And there was a widow in that city who kept coming to him and saying
 Protect and defend and give me justice against my adversary.","And for a time he would not; but later he said to himself
 Though I have neither reverence or fear for God nor respect or consideration for man
","Yet because this widow continues to bother me
 I will defend and protect and avenge her
 lest she give me intolerable annoyance and wear me out by her continual coming or at the last she come and rail on me or assault me or strangle me.","Then the Lord said
 Listen to what the unjust judge says!","And will not [our just] God defend and protect and avenge His elect (His chosen ones)
 who cry to Him day and night? Will He defer them and delay help on their behalf?","I tell you
 He will defend and protect and avenge them speedily. However
 when the Son of Man comes
 will He find [persistence in] faith on the earth?","Two men went up into the temple [enclosure] to pray
 the one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.","The Pharisee took his stand ostentatiously and began to pray thus before and with himself: God
 I thank You that I am not like the rest of men\u2014extortioners (robbers)
 swindlers [unrighteous in heart and life]
 adulterers\u2014or even like this tax collector here.","I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I gain.","But the tax collector
 [merely] standing at a distance
 would not even lift up his eyes to heaven
 but kept striking his breast
 saying
 O God
 be favorable (be gracious
 be merciful) to me
 the especially wicked sinner that I am!","I tell you
 this man went down to his home justified (forgiven and made upright and in right standing with God)
 rather than the other man; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled
 but he who humbles himself will be exalted.","But Jesus called them [the parents] to Him
 saying
 Allow the little children to come to Me
 and do not hinder them
 for to such [as these] belongs the kingdom of God.","Truly I say to you
 whoever does not accept and receive and welcome the kingdom of God like a little child [does] shall not in any way enter it [at all].","Jesus said to him
 Why do you call Me [essentially and perfectly morally] good? No one is [essentially and perfectly morally] good\u2014except God only.","You know the commandments: Do not commit adultery
 do not kill
 do not steal
 do not witness falsely
 honor your father and your mother.","And he replied
 All these I have kept from my youth.","And when Jesus heard it
 He said to him
 One thing you still lack. Sell everything that you have and divide [the money] among the poor
 and you will have [rich] treasure in heaven; and come back [and] follow Me [become My disciple
 join My party
 and accompany Me].","Jesus
 observing him
 said
 How difficult it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God!","For it is easier for a camel to enter through a needle\u2019s eye than [for] a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.","But He said
 What is impossible with men is possible with God.","And He said to them
 I say to you truly
 there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God","Who will not receive in return many times more in this world and
 in the coming age
 eternal life.","Then taking the Twelve [apostles] aside
 He said to them
 Listen! We are going up to Jerusalem
 and all things that are written about the Son of Man through and by the prophets will be fulfilled.","For He will be handed over to the Gentiles and will be made sport of and scoffed and jeered at and insulted and spit upon.","They will flog Him and kill Him; and on the third day He will rise again.","But they understood nothing of these things; His words were a mystery and hidden from them
 and they did not comprehend what He was telling them.","What do you want Me to do for you? He said
 Lord
 let me receive my sight!","And Jesus said to him
 Receive your sight! Your faith (your trust and confidence that spring from your faith in God) has healed you.","And when Jesus reached the place
 He looked up and said to him
 Zacchaeus
 hurry and come down; for I must stay at your house today.","So then Zacchaeus stood up and solemnly declared to the Lord
 See
 Lord
 the half of my goods I [now] give [by way of restoration] to the poor
 and if I have cheated anyone out of anything
 I [now] restore four times as much.","And Jesus said to him
 Today is [Messianic and spiritual] salvation come to [all the members of] this household
 since Zacchaeus too is a [real spiritual] son of Abraham;","For the Son of Man came to seek and to save that which was lost.","He therefore said
 A certain nobleman went into a distant country to obtain for himself a kingdom and then to return.","Calling ten of his [own] bond servants
 he gave them ten minas [each equal to about one hundred days\u2019 wages or nearly twenty dollars] and said to them
 Buy and sell with these while I go and then return.","But his citizens detested him and sent an embassy after him to say
 We do not want this man to become ruler over us.","When he returned after having received the kingdom
 he ordered these bond servants to whom he had given the money to be called to him
 that he might know how much each one had made by buying and selling.","The first one came before him
 and he said
 Lord
 your mina has made ten [additional] minas.","And he said to him
 Well done
 excellent bond servant! Because you have been faithful and trustworthy in a very little [thing]
 you shall have authority over ten cities.","The second one also came and said
 Lord
 your mina has made five more minas.","And he said also to him
 And you will take charge over five cities.","Then another came and said
 Lord
 here is your mina
 which I have kept laid up in a handkerchief.","For I was [constantly] afraid of you
 because you are a stern (hard
 severe) man; you pick up what you did not lay down
 and you reap what you did not sow.","He said to the servant
 I will judge and condemn you out of your own mouth
 you wicked slave! You knew [did you] that I was a stern (hard
 severe) man
 picking up what I did not lay down
 and reaping what I did not sow?","Then why did you not put my money in a bank
 so that on my return
 I might have collected it with interest?","And he said to the bystanders
 Take the mina away from him and give it to him who has the ten minas.","And they said to him
 Lord
 he has ten minas [already]!","And [said Jesus
] I tell you that to everyone who gets and has will more be given
 but from the man who does not get and does not have
 even what he has will be taken away.","[The indignant king ended by saying] But as for these enemies of mine who did not want me to reign over them\u2014bring them here and slaughter them in my presence!","Telling [them]
 Go into the village yonder; there
 as you go in
 you will find a donkey\u2019s colt tied
 on which no man has ever yet sat. Loose it and bring [it here].","If anybody asks you
 Why are you untying [it]? you shall say this: Because the Lord has need of it.","And some of the Pharisees from the throng said to Jesus
 Teacher
 reprove Your disciples!","He replied
 I tell you that if these keep silent
 the very stones will cry out.","Exclaiming
 Would that you had known personally
 even at least in this your day
 the things that make for peace (for freedom from all the distresses that are experienced as the result of sin and upon which your peace\u2014your security
 safety
 prosperity
 and happiness\u2014depends)! But now they are hidden from your eyes.","For a time is coming upon you when your enemies will throw up a bank [with pointed stakes] about you and surround you and shut you in on every side.","And they will dash you down to the ground
 you [Jerusalem] and your children within you; and they will not leave in you one stone upon another
 [all] because you did not come progressively to recognize and know and understand [from observation and experience] the time of your visitation [that is
 when God was visiting you
 the time in which God showed Himself gracious toward you and offered you salvation through Christ].","Telling them
 It is written
 My house shall be a house of prayer; but you have made it a cave of robbers.","He replied to them
 I will also ask you a question. Now answer Me:","Was the baptism of John from heaven
 or from men?","Then Jesus said to them
 Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.","Then He began to relate to the people this parable (this story to figuratively portray what He had to say): A man planted a vineyard and leased it to some vinedressers and went into another country for a long stay.","When the [right] season came
 he sent a bond servant to the tenants
 that they might give him [his part] of the fruit of the vineyard; but the tenants beat (thrashed) him and sent him away empty-handed.","And he sent still another servant; him they also beat (thrashed) and dishonored and insulted him disgracefully and sent him away empty-handed.","And he sent yet a third; this one they wounded and threw out [of the vineyard].","Then the owner of the vineyard said
 What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; it is probable that they will respect him.","But when the tenants saw him
 they argued among themselves
 saying
 This is the heir; let us kill him
 so that the inheritance may be ours.","So they drove him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?","He will come and [utterly] put an end to those tenants and will give the vineyard to others. When they [the chief priests and the scribes and the elders] heard this
 they said
 May it never be!","But [Jesus] looked at them and said
 What then is [the meaning of] this that is written: The [very] Stone which the builders rejected has become the chief Stone of the corner [Cornerstone]?","Everyone who falls on that Stone will be broken [in pieces]; but upon whomever It falls
 It will crush him [winnow him and scatter him as dust].","So they watched [for an opportunity to ensnare] Him
 and sent spies who pretended to be upright (honest and sincere)
 that they might lay hold of something He might say
 so as to turn Him over to the control and authority of the governor.","Show Me a denarius (a coin)! Whose image and inscription does it have? They answered
 Caesar\u2019s.","He said to them
 Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar\u2019s
 and to God the things that are God\u2019s.","So they could not in the presence of the people take hold of anything He said to turn it against Him; but marveling at His reply
 they were silent.","And Jesus said to them
 The people of this world and present age marry and are given in marriage;","But those who are considered worthy to gain that other world and that future age and to attain to the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage;","For they cannot die again
 but they are angel-like and equal to angels. And being sons of and sharers in the resurrection
 they are sons of God.","But that the dead are raised [from death]\u2014even Moses made known and showed in the passage concerning the [burning] bush
 where he calls the Lord
 The God of Abraham
 the God of Isaac
 and the God of Jacob.","Now He is not the God of the dead
 but of the living
 for to Him all men are alive [whether in the body or out of it] and they are alive [not dead] unto Him [in definite relationship to Him].","But He asked them
 How can people say that the Christ (the Messiah
 the Anointed One) is David\u2019s Son?","For David himself says in [the] Book of Psalms
 The Lord said to my Lord
 Sit at My right hand","Until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet.","So David calls Him Lord; how then is He his Son?","Beware of the scribes
 who like to walk about in long robes and love to be saluted [with honor] in places where people congregate and love the front and best seats in the synagogues and places of distinction at feasts
","Who make away with and devour widows\u2019 houses
 and [to cover it up] with pretense make long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation (the heavier sentence
 the severer punishment).","And He said
 Truly I say to you
 this poor widow has put in more than all of them;","For they all gave out of their abundance (their surplus); but she has contributed out of her lack and her want
 putting in all that she had on which to live.","As for all this that you [thoughtfully] look at
 the time will come when there shall not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down.","And He said
 Be on your guard and be careful that you are not led astray; for many will come in My name [appropriating to themselves the name Messiah which belongs to Me]
 saying
 I am He! and
 The time is at hand! Do not go out after them.","And when you hear of wars and insurrections (disturbances
 disorder
 and confusion)
 do not become alarmed and panic-stricken and terrified; for all this must take place first
 but the end will not [come] immediately.","Then He told them
 Nation will rise against nation
 and kingdom against kingdom.","There will be mighty and violent earthquakes
 and in various places famines and pestilences (plagues: malignant and contagious or infectious epidemic diseases which are deadly and devastating); and there will be sights of terror and great signs from heaven.","But previous to all this
 they will lay their hands on you and persecute you
 turning you over to the synagogues and prisons
 and you will be led away before kings and governors for My name\u2019s sake.","This will be a time (an opportunity) for you to bear testimony.","Resolve and settle it in your minds not to meditate and prepare beforehand how you are to make your defense and how you will answer.","For I [Myself] will give you a mouth and such utterance and wisdom that all of your foes combined will be unable to stand against or refute.","You will be delivered up and betrayed even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends
 and [some] of you they will put to death.","And you will be hated (despised) by everyone because [you bear] My name and for its sake.","But not a hair of your head shall perish.","By your steadfastness and patient endurance you shall win the true life of your souls.","But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies
 then know and understand that its desolation has come near.","Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains
 and let those who are inside [the city] get out of it
 and let not those who are out in the country come into it;","For those are days of vengeance [of rendering full justice or satisfaction]
 that all things that are written may be fulfilled.","Alas for those who are pregnant and for those who have babies which they are nursing in those days! For great misery and anguish and distress shall be upon the land and indignation and punishment and retribution upon this people.","They will fall by the mouth and the edge of the sword and will be led away as captives to and among all nations; and Jerusalem will be trodden down by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled (completed).","And there will be signs in the sun and moon and stars; and upon the earth [there will be] distress (trouble and anguish) of nations in bewilderment and perplexity [without resources
 left wanting
 embarrassed
 in doubt
 not knowing which way to turn] at the roaring (the echo) of the tossing of the sea
","Men swooning away or expiring with fear and dread and apprehension and expectation of the things that are coming on the world; for the [very] powers of the heavens will be shaken and caused to totter.","And then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with great (transcendent and overwhelming) power and [all His kingly] glory (majesty and splendor).","Now when these things begin to occur
 look up and lift up your heads
 because your redemption (deliverance) is drawing near.","And He told them a parable: Look at the fig tree and all the trees;","When they put forth their buds and come out in leaf
 you see for yourselves and perceive and know that summer is already near.","Even so
 when you see these things taking place
 understand and know that the kingdom of God is at hand.","Truly I tell you
 this generation (those living at that definite period of time) will not perish and pass away until all has taken place.","The sky and the earth (the universe
 the world) will pass away
 but My words will not pass away.","But take heed to yourselves and be on your guard
 lest your hearts be overburdened and depressed (weighed down) with the giddiness and headache and nausea of self-indulgence
 drunkenness
 and worldly worries and cares pertaining to [the business of] this life
 and [lest] that day come upon you suddenly like a trap or a noose;","For it will come upon all who live upon the face of the entire earth.","Keep awake then and watch at all times [be discreet
 attentive
 and ready]
 praying that you may have the full strength and ability and be accounted worthy to escape all these things [taken together] that will take place
 and to stand in the presence of the Son of Man.","So Jesus sent Peter and John
 saying
 Go and prepare for us the Passover meal
 that we may eat it.","He said to them
 Behold
 when you have gone into the city
 a man carrying an earthen jug or pitcher of water will meet you; follow him into the house which he enters
","And say to the master of the house
 The Teacher asks you
 Where is the guest room
 where I may eat the Passover [meal] with My disciples?","And he will show you a large room upstairs
 furnished [with carpets and with couches properly spread]; there make [your] preparations.","And He said to them
 I have earnestly and intensely desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer;","For I say to you
 I shall eat it no more until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.","And He took a cup
 and when He had given thanks
 He said
 Take this and divide and distribute it among yourselves;","For I say to you that from now on I shall not drink of the fruit of the vine at all until the kingdom of God comes.","Then He took a loaf [of bread]
 and when He had given thanks
 He broke [it] and gave it to them saying
 This is My body which is given for you; do this in remembrance of Me.","And in like manner
 He took the cup after supper
 saying
 This cup is the new testament or covenant [ratified] in My blood
 which is shed (poured out) for you.","But
 behold
 the hand of him who is now engaged in betraying Me is with Me on the table.","For the Son of Man is going as it has been determined and appointed
 but woe to that man by whom He is betrayed and delivered up!","But Jesus said to them
 The kings of the Gentiles are deified by them and exercise lordship [ruling as emperor-gods] over them; and those in authority over them are called benefactors and well-doers.","But this is not to be so with you; on the contrary
 let him who is the greatest among you become like the youngest
 and him who is the chief and leader like one who serves.","For who is the greater
 the one who reclines at table (the master)
 or the one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines at table? But I am in your midst as One Who serves.","And you are those who have remained [throughout] and persevered with Me in My trials;","And as My Father has appointed a kingdom and conferred it on Me
 so do I confer on you [the privilege and decree]
","That you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom and sit on thrones
 judging the twelve tribes of Israel.","Simon
 Simon (Peter)
 listen! Satan has asked excessively that [all of] you be given up to him [out of the power and keeping of God]
 that he might sift [all of] you like grain
","But I have prayed especially for you [Peter]
 that your [own] faith may not fail; and when you yourself have turned again
 strengthen and establish your brethren.","And [Simon Peter] said to Him
 Lord
 I am ready to go with You both to prison and to death.","But Jesus said
 I tell you
 Peter
 before a [single] cock shall crow this day
 you will three times [utterly] deny that you know Me.","And He said to them
 When I sent you out with no purse or [provision] bag or sandals
 did you lack anything? They answered
 Nothing!","Then He said to them
 But now let him who has a purse take it
 and also [his provision] bag; and let him who has no sword sell his mantle and buy a sword.","For I tell you that this Scripture must yet be fulfilled in Me: And He was counted and classed among the wicked (the outlaws
 the criminals); for what is written about Me has its fulfillment [has reached its end and is finally settled].","And they said
 Look
 Lord! Here are two swords. And He said to them
 It is enough.","And when He came to the place
 He said to them
 Pray that you may not [at all] enter into temptation.","Saying
 Father
 if You are willing
 remove this cup from Me; yet not My will
 but [always] Yours be done.","And He said to them
 Why do you sleep? Get up and pray that you may not enter [at all] into temptation.","But Jesus said to him
 Judas! Would you betray and deliver up the Son of Man with a kiss?","But Jesus said
 Permit them to go so far [as to seize Me]. And He touched the little (insignificant) ear and healed him.","Then Jesus said to those who had come out against Him\u2014the chief priests and captains of the temple and elders [of the Sanhedrin]\u2014Have you come out with swords and clubs as [you would] against a robber?","When I was with you day after day in the temple [enclosure]
 you did not stretch forth [your] hands against Me. But this is your hour\u2014and the power [which] darkness [gives you has its way].","And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter recalled the Lord\u2019s words
 how He had told him
 Before the cock crows today
 you will deny Me thrice.","If You are the Christ (the Messiah)
 tell us. But He said to them
 If I tell you
 you will not believe (trust in
 cleave to
 and rely on what I say)
","And if I question you
 you will not answer.","But hereafter (from this time on)
 the Son of Man shall be seated at the right hand of the power of God.","And they all said
 You are the Son of God
 then? And He said to them
 It is just as you say; I Am.","So Pilate asked Him
 Are You the King of the Jews? And He answered him
 [It is just as] you say. [I Am.]","Upon hearing this
 Pilate asked whether the Man was a Galilean.","And said to them
 You brought this Man before me as One Who was perverting and misleading and turning away and corrupting the people; and behold
 after examining Him before you
 I have not found any offense (crime or guilt) in this Man in regard to your accusations against Him;","A third time he said to them
 Why? What wrong has He done? I have found [no offense or crime or guilt] in Him nothing deserving of death; I will therefore chastise Him [in order to teach Him better] and release Him.","But Jesus
 turning toward them
 said
 Daughters of Jerusalem
 do not weep for Me
 but weep for yourselves and for your children.","For behold
 the days are coming during which they will say
 Blessed (happy
 fortunate
 and to be envied) are the barren
 and the wombs that have not borne
 and the breasts that have never nursed [babies]!","Then they will begin to say to the mountains
 Fall on us! and to the hills
 Cover (conceal
 hide) us!","For if they do these things when the timber is green
 what will happen when it is dry?","And Jesus prayed
 Father
 forgive them
 for they know not what they do. And they divided His garments and distributed them by casting lots for them.","And He answered him
 Truly I tell you
 today you shall be with Me in Paradise.","And Jesus
 crying out with a loud voice
 said
 Father
 into Your hands I commit My spirit! And with these words
 He expired.","And as [the women] were frightened and were bowing their faces to the ground
 the men said to them
 Why do you look for the living among [those who are] dead?","And He said to them
 What is this discussion that you are exchanging (throwing back and forth) between yourselves as you walk along? And they stood still
 looking sad and downcast.","And He said to them
 What [kind of] things? And they said to Him
 About Jesus of Nazareth
 Who was a Prophet mighty in work and word before God and all the people\u2014","And [Jesus] said to them
 O foolish ones [sluggish in mind
 dull of perception] and slow of heart to believe (adhere to and trust in and rely on) everything that the prophets have spoken!","Was it not necessary and essentially fitting that the Christ (the Messiah) should suffer all these things before entering into His glory (His majesty and splendor)?","Now while they were talking about this
 Jesus Himself took His stand among them and said to them
 Peace (freedom from all the distresses that are experienced as the result of sin) be to you!","And He said to them
 Why are you disturbed and troubled
 and why do such doubts and questionings arise in your hearts?","See My hands and My feet
 that it is I Myself! Feel and handle Me and see
 for a spirit does not have flesh and bones
 as you see that I have.","And while [since] they still could not believe it for sheer joy and marveled
 He said to them
 Have you anything here to eat?","Then He said to them
 This is what I told you while I was still with you: everything which is written concerning Me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled.","And said to them
 Thus it is written that the Christ (the Messiah) should suffer and on the third day rise from ( among) the dead
","And that repentance [with a view to and as the condition of] forgiveness of sins should be preached in His name to all nations
 beginning from Jerusalem.","You are witnesses of these things.","And behold
 I will send forth upon you what My Father has promised; but remain in the city [Jerusalem] until you are clothed with power from on high.","Jesus replied
 \u201cWhy were you looking for me? Didn\u2019t you know that it was necessary for me to be in my Father\u2019s house?\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cIt\u2019s written
 People won\u2019t live only by bread.\u201d","The devil said
 \u201cI will give you this whole domain and the glory of all these kingdoms. It\u2019s been entrusted to me and I can give it to anyone I want.","Jesus answered
 \u201cIt\u2019s written
 You will worship the Lord your God and serve only him.\u201d","The devil brought him into Jerusalem and stood him at the highest point of the temple. He said to him
 \u201cSince you are God\u2019s Son
 throw yourself down from here;","Jesus answered
 \u201cIt\u2019s been said
 Don\u2019t test the Lord your God.\u201d","The Spirit of the Lord is upon me
  because the Lord has anointed me. He has sent me to preach good news to the poor
  to proclaim release to the prisoners  and recovery of sight to the blind
  to liberate the oppressed
","and to proclaim the year of the Lord\u2019s favor.","He began to explain to them
 \u201cToday
 this scripture has been fulfilled just as you heard it.\u201d","Then Jesus said to them
 \u201cUndoubtedly
 you will quote this saying to me: \u2018Doctor
 heal yourself. Do here in your hometown what we\u2019ve heard you did in Capernaum.\u2019\u201d","He said
 \u201cI assure you that no prophet is welcome in the prophet\u2019s hometown.","And I can assure you that there were many widows in Israel during Elijah\u2019s time
 when it didn\u2019t rain for three and a half years and there was a great food shortage in the land.","Yet Elijah was sent to none of them but only to a widow in the city of Zarephath in the region of Sidon.","There were also many persons with skin diseases in Israel during the time of the prophet Elisha
 but none of them were cleansed. Instead
 Naaman the Syrian was cleansed.\u201d","They were amazed by his teaching because he delivered his message with authority.","\u201cSilence!\u201d Jesus said
 speaking harshly to the demon. \u201cCome out of him!\u201d The demon threw the man down before them
 then came out of him without harming him.","Demons also came out of many people. They screamed
 \u201cYou are God\u2019s Son.\u201d But he spoke harshly to them and wouldn\u2019t allow them to speak because they recognized that he was the Christ.","But he said to them
 \u201cI must preach the good news of God\u2019s kingdom in other cities too
 for this is why I was sent.\u201d","When he finished speaking to the crowds
 he said to Simon
 \u201cRow out farther
 into the deep water
 and drop your nets for a catch.\u201d","James and John
 Zebedee\u2019s sons
 were Simon\u2019s partners and they were amazed too. Jesus said to Simon
 \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. From now on
 you will be fishing for people.\u201d","Jesus reached out his hand
 touched him
 and said
 \u201cI do want to. Be clean.\u201d Instantly
 the skin disease left him.","Jesus ordered him not to tell anyone. \u201cInstead
\u201d Jesus said
 \u201cgo and show yourself to the priest and make an offering for your cleansing
 as Moses instructed. This will be a testimony to them.\u201d","When Jesus saw their faith
 he said
 \u201cFriend
 your sins are forgiven.\u201d","Jesus recognized what they were discussing and responded
 \u201cWhy do you fill your minds with these questions?","Which is easier\u2014to say
 \u2018Your sins are forgiven
\u2019 or to say
 \u2018Get up and walk\u2019?","But so that you will know that the Human One has authority on the earth to forgive sins\u201d \u2014Jesus now spoke to the man who was paralyzed
 \u201cI say to you
 get up
 take your cot
 and go home.\u201d","Afterward
 Jesus went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at a kiosk for collecting taxes. Jesus said to him
 \u201cFollow me.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cHealthy people don\u2019t need a doctor
 but sick people do.","I didn\u2019t come to call righteous people but sinners to change their hearts and lives.\u201d","Some people said to Jesus
 \u201cThe disciples of John fast often and pray frequently. The disciples of the Pharisees do the same
 but your disciples are always eating and drinking.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cYou can\u2019t make the wedding guests fast while the groom is with them
 can you?","The days will come when the groom will be taken from them
 and then they will fast.\u201d","Then he told them a parable. \u201cNo one tears a patch from a new garment to patch an old garment. Otherwise
 the new garment would be ruined
 and the new patch wouldn\u2019t match the old garment.","Nobody pours new wine into old wineskins. If they did
 the new wine would burst the wineskins
 the wine would spill
 and the wineskins would be ruined.","Instead
 new wine must be put into new wineskins.","No one who drinks a well-aged wine wants new wine
 but says
 \u2018The well-aged wine is better.\u2019\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cHaven\u2019t you read what David and his companions did when they were hungry?","He broke the Law by going into God\u2019s house and eating the bread of the presence
 which only the priests can eat. He also gave some of the bread to his companions.\u201d","Then he said to them
 \u201cThe Human One is Lord of the Sabbath.\u201d","Jesus knew their thoughts
 so he said to the man with the withered hand
 \u201cGet up and stand in front of everyone.\u201d He got up and stood there.","Jesus said to the legal experts and Pharisees
 \u201cHere\u2019s a question for you: Is it legal on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil
 to save life or to destroy it?\u201d","Looking around at them all
 he said to the man
 \u201cStretch out your hand.\u201d So he did and his hand was made healthy.","Happy are you who hunger now

 because you have already received your comfort.","How terrible for you who have plenty now
 because you will be hungry. How terrible for you who laugh now
 because you will mourn and weep.","How terrible for you when all speak well of you. Their ancestors did the same things to the false prophets.","\u201cBut I say to you who are willing to hear: Love your enemies. Do good to those who hate you.","Bless those who curse you. Pray for those who mistreat you.","If someone slaps you on the cheek
 offer the other one as well. If someone takes your coat
 don\u2019t withhold your shirt either.","Give to everyone who asks and don\u2019t demand your things back from those who take them.","Treat people in the same way that you want them to treat you.","\u201cIf you love those who love you
 why should you be commended? Even sinners love those who love them.","If you do good to those who do good to you
 why should you be commended? Even sinners do that.","If you lend to those from whom you expect repayment
 why should you be commended? Even sinners lend to sinners expecting to be paid back in full.","Instead
 love your enemies
 do good
 and lend expecting nothing in return. If you do
 you will have a great reward. You will be acting the way children of the Most High act

 and you won\u2019t be judged. Don\u2019t condemn

 and you will be forgiven.","Give
 and it will be given to you. A good portion\u2014packed down
 firmly shaken
 and overflowing\u2014will fall into your lap. The portion you give will determine the portion you receive in return.\u201d","Jesus also told them a riddle. \u201cA blind person can\u2019t lead another blind person

 and then you will see clearly to take the splinter out of your brother\u2019s or sister\u2019s eye.","\u201cA good tree doesn\u2019t produce bad fruit
 nor does a bad tree produce good fruit.","Each tree is known by its own fruit. People don\u2019t gather figs from thorny plants
 nor do they pick grapes from prickly bushes.","A good person produces good from the good treasury of the inner self
 while an evil person produces evil from the evil treasury of the inner self. The inner self overflows with words that are spoken.","\u201cWhy do you call me \u2018Lord
 Lord\u2019 and don\u2019t do what I say?","I\u2019ll show what it\u2019s like when someone comes to me
 hears my words
 and puts them into practice.","It\u2019s like a person building a house by digging deep and laying the foundation on bedrock. When the flood came
 the rising water smashed against that house
 but the water couldn\u2019t shake the house because it was well built.","But those who don\u2019t put into practice what they hear are like a person who built a house without a foundation. The floodwater smashed against it and it collapsed instantly. It was completely destroyed.\u201d","When Jesus heard these words
 he was impressed with the centurion. He turned to the crowd following him and said
 \u201cI tell you
 even in Israel I haven\u2019t found faith like this.\u201d","When he saw her
 the Lord had compassion for her and said
 \u201cDon\u2019t cry.\u201d","He stepped forward and touched the stretcher on which the dead man was being carried. Those carrying him stood still. Jesus said
 \u201cYoung man
 I say to you
 get up.\u201d","Then he replied to John\u2019s disciples
 \u201cGo
 report to John what you have seen and heard. Those who were blind are able to see. Those who were crippled now walk. People with skin diseases are cleansed. Those who were deaf now hear. Those who were dead are raised up. And good news is preached to the poor.","Happy is anyone who doesn\u2019t stumble along the way because of me.\u201d","After John\u2019s messengers were gone
 Jesus spoke to the crowds about John. \u201cWhat did you go out into the wilderness to see? A stalk blowing in the wind?","What did you go out to see? A man dressed up in refined clothes? Look
 those who dress in fashionable clothes and live in luxury are in royal palaces.","What did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes
 I tell you
 and more than a prophet.","He is the one of whom it\u2019s written: Look
 I\u2019m sending my messenger before you
 who will prepare your way before you.","I tell you that no greater human being has ever been born than John. Yet whoever is least in God\u2019s kingdom is greater than he.\u201d","\u201cTo what will I compare the people of this generation?\u201d Jesus asked. \u201cWhat are they like?","They are like children sitting in the marketplace calling out to each other
 \u2018We played the flute for you and you didn\u2019t dance. We sang a funeral song and you didn\u2019t cry.\u2019","John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine
 and you say
 \u2018He has a demon.\u2019","Yet the Human One came eating and drinking
 and you say
 \u2018Look
 a glutton and a drunk
 a friend of tax collectors and sinners.\u2019","But wisdom is proved to be right by all her descendants.\u201d","When the Pharisee who had invited Jesus saw what was happening
 he said to himself
 If this man were a prophet
 he would know what kind of woman is touching him. He would know that she is a sinner.","Jesus replied
 \u201cSimon
 I have something to say to you.\u201d \u201cTeacher
 speak
\u201d he said.","\u201cA certain lender had two debtors. One owed enough money to pay five hundred people for a day\u2019s work. The other owed enough money for fifty.","When they couldn\u2019t pay
 the lender forgave the debts of them both. Which of them will love him more?\u201d","Simon replied
 \u201cI suppose the one who had the largest debt canceled.\u201d Jesus said
 \u201cYou have judged correctly.\u201d","Jesus turned to the woman and said to Simon
 \u201cDo you see this woman? When I entered your home
 you didn\u2019t give me water for my feet
 but she wet my feet with tears and wiped them with her hair.","You didn\u2019t greet me with a kiss
 but she hasn\u2019t stopped kissing my feet since I came in.","You didn\u2019t anoint my head with oil
 but she has poured perfumed oil on my feet.","This is why I tell you that her many sins have been forgiven; so she has shown great love. The one who is forgiven little loves little.\u201d","Then Jesus said to her
 \u201cYour sins are forgiven.\u201d","Jesus said to the woman
 \u201cYour faith has saved you. Go in peace.\u201d","When a great crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from one city after another
 he spoke to them in a parable:","\u201cA farmer went out to scatter his seed. As he was scattering it
 some fell on the path where it was crushed
 and the birds in the sky came and ate it.","Other seed fell on rock. As it grew
 it dried up because it had no moisture.","Other seed fell among thorny plants. The thorns grew with the plants and choked them.","Still other seed landed on good soil. When it grew
 it produced one hundred times more grain than was scattered.\u201d As he said this
 he called out
 \u201cEveryone who has ears should pay attention.\u201d","He said
 \u201cYou have been given the mysteries of God\u2019s kingdom
 but these mysteries come to everyone else in parables so that when they see
 they can\u2019t see
 and when they hear
 they can\u2019t understand.","\u201cThe parable means this: The seed is God\u2019s word.","The seed on the path are those who hear
 but then the devil comes and steals the word from their hearts so that they won\u2019t believe and be saved.","The seed on the rock are those who receive the word joyfully when they hear it
 but they have no root. They believe for a while but fall away when they are tempted.","As for the seed that fell among thorny plants
 these are the ones who
 as they go about their lives
 are choked by the concerns
 riches
 and pleasures of life
 and their fruit never matures.","The seed that fell on good soil are those who hear the word and commit themselves to it with a good and upright heart. Through their resolve
 they bear fruit.","\u201cNo one lights a lamp and then covers it with a bowl or puts it under a bed. Instead
 they put it on top of a lampstand so that those who enter can see the light.","Nothing is hidden that won\u2019t be exposed. Nor is anything concealed that won\u2019t be made known and brought to the light.","Therefore
 listen carefully. Those who have will receive more
 but as for those who don\u2019t have
 even what they seem to have will be taken away from them.\u201d","Someone told him
 \u201cYour mother and brothers are standing outside
 wanting to see you.\u201d","He replied
 \u201cMy mother and brothers are those who listen to God\u2019s word and do it.\u201d","One day Jesus and his disciples boarded a boat. He said to them
 \u201cLet\u2019s cross over to the other side of the lake.\u201d So they set sail.","He said to his disciples
 \u201cWhere is your faith?\u201d Filled with awe and wonder
 they said to each other
 \u201cWho is this? He commands even the winds and the water
 and they obey him!\u201d","Jesus asked him
 \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d \u201cLegion
\u201d he replied
 because many demons had entered him.","\u201cReturn home and tell the story of what God has done for you.\u201d So he went throughout the city proclaiming what Jesus had done for him.","\u201cWho touched me?\u201d Jesus asked. When everyone denied it
 Peter said
 \u201cMaster
 the crowds are surrounding you and pressing in on you!\u201d","But Jesus said
 \u201cSomeone touched me. I know that power has gone out from me.\u201d","\u201cDaughter
 your faith has healed you
\u201d Jesus said. \u201cGo in peace.\u201d","When Jesus heard this
 he responded
 \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid; just keep trusting
 and she will be healed.\u201d","They were all crying and mourning for her
 but Jesus said
 \u201cDon\u2019t cry. She isn\u2019t dead. She\u2019s only sleeping.\u201d","Taking her hand
 Jesus called out
 \u201cChild
 get up.\u201d","He told them
 \u201cTake nothing for the journey\u2014no walking stick
 no bag
 no bread
 no money
 not even an extra shirt.","Whatever house you enter
 remain there until you leave that place.","Wherever they don\u2019t welcome you
 as you leave that city
 shake the dust off your feet as a witness against them.\u201d","He replied
 \u201cYou give them something to eat.\u201d But they said
 \u201cWe have no more than five loaves of bread and two fish\u2014unless we go and buy food for all these people.\u201d","(They said this because about five thousand men were present.) Jesus said to his disciples
 \u201cSeat them in groups of about fifty.\u201d","Once when Jesus was praying by himself
 the disciples joined him
 and he asked them
 \u201cWho do the crowds say that I am?\u201d","He asked them
 \u201cAnd what about you? Who do you say that I am?\u201d Peter answered
 \u201cThe Christ sent from God.\u201d","He said
 \u201cThe Human One must suffer many things and be rejected\u2014by the elders
 chief priests
 and the legal experts\u2014and be killed and be raised on the third day.\u201d","Jesus said to everyone
 \u201cAll who want to come after me must say no to themselves
 take up their cross daily
 and follow me.","All who want to save their lives will lose them. But all who lose their lives because of me will save them.","What advantage do people have if they gain the whole world for themselves yet perish or lose their lives?","Whoever is ashamed of me and my words
 the Human One will be ashamed of that person when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.","I assure you that some standing here won\u2019t die before they see God\u2019s kingdom.\u201d","As the two men were about to leave Jesus
 Peter said to him
 \u201cMaster
 it\u2019s good that we\u2019re here. We should construct three shrines: one for you
 one for Moses
 and one for Elijah\u201d\u2014but he didn\u2019t know what he was saying.","Jesus answered
 \u201cYou faithless and crooked generation
 how long will I be with you and put up with you? Bring your son here.\u201d","\u201cTake these words to heart: the Human One is about to be delivered into human hands.\u201d","Jesus said to his disciples
 \u201cWhoever welcomes this child in my name welcomes me. Whoever welcomes me
 welcomes the one who sent me. Whoever is least among you all is the greatest.\u201d","But Jesus replied
 \u201cDon\u2019t stop him
 because whoever isn\u2019t against you is for you.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cFoxes have dens and the birds in the sky have nests
 but the Human One has no place to lay his head.\u201d","Then Jesus said to someone else
 \u201cFollow me.\u201d He replied
 \u201cLord
 first let me go and bury my father.\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cLet the dead bury their own dead. But you go and spread the news of God\u2019s kingdom.\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cNo one who puts a hand on the plow and looks back is fit for God\u2019s kingdom.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cThe harvest is bigger than you can imagine
 but there are few workers. Therefore
 plead with the Lord of the harvest to send out workers for his harvest.","Go! Be warned
 though
 that I\u2019m sending you out as lambs among wolves.","Carry no wallet
 no bag
 and no sandals. Don\u2019t even greet anyone along the way.","Whenever you enter a house
 first say
 \u2018May peace be on this house.\u2019","If anyone there shares God\u2019s peace
 then your peace will rest on that person. If not
 your blessing will return to you.","Remain in this house
 eating and drinking whatever they set before you
 for workers deserve their pay. Don\u2019t move from house to house.","Whenever you enter a city and its people welcome you
 eat what they set before you.","Heal the sick who are there
 and say to them
 \u2018God\u2019s kingdom has come upon you.\u2019","Whenever you enter a city and the people don\u2019t welcome you
 go out into the streets and say
","\u2018As a complaint against you
 we brush off the dust of your city that has collected on our feet. But know this: God\u2019s kingdom has come to you.\u2019","I assure you that Sodom will be better off on Judgment Day than that city.","\u201cHow terrible it will be for you
 Chorazin. How terrible it will be for you
 Bethsaida. If the miracles done among you had been done in Tyre and Sidon
 they would have changed their hearts and lives long ago. They would have sat around in funeral clothes and ashes.","But Tyre and Sidon will be better off at the judgment than you.","And you
 Capernaum
 will you be honored by being raised up to heaven? No
 you will be cast down to the place of the dead.","Whoever listens to you listens to me. Whoever rejects you rejects me. Whoever rejects me rejects the one who sent me.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cI saw Satan fall from heaven like lightning.","Look
 I have given you authority to crush snakes and scorpions underfoot. I have given you authority over all the power of the enemy. Nothing will harm you.","Nevertheless
 don\u2019t rejoice because the spirits submit to you. Rejoice instead that your names are written in heaven.\u201d","At that very moment
 Jesus overflowed with joy from the Holy Spirit and said
 \u201cI praise you
 Father
 Lord of heaven and earth
 because you\u2019ve hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and shown them to babies. Indeed
 Father
 this brings you happiness.","My Father has handed all things over to me. No one knows who the Son is except the Father
 or who the Father is except the Son and anyone to whom the Son wants to reveal him.\u201d","Turning to the disciples
 he said privately
 \u201cHappy are the eyes that see what you see.","I assure you that many prophets and kings wanted to see what you see and hear what you hear
 but they didn\u2019t.\u201d","A legal expert stood up to test Jesus. \u201cTeacher
\u201d he said
 \u201cwhat must I do to gain eternal life?\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cWhat is written in the Law? How do you interpret it?\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cYou have answered correctly. Do this and you will live.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cA man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho. He encountered thieves
 who stripped him naked
 beat him up
 and left him near death.","Now it just so happened that a priest was also going down the same road. When he saw the injured man
 he crossed over to the other side of the road and went on his way.","Likewise
 a Levite came by that spot
 saw the injured man
 and crossed over to the other side of the road and went on his way.","A Samaritan
 who was on a journey
 came to where the man was. But when he saw him
 he was moved with compassion.","The Samaritan went to him and bandaged his wounds
 tending them with oil and wine. Then he placed the wounded man on his own donkey
 took him to an inn
 and took care of him.","The next day
 he took two full days\u2019 worth of wages and gave them to the innkeeper. He said
 \u2018Take care of him
 and when I return
 I will pay you back for any additional costs.\u2019","What do you think? Which one of these three was a neighbor to the man who encountered thieves?\u201d","Then the legal expert said
 \u201cThe one who demonstrated mercy toward him.\u201d Jesus told him
 \u201cGo and do likewise.\u201d","The Lord answered
 \u201cMartha
 Martha
 you are worried and distracted by many things.","One thing is necessary. Mary has chosen the better part. It won\u2019t be taken away from her.\u201d","Jesus was praying in a certain place. When he finished
 one of his disciples said
 \u201cLord
 teach us to pray
 just as John taught his disciples.\u201d","Jesus told them
 \u201cWhen you pray
 say: \u2018Father
 uphold the holiness of your name. Bring in your kingdom.","Give us the bread we need for today.","Forgive us our sins
 for we also forgive everyone who has wronged us. And don\u2019t lead us into temptation.\u2019\u201d","He also said to them
 \u201cImagine that one of you has a friend and you go to that friend in the middle of the night. Imagine saying
 \u2018Friend
 loan me three loaves of bread","because a friend of mine on a journey has arrived and I have nothing to set before him.\u2019","Imagine further that he answers from within the house
 \u2018Don\u2019t bother me. The door is already locked
 and my children and I are in bed. I can\u2019t get up to give you anything.\u2019","I assure you
 even if he wouldn\u2019t get up and help because of his friendship
 he will get up and give his friend whatever he needs because of his friend\u2019s brashness.","And I tell you: Ask and you will receive. Seek and you will find. Knock and the door will be opened to you.","Everyone who asks
 receives. Whoever seeks
 finds. To everyone who knocks
 the door is opened.","\u201cWhich father among you would give a snake to your child if the child asked for a fish?","If a child asked for an egg
 what father would give the child a scorpion?","If you who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children
 how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?\u201d","Jesus was throwing out a demon that causes muteness. When the demon was gone
 the man who couldn\u2019t speak began to talk. The crowds were amazed.","Because Jesus knew what they were thinking
 he said to them
 \u201cEvery kingdom involved in civil war becomes a wasteland
 and a house torn apart by divisions will collapse.","If Satan is at war with himself
 how will his kingdom endure? I ask this because you say that I throw out demons by the authority of Beelzebul.","If I throw out demons by the authority of Beelzebul
 then by whose authority do your followers throw them out? Therefore
 they will be your judges.","But if I throw out demons by the power of God
 then God\u2019s kingdom has already overtaken you.","When a strong man
 fully armed
 guards his own palace
 his possessions are secure.","But as soon as a stronger one attacks and overpowers him
 the stronger one takes away the armor he had trusted and divides the stolen goods.","\u201cWhoever isn\u2019t with me is against me
 and whoever doesn\u2019t gather with me
 scatters.","When an unclean spirit leaves a person
 it wanders through dry places looking for a place to rest. But it doesn\u2019t find any. Then it says
 \u2018I\u2019ll go back to the house I left.\u2019","When it arrives
 it finds the house cleaned up and decorated.","Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more evil than itself. They go in and make their home there. That person is worse off at the end than at the beginning.\u201d","While Jesus was saying these things
 a certain woman in the crowd spoke up: \u201cHappy is the mother who gave birth to you and who nursed you.\u201d","But he said
 \u201cHappy rather are those who hear God\u2019s word and put it into practice.\u201d","When the crowds grew
 Jesus said
 \u201cThis generation is an evil generation. It looks for a sign
 but no sign will be given to it except Jonah\u2019s sign.","Just as Jonah became a sign to the people of Nineveh
 so the Human One will be a sign to this generation.","The queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with the people of this generation and condemn them
 because she came from a distant land to hear Solomon\u2019s wisdom. And look
 someone greater than Solomon is here.","The people of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it
 because they changed their hearts and lives in response to Jonah\u2019s preaching\u2014and one greater than Jonah is here.","\u201cPeople don\u2019t light a lamp and then put it in a closet or under a basket. Rather
 they place the lamp on a lampstand so that those who enter the house can see the light.","Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eye is healthy
 your whole body is full of light. But when your eye is bad
 your whole body is full of darkness.","Therefore
 see to it that the light in you isn\u2019t darkness.","If your whole body is full of light\u2014with no part darkened\u2014then it will be as full of light as when a lamp shines brightly on you.\u201d","The Lord said to him
 \u201cNow
 you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and platter
 but your insides are stuffed with greed and wickedness.","Foolish people! Didn\u2019t the one who made the outside also make the inside?","Therefore
 give to those in need from the core of who you are and you will be clean all over.","\u201cHow terrible for you Pharisees! You give a tenth of your mint
 rue
 and garden herbs of all kinds
 while neglecting justice and love for God. These you ought to have done without neglecting the others.","\u201cHow terrible for you Pharisees! You love the most prominent seats in the synagogues and respectful greetings in the marketplaces.","\u201cHow terrible for you! You are like unmarked graves
 and people walk on them without recognizing it.\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cHow terrible for you legal experts too! You load people down with impossible burdens and you refuse to lift a single finger to help them.","\u201cHow terrible for you! You built memorials to the prophets
 whom your ancestors killed.","In this way
 you testify that you approve of your ancestors\u2019 deeds. They killed the prophets
 and you build memorials!","Therefore
 God\u2019s wisdom has said
 \u2018I will send prophets and apostles to them and they will harass and kill some of them.\u2019","As a result
 this generation will be charged with the murder of all the prophets since the beginning of time.","This includes the murder of every prophet\u2014from Abel to Zechariah\u2014who was killed between the altar and the holy place. Yes
 I\u2019m telling you
 this generation will be charged with it.","\u201cHow terrible for you legal experts! You snatched away the key of knowledge. You didn\u2019t enter yourselves
 and you stood in the way of those who were entering.\u201d","When a crowd of thousands upon thousands had gathered so that they were crushing each other
 Jesus began to speak first to his disciples: \u201cWatch out for the yeast of the Pharisees\u2014I mean
 the mismatch between their hearts and lives.","Nothing is hidden that won\u2019t be revealed
 and nothing is secret that won\u2019t be brought out into the open.","Therefore
 whatever you have said in the darkness will be heard in the light
 and whatever you have whispered in the rooms deep inside the house will be announced from the rooftops.","\u201cI tell you
 my friends
 don\u2019t be terrified by those who can kill the body but after that can do nothing more.","I\u2019ll show you whom you should fear: fear the one who
 after you have been killed
 has the authority to throw you into hell. Indeed
 I tell you
 that\u2019s the one you should fear.","Aren\u2019t five sparrows sold for two small coins? Yet not one of them is overlooked by God.","Even the hairs on your head are all counted. Don\u2019t be afraid. You are worth more than many sparrows.","\u201cI tell you
 everyone who acknowledges me before humans
 the Human One will acknowledge before God\u2019s angels.","But the one who rejects me before others will be rejected before God\u2019s angels.","Anyone who speaks a word against the Human One will be forgiven
 but whoever insults the Holy Spirit won\u2019t be forgiven.","When they bring you before the synagogues
 rulers
 and authorities
 don\u2019t worry about how to defend yourself or what you should say.","The Holy Spirit will tell you at that very moment what you must say.\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cMan
 who appointed me as judge or referee between you and your brother?\u201d","Then Jesus said to them
 \u201cWatch out! Guard yourself against all kinds of greed. After all
 one\u2019s life isn\u2019t determined by one\u2019s possessions
 even when someone is very wealthy.\u201d","Then he told them a parable: \u201cA certain rich man\u2019s land produced a bountiful crop.","He said to himself
 What will I do? I have no place to store my harvest!","Then he thought
 Here\u2019s what I\u2019ll do. I\u2019ll tear down my barns and build bigger ones. That\u2019s where I\u2019ll store all my grain and goods.","I\u2019ll say to myself
 You have stored up plenty of goods
 enough for several years. Take it easy! Eat
 drink
 and enjoy yourself.","But God said to him
 \u2018Fool
 tonight you will die. Now who will get the things you have prepared for yourself?\u2019","This is the way it will be for those who hoard things for themselves and aren\u2019t rich toward God.\u201d","Then Jesus said to his disciples
 \u201cTherefore
 I say to you
 don\u2019t worry about your life
 what you will eat
 or about your body
 what you will wear.","There is more to life than food and more to the body than clothing.","Consider the ravens: they neither plant nor harvest
 they have no silo or barn
 yet God feeds them. You are worth so much more than birds!","Who among you by worrying can add a single moment to your life?","If you can\u2019t do such a small thing
 why worry about the rest?","Notice how the lilies grow. They don\u2019t wear themselves out with work
 and they don\u2019t spin cloth. But I say to you that even Solomon in all his splendor wasn\u2019t dressed like one of these.","If God dresses grass in the field so beautifully
 even though it\u2019s alive today and tomorrow it\u2019s thrown into the furnace
 how much more will God do for you
 you people of weak faith!","Don\u2019t chase after what you will eat and what you will drink. Stop worrying.","All the nations of the world long for these things. Your Father knows that you need them.","Instead
 desire his kingdom and these things will be given to you as well.","\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid
 little flock
 because your Father delights in giving you the kingdom.","Sell your possessions and give to those in need. Make for yourselves wallets that don\u2019t wear out\u2014a treasure in heaven that never runs out. No thief comes near there
 and no moth destroys.","Where your treasure is
 there your heart will be too.","\u201cBe dressed for service and keep your lamps lit.","Be like people waiting for their master to come home from a wedding celebration
 who can immediately open the door for him when he arrives and knocks on the door.","Happy are those servants whom the master finds waiting up when he arrives. I assure you that
 when he arrives
 he will dress himself to serve
 seat them at the table as honored guests
 and wait on them.","Happy are those whom he finds alert
 even if he comes at midnight or just before dawn.","But know this
 if the homeowner had known what time the thief was coming
 he wouldn\u2019t have allowed his home to be broken into.","You also must be ready
 because the Human One is coming at a time when you don\u2019t expect him.\u201d","The Lord replied
 \u201cWho are the faithful and wise managers whom the master will put in charge of his household servants
 to give them their food at the proper time?","Happy are the servants whom the master finds fulfilling their responsibilities when he comes.","I assure you that the master will put them in charge of all his possessions.","\u201cBut suppose that these servants should say to themselves
 My master is taking his time about coming. And suppose they began to beat the servants

 drink
 and get drunk.","The master of those servants would come on a day when they weren\u2019t expecting him
 at a time they couldn\u2019t predict. The master will cut them into pieces and assign them a place with the unfaithful.","That servant who knew his master\u2019s will but didn\u2019t prepare for it or act on it will be beaten severely.","The one who didn\u2019t know the master\u2019s will but who did things deserving punishment will be beaten only a little. Much will be demanded from everyone who has been given much
 and from the one who has been entrusted with much
 even more will be asked.","\u201cI came to cast fire upon the earth. How I wish that it was already ablaze!","I have a baptism I must experience. How I am distressed until it\u2019s completed!","Do you think that I have come to bring peace to the earth? No
 I tell you
 I have come instead to bring division.","From now on
 a household of five will be divided\u2014three against two and two against three.","Father will square off against son and son against father; mother against daughter and daughter against mother; and mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.\u201d","Jesus also said to the crowds
 \u201cWhen you see a cloud forming in the west
 you immediately say
 \u2018It\u2019s going to rain.\u2019 And indeed it does.","And when a south wind blows
 you say
 \u2018A heat wave is coming.\u2019 And it does.","Hypocrites! You know how to interpret conditions on earth and in the sky. How is it that you don\u2019t know how to interpret the present time?","And why don\u2019t you judge for yourselves what is right?","As you are going to court with your accuser
 make your best effort to reach a settlement along the way. Otherwise
 your accuser may bring you before the judge
 and the judge hand you over to the officer
 and the officer throw you into prison.","I tell you
 you won\u2019t get out of there until you have paid the very last cent.\u201d","He replied
 \u201cDo you think the suffering of these Galileans proves that they were more sinful than all the other Galileans?","No
 I tell you
 but unless you change your hearts and lives
 you will die just as they did.","What about those eighteen people who were killed when the tower of Siloam fell on them? Do you think that they were more guilty of wrongdoing than everyone else who lives in Jerusalem?","No
 I tell you
 but unless you change your hearts and lives
 you will die just as they did.\u201d","Jesus told this parable: \u201cA man owned a fig tree planted in his vineyard. He came looking for fruit on it and found none.","He said to his gardener
 \u2018Look
 I\u2019ve come looking for fruit on this fig tree for the past three years
 and I\u2019ve never found any. Cut it down! Why should it continue depleting the soil\u2019s nutrients?\u2019","The gardener responded
 \u2018Lord
 give it one more year
 and I will dig around it and give it fertilizer.","Maybe it will produce fruit next year; if not
 then you can cut it down.\u2019\u201d","When he saw her
 Jesus called her to him and said
 \u201cWoman
 you are set free from your sickness.\u201d","The Lord replied
 \u201cHypocrites! Don\u2019t each of you on the Sabbath untie your ox or donkey from its stall and lead it out to get a drink?","Then isn\u2019t it necessary that this woman
 a daughter of Abraham
 bound by Satan for eighteen long years
 be set free from her bondage on the Sabbath day?\u201d","Jesus asked
 \u201cWhat is God\u2019s kingdom like? To what can I compare it?","It\u2019s like a mustard seed that someone took and planted in a garden. It grew and developed into a tree and the birds in the sky nested in its branches.\u201d","Again he said
 \u201cTo what can I compare God\u2019s kingdom?","It\u2019s like yeast
 which a woman took and hid in a bushel of wheat flour until the yeast had worked its way through the whole.\u201d","Someone said to him
 \u201cLord
 will only a few be saved?\u201d Jesus said to them
","\u201cMake every effort to enter through the narrow gate. Many
 I tell you
 will try to enter and won\u2019t be able to.","Once the owner of the house gets up and shuts the door
 then you will stand outside and knock on the door
 saying
 \u2018Lord
 open the door for us.\u2019 He will reply
 \u2018I don\u2019t know you or where you are from.\u2019","Then you will begin to say
 \u2018We ate and drank in your presence
 and you taught in our streets.\u2019","He will respond
 \u2018I don\u2019t know you or where you are from. Go away from me
 all you evildoers!\u2019","There will be weeping and grinding of teeth when you see Abraham
 Isaac
 Jacob
 and all the prophets in God\u2019s kingdom
 but you yourselves will be thrown out.","People will come from east and west
 north and south
 and sit down to eat in God\u2019s kingdom.","Look! Those who are last will be first and those who are first will be last.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cGo
 tell that fox
 \u2018Look
 I\u2019m throwing out demons and healing people today and tomorrow
 and on the third day I will complete my work.","However
 it\u2019s necessary for me to travel today
 tomorrow
 and the next day because it\u2019s impossible for a prophet to be killed outside of Jerusalem.\u2019","\u201cJerusalem
 Jerusalem
 you who kill the prophets and stone those who were sent to you! How often I have wanted to gather your people just as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings. But you didn\u2019t want that.","Look
 your house is abandoned. I tell you
 you won\u2019t see me until the time comes when you say
 Blessings on the one who comes in the Lord\u2019s name.\u201d","Jesus asked the lawyers and Pharisees
 \u201cDoes the Law allow healing on the Sabbath or not?\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cSuppose your child or ox fell into a ditch on the Sabbath day. Wouldn\u2019t you immediately pull it out?\u201d","\u201cWhen someone invites you to a wedding celebration
 don\u2019t take your seat in the place of honor. Someone more highly regarded than you could have been invited by your host.","The host who invited both of you will come and say to you
 \u2018Give your seat to this other person.\u2019 Embarrassed
 you will take your seat in the least important place.","Instead
 when you receive an invitation
 go and sit in the least important place. When your host approaches you
 he will say
 \u2018Friend
 move up here to a better seat.\u2019 Then you will be honored in the presence of all your fellow guests.","All who lift themselves up will be brought low
 and those who make themselves low will be lifted up.\u201d","Then Jesus said to the person who had invited him
 \u201cWhen you host a lunch or dinner
 don\u2019t invite your friends
 your brothers and sisters
 your relatives
 or rich neighbors. If you do
 they will invite you in return and that will be your reward.","Instead
 when you give a banquet
 invite the poor
 crippled
 lame
 and blind.","And you will be blessed because they can\u2019t repay you. Instead
 you will be repaid when the just are resurrected.\u201d","When one of the dinner guests heard Jesus\u2019 remarks
 he said to Jesus
 \u201cHappy are those who will feast in God\u2019s kingdom.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cA certain man hosted a large dinner and invited many people.","When it was time for the dinner to begin
 he sent his servant to tell the invited guests
 \u2018Come! The dinner is now ready.\u2019","One by one
 they all began to make excuses. The first one told him
 \u2018I bought a farm and must go and see it. Please excuse me.\u2019","Another said
 \u2018I bought five teams of oxen
 and I\u2019m going to check on them. Please excuse me.\u2019","Another said
 \u2018I just got married
 so I can\u2019t come.\u2019","When he returned
 the servant reported these excuses to his master. The master of the house became angry and said to his servant
 \u2018Go quickly to the city\u2019s streets
 the busy ones and the side streets
 and bring the poor
 crippled
 blind
 and lame.\u2019","The servant said
 \u2018Master
 your instructions have been followed and there is still room.\u2019","The master said to the servant
 \u2018Go to the highways and back alleys and urge people to come in so that my house will be filled.","I tell you
 not one of those who were invited will taste my dinner.\u2019\u201d","Large crowds were traveling with Jesus. Turning to them
 he said
","\u201cWhoever comes to me and doesn\u2019t hate father and mother
 spouse and children
 and brothers and sisters\u2014yes
 even one\u2019s own life\u2014cannot be my disciple.","Whoever doesn\u2019t carry their own cross and follow me cannot be my disciple.","\u201cIf one of you wanted to build a tower
 wouldn\u2019t you first sit down and calculate the cost
 to determine whether you have enough money to complete it?","Otherwise
 when you have laid the foundation but couldn\u2019t finish the tower
 all who see it will begin to belittle you.","They will say
 \u2018Here\u2019s the person who began construction and couldn\u2019t complete it!\u2019","Or what king would go to war against another king without first sitting down to consider whether his ten thousand soldiers could go up against the twenty thousand coming against him?","And if he didn\u2019t think he could win
 he would send a representative to discuss terms of peace while his enemy was still a long way off.","In the same way
 none of you who are unwilling to give up all of your possessions can be my disciple.","\u201cSalt is good. But if salt loses its flavor
 how will it become salty again?","It has no value
 neither for the soil nor for the manure pile. People throw it away. Whoever has ears to hear should pay attention.\u201d","\u201cSuppose someone among you had one hundred sheep and lost one of them. Wouldn\u2019t he leave the other ninety-nine in the pasture and search for the lost one until he finds it?","And when he finds it
 he is thrilled and places it on his shoulders.","When he arrives home
 he calls together his friends and neighbors
 saying to them
 \u2018Celebrate with me because I\u2019ve found my lost sheep.\u2019","In the same way
 I tell you
 there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who changes both heart and life than over ninety-nine righteous people who have no need to change their hearts and lives.","\u201cOr what woman
 if she owns ten silver coins and loses one of them
 won\u2019t light a lamp and sweep the house
 searching her home carefully until she finds it?","When she finds it
 she calls together her friends and neighbors
 saying
 \u2018Celebrate with me because I\u2019ve found my lost coin.\u2019","In the same way
 I tell you
 joy breaks out in the presence of God\u2019s angels over one sinner who changes both heart and life.\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cA certain man had two sons.","The younger son said to his father
 \u2018Father
 give me my share of the inheritance.\u2019 Then the father divided his estate between them.","Soon afterward
 the younger son gathered everything together and took a trip to a land far away. There
 he wasted his wealth through extravagant living.","\u201cWhen he had used up his resources
 a severe food shortage arose in that country and he began to be in need.","He hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country
 who sent him into his fields to feed pigs.","He longed to eat his fill from what the pigs ate
 but no one gave him anything.","When he came to his senses
 he said
 \u2018How many of my father\u2019s hired hands have more than enough food
 but I\u2019m starving to death!","I will get up and go to my father
 and say to him
 \u201cFather
 I have sinned against heaven and against you.","I no longer deserve to be called your son. Take me on as one of your hired hands.\u201d \u2019","So he got up and went to his father. \u201cWhile he was still a long way off
 his father saw him and was moved with compassion. His father ran to him
 hugged him
 and kissed him.","Then his son said
 \u2018Father
 I have sinned against heaven and against you. I no longer deserve to be called your son.\u2019","But the father said to his servants
 \u2018Quickly
 bring out the best robe and put it on him! Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet!","Fetch the fattened calf and slaughter it. We must celebrate with feasting","because this son of mine was dead and has come back to life! He was lost and is found!\u2019 And they began to celebrate.","\u201cNow his older son was in the field. Coming in from the field
 he approached the house and heard music and dancing.","He called one of the servants and asked what was going on.","The servant replied
 \u2018Your brother has arrived
 and your father has slaughtered the fattened calf because he received his son back safe and sound.\u2019","Then the older son was furious and didn\u2019t want to enter in
 but his father came out and begged him.","He answered his father
 \u2018Look
 I\u2019ve served you all these years
 and I never disobeyed your instruction. Yet you\u2019ve never given me as much as a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends.","But when this son of yours returned
 after gobbling up your estate on prostitutes
 you slaughtered the fattened calf for him.\u2019","Then his father said
 \u2018Son
 you are always with me
 and everything I have is yours.","But we had to celebrate and be glad because this brother of yours was dead and is alive. He was lost and is found.\u2019\u201d","Jesus also said to the disciples
 \u201cA certain rich man heard that his household manager was wasting his estate.","He called the manager in and said to him
 \u2018What is this I hear about you? Give me a report of your administration because you can no longer serve as my manager.\u2019","\u201cThe household manager said to himself
 What will I do now that my master is firing me as his manager? I\u2019m not strong enough to dig and too proud to beg.","I know what I\u2019ll do so that
 when I am removed from my management position
 people will welcome me into their houses.","\u201cOne by one
 the manager sent for each person who owed his master money. He said to the first
 \u2018How much do you owe my master?\u2019","He said
 \u2018Nine hundred gallons of olive oil.\u2019 The manager said to him
 \u2018Take your contract
 sit down quickly
 and write four hundred fifty gallons.\u2019","Then the manager said to another
 \u2018How much do you owe?\u2019 He said
 \u2018One thousand bushels of wheat.\u2019 He said
 \u2018Take your contract and write eight hundred.\u2019","\u201cThe master commended the dishonest manager because he acted cleverly. People who belong to this world are more clever in dealing with their peers than are people who belong to the light.","I tell you
 use worldly wealth to make friends for yourselves so that when it\u2019s gone
 you will be welcomed into the eternal homes.","\u201cWhoever is faithful with little is also faithful with much
 and the one who is dishonest with little is also dishonest with much.","If you haven\u2019t been faithful with worldly wealth
 who will trust you with true riches?","If you haven\u2019t been faithful with someone else\u2019s property
 who will give you your own?","No household servant can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other
 or you will be loyal to the one and have contempt for the other. You cannot serve God and wealth.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cYou are the ones who justify yourselves before other people
 but God knows your hearts. What is highly valued by people is deeply offensive to God.","Until John
 there was only the Law and the Prophets. Since then
 the good news of God\u2019s kingdom is preached
 and everyone is urged to enter it.","It\u2019s easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for the smallest stroke of a pen in the Law to drop out.","Any man who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery
 and a man who marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery.","\u201cThere was a certain rich man who clothed himself in purple and fine linen
 and who feasted luxuriously every day.","At his gate lay a certain poor man named Lazarus who was covered with sores.","Lazarus longed to eat the crumbs that fell from the rich man\u2019s table. Instead
 dogs would come and lick his sores.","\u201cThe poor man died and was carried by angels to Abraham\u2019s side. The rich man also died and was buried.","While being tormented in the place of the dead
 he looked up and saw Abraham at a distance with Lazarus at his side.","He shouted
 \u2018Father Abraham
 have mercy on me. Send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue
 because I\u2019m suffering in this flame.\u2019","But Abraham said
 \u2018Child
 remember that during your lifetime you received good things
 whereas Lazarus received terrible things. Now Lazarus is being comforted and you are in great pain.","Moreover
 a great crevasse has been fixed between us and you. Those who wish to cross over from here to you cannot. Neither can anyone cross from there to us.\u2019","\u201cThe rich man said
 \u2018Then I beg you
 Father
 send Lazarus to my father\u2019s house.","I have five brothers. He needs to warn them so that they don\u2019t come to this place of agony.\u2019","Abraham replied
 \u2018They have Moses and the Prophets. They must listen to them.\u2019","The rich man said
 \u2018No
 Father Abraham! But if someone from the dead goes to them
 they will change their hearts and lives.\u2019","Abraham said
 \u2018If they don\u2019t listen to Moses and the Prophets
 then neither will they be persuaded if someone rises from the dead.\u2019\u201d","Jesus said to his disciples
 \u201cThings that cause people to trip and fall into sin must happen
 but how terrible it is for the person through whom they happen.","It would be better for them to be thrown into a lake with a large stone hung around their neck than to cause one of these little ones to trip and fall into sin.","Watch yourselves! If your brother or sister sins
 warn them to stop. If they change their hearts and lives
 forgive them.","Even if someone sins against you seven times in one day and returns to you seven times and says
 \u2018I am changing my ways
\u2019 you must forgive that person.\u201d","The Lord replied
 \u201cIf you had faith the size of a mustard seed
 you could say to this mulberry tree
 \u2018Be uprooted and planted in the sea
\u2019 and it would obey you.","\u201cWould any of you say to your servant
 who had just come in from the field after plowing or tending sheep
 \u2018Come! Sit down for dinner\u2019?","Wouldn\u2019t you say instead
 \u2018Fix my dinner. Put on the clothes of a table servant and wait on me while I eat and drink. After that
 you can eat and drink\u2019?","You won\u2019t thank the servant because the servant did what you asked
 will you?","In the same way
 when you have done everything required of you
 you should say
 \u2018We servants deserve no special praise. We have only done our duty.\u2019\u201d","On the way to Jerusalem
 Jesus traveled along the border between Samaria and Galilee.","When Jesus saw them
 he said
 \u201cGo
 show yourselves to the priests.\u201d As they left
 they were cleansed.","Jesus replied
 \u201cWeren\u2019t ten cleansed? Where are the other nine?","No one returned to praise God except this foreigner?\u201d","Then Jesus said to him
 \u201cGet up and go. Your faith has healed you.\u201d","Pharisees asked Jesus when God\u2019s kingdom was coming. He replied
 \u201cGod\u2019s kingdom isn\u2019t coming with signs that are easily noticed.","Nor will people say
 \u2018Look
 here it is!\u2019 or \u2018There it is!\u2019 Don\u2019t you see? God\u2019s kingdom is already among you.\u201d","Then Jesus said to the disciples
 \u201cThe time will come when you will long to see one of the days of the Human One
 and you won\u2019t see it.","People will say to you
 \u2018Look there!\u2019 or \u2018Look here!\u2019 Don\u2019t leave or go chasing after them.","The Human One will appear on his day in the same way that a flash of lightning lights up the sky from one end to the other.","However
 first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.","\u201cAs it was in the days of Noah
 so it will be during the days of the Human One.","People were eating
 drinking
 marrying
 and being given in marriage until the day Noah entered the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all.","Likewise in the days of Lot
 people were eating
 drinking
 buying
 selling
 planting
 and building.","But on the day Lot left Sodom
 fire and sulfur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all.","That\u2019s the way it will be on the day the Human One is revealed.","On that day
 those on the roof
 whose possessions are in the house
 shouldn\u2019t come down to grab them. Likewise
 those in the field shouldn\u2019t turn back.","Remember Lot\u2019s wife!","Whoever tries to preserve their life will lose it
 but whoever loses their life will preserve it.","I tell you
 on that night two people will be in the same bed: one will be taken and the other left.","Two women will be grinding grain together: one will be taken and the other left.\u201d","The disciples asked
 \u201cWhere
 Lord?\u201d Jesus said
 \u201cThe vultures gather wherever there\u2019s a dead body.\u201d","He said
 \u201cIn a certain city there was a judge who neither feared God nor respected people.","In that city there was a widow who kept coming to him
 asking
 \u2018Give me justice in this case against my adversary.\u2019","For a while he refused but finally said to himself
 I don\u2019t fear God or respect people
","but I will give this widow justice because she keeps bothering me. Otherwise
 there will be no end to her coming here and embarrassing me.\u201d","The Lord said
 \u201cListen to what the unjust judge says.","Won\u2019t God provide justice to his chosen people who cry out to him day and night? Will he be slow to help them?","I tell you
 he will give them justice quickly. But when the Human One comes
 will he find faithfulness on earth?\u201d","\u201cTwo people went up to the temple to pray. One was a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.","The Pharisee stood and prayed about himself with these words
 \u2018God
 I thank you that I\u2019m not like everyone else\u2014crooks
 evildoers
 adulterers\u2014or even like this tax collector.","I fast twice a week. I give a tenth of everything I receive.\u2019","But the tax collector stood at a distance. He wouldn\u2019t even lift his eyes to look toward heaven. Rather
 he struck his chest and said
 \u2018God
 show mercy to me
 a sinner.\u2019","I tell you
 this person went down to his home justified rather than the Pharisee. All who lift themselves up will be brought low
 and those who make themselves low will be lifted up.\u201d","Then Jesus called them to him and said
 \u201cAllow the children to come to me. Don\u2019t forbid them
 because God\u2019s kingdom belongs to people like these children.","I assure you that whoever doesn\u2019t welcome God\u2019s kingdom like a child will never enter it.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cWhy do you call me good? No one is good except the one God.","You know the commandments: Don\u2019t commit adultery. Don\u2019t murder. Don\u2019t steal. Don\u2019t give false testimony. Honor your father and mother.\u201d","Then the ruler said
 \u201cI\u2019ve kept all of these things since I was a boy.\u201d","When Jesus heard this
 he said
 \u201cThere\u2019s one more thing. Sell everything you own and distribute the money to the poor. Then you will have treasure in heaven. And come
 follow me.\u201d","When Jesus saw this
 he said
 \u201cIt\u2019s very hard for the wealthy to enter God\u2019s kingdom!","It\u2019s easier for a camel to squeeze through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter God\u2019s kingdom.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cWhat is impossible for humans is possible for God.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cI assure you that anyone who has left house
 husband
 wife
 brothers
 sisters
 parents
 or children because of God\u2019s kingdom","will receive many times more in this age and eternal life in the coming age.\u201d","Jesus took the Twelve aside and said
 \u201cLook
 we\u2019re going up to Jerusalem

 mistreated
 and spit on.","After torturing him
 they will kill him. On the third day
 he will rise up.\u201d","But the Twelve understood none of these words. The meaning of this message was hidden from them and they didn\u2019t grasp what he was saying.","\u201cWhat do you want me to do for you?\u201d He said
 \u201cLord
 I want to see.\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cReceive your sight! Your faith has healed you.\u201d","When Jesus came to that spot
 he looked up and said
 \u201cZacchaeus
 come down at once. I must stay in your home today.\u201d","Zacchaeus stopped and said to the Lord
 \u201cLook
 Lord
 I give half of my possessions to the poor. And if I have cheated anyone
 I repay them four times as much.\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cToday
 salvation has come to this household because he too is a son of Abraham.","The Human One came to seek and save the lost.\u201d","He said
 \u201cA certain man who was born into royalty went to a distant land to receive his kingdom and then return.","He called together ten servants and gave each of them money worth four months\u2019 wages. He said
 \u2018Do business with this until I return.\u2019","His citizens hated him
 so they sent a representative after him who said
 \u2018We don\u2019t want this man to be our king.\u2019","After receiving his kingdom
 he returned and called the servants to whom he had given the money to find out how much they had earned.","The first servant came forward and said
 \u2018Your money has earned a return of one thousand percent.\u2019","The king replied
 \u2018Excellent! You are a good servant. Because you have been faithful in a small matter
 you will have authority over ten cities.\u2019","\u201cThe second servant came and said
 \u2018Master
 your money has made a return of five hundred percent.\u2019","To this one
 the king said
 \u2018You will have authority over five cities.\u2019","\u201cAnother servant came and said
 \u2018Master
 here is your money. I wrapped it up in a scarf for safekeeping.","I was afraid of you because you are a stern man. You withdraw what you haven\u2019t deposited and you harvest what you haven\u2019t planted.\u2019","The king replied
 \u2018I will judge you by the words of your own mouth
 you worthless servant! You knew
 did you
 that I\u2019m a stern man
 withdrawing what I didn\u2019t deposit
 and harvesting what I didn\u2019t plant?","Why then didn\u2019t you put my money in the bank? Then when I arrived
 at least I could have gotten it back with interest.\u2019","\u201cHe said to his attendants
 \u2018Take his money and give it to the one who has ten times as much.\u2019","\u2018But Master
\u2019 they said

 \u201cI have a question for you. Tell me:","Was John\u2019s baptism of heavenly or of human origin?\u201d","Then Jesus replied
 \u201cNeither will I tell you what kind of authority I have to do these things.\u201d","Jesus told the people this parable: \u201cA certain man planted a vineyard

 their faces downcast.","He said to them
 \u201cWhat things?\u201d They said to him

 many men in Israel had leprosy. But no one was healed

 \u201cI want to! Now you are well.\u201d At once the man\u2019s leprosy disappeared. ","Jesus told him
 \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone about this

 \u201cIf this man really were a prophet
 he would know what kind of woman is touching him! He would know that she is a sinner.\u201d","Jesus said to the Pharisee
 \u201cSimon
 I have something to say to you.\u201d \u201cTeacher
 what is it?\u201d Simon replied.","Jesus told him
 \u201cTwo people were in debt to a moneylender. One of them owed him five hundred silver coins
 and the other owed him fifty. ","Since neither of them could pay him back
 the moneylender said that they didn\u2019t have to pay him anything. Which one of them will like him more?\u201d","Simon answered
 \u201cI suppose it would be the one who had owed more and didn\u2019t have to pay it back.\u201d \u201cYou are right
\u201d Jesus said.","He turned toward the woman and said to Simon
 \u201cHave you noticed this woman? When I came into your home
 you didn\u2019t give me any water so I could wash my feet. But she has washed my feet with her tears and dried them with her hair. ","You didn\u2019t greet me with a kiss
 but from the time I came in
 she has not stopped kissing my feet. ","You didn\u2019t even pour olive oil on my head
 but she has poured expensive perfume on my feet. ","So I tell you that all her sins are forgiven
 and that is why she has shown great love. But anyone who has been forgiven for only a little will show only a little love.\u201d","Then Jesus said to the woman
 \u201cYour sins are forgiven.\u201d","But Jesus told the woman
 \u201cBecause of your faith
 you are now saved. May God give you peace!\u201d","When a large crowd from several towns had gathered around Jesus
 he told them this story:","A farmer went out to scatter seed in a field. While the farmer was doing it
 some of the seeds fell along the road and were stepped on or eaten by birds. ","Other seeds fell on rocky ground and started growing. But the plants did not have enough water and soon dried up.","Some other seeds fell where thornbushes grew up and choked the plants.","The rest of the seeds fell on good ground where they grew and produced a hundred times as many seeds. When Jesus had finished speaking
 he said
 \u201cIf you have ears
 pay attention!\u201d","So he answered: I have explained the secrets about God\u2019s kingdom to you
 but for others I can only use stories. These people look
 but they don\u2019t see
 and they hear
 but they don\u2019t understand.","This is what the story means: The seed is God\u2019s message
 ","and the seeds that fell along the road are the people who hear the message. But the devil comes and snatches the message out of their hearts
 so that they will not believe and be saved. ","The seeds that fell on rocky ground are the people who gladly hear the message and accept it. But they don\u2019t have deep roots
 and they believe only for a little while. As soon as life gets hard
 they give up.","The seeds that fell among the thornbushes are also people who hear the message. But they are so eager for riches and pleasures that they never produce anything.","Those seeds that fell on good ground are the people who listen to the message and keep it in good and honest hearts. They last and produce a harvest.","No one lights a lamp and puts it under a bowl or under a bed. A lamp is always put on a lampstand

 but people who have nothing will lose what little they think they have.","Someone told Jesus

 Father

 one of his disciples said to him
 \u201cLord

 the man started speaking
 and the crowds were amazed. ","Jesus knew what they were thinking

 a woman in the crowd spoke up
 \u201cThe woman who gave birth to you and nursed you is blessed!\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cThat\u2019s true

 you are really in for trouble. You build monuments to honor the prophets your own people murdered long ago. ","You must think that was the right thing for your people to do

 the master will come on a day and at a time when the servant least expects him. That servant will then be punished and thrown out with the servants who cannot be trusted.","If servants are not ready or willing to do what their master wants them to do

 Jacob
 and all the prophets in God\u2019s kingdom. ","People will come from all directions and sit down to feast in God\u2019s kingdom.","There the ones who are now least important will be the most important
 and those who are now most important will be least important.","Jesus said to them: Go tell that fox
 \u201cI am going to force out demons and heal people today and tomorrow
 and three days later I\u2019ll be through.\u201d ","But I am going on my way today and tomorrow and the next day. After all
 Jerusalem is the place where prophets are killed.","Jerusalem
 Jerusalem! Your people have killed the prophets and have stoned the messengers who were sent to you. I have often wanted to gather your people
 as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings. But you wouldn\u2019t let me. ","Now your temple will be deserted. You won\u2019t see me again until the time when you say
 \u201cBlessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord.\u201d","Jesus turned and asked the Pharisees and the teachers of the Law of Moses
 \u201cIs it right to heal on the Sabbath?\u201d ","Afterwards
 Jesus asked the people
 \u201cIf your son or ox falls into a well
 wouldn\u2019t you pull him out right away
 even on the Sabbath?\u201d ","When you are invited to a wedding feast
 don\u2019t sit in the best place. Someone more important may have been invited. ","Then the one who invited you will come and say
 \u201cGive your place to this other guest!\u201d You will be embarrassed and will have to sit in the worst place.","When you are invited to be a guest
 go and sit in the worst place. Then the one who invited you may come and say
 \u201cMy friend
 take a better seat!\u201d You will then be honored in front of all the other guests. ","If you put yourself above others
 you will be put down. But if you humble yourself
 you will be honored.","Then Jesus said to the man who had invited him: When you give a dinner or a banquet
 don\u2019t invite your friends and family and relatives and rich neighbors. If you do
 they will invite you in return
 and you will be paid back. ","When you give a feast
 invite the poor
 the crippled
 the lame
 and the blind. ","They cannot pay you back. But God will bless you and reward you when his people rise from death.","After Jesus had finished speaking
 one of the guests said
 \u201cThe greatest blessing of all is to be at the banquet in God\u2019s kingdom!\u201d","Jesus told him: A man once gave a great banquet and invited a lot of guests.","When the banquet was ready
 he sent a servant to tell the guests
 \u201cEverything is ready! Please come.\u201d","One guest after another started making excuses. The first one said
 \u201cI bought some land
 and I\u2019ve got to look it over. Please excuse me.\u201d","Another guest said
 \u201cI bought five teams of oxen
 and I need to try them out. Please excuse me.\u201d","Still another guest said
 \u201cI have just gotten married
 and I can\u2019t be there.\u201d","The servant told his master what happened
 and the master became so angry that he said
 \u201cGo as fast as you can to every street and alley in town! Bring in everyone who is poor or crippled or blind or lame.\u201d","When the servant returned
 he said
 \u201cMaster
 I\u2019ve done what you told me
 and there is still plenty of room for more people.\u201d","His master then told him
 \u201cGo out along the back roads and fence rows and make people come in
 so that my house will be full. ","Not one of the guests I first invited will get even a bite of my food!\u201d","Large crowds were walking along with Jesus
 when he turned and said:","You cannot be my disciple
 unless you love me more than you love your father and mother
 your wife and children
 and your brothers and sisters. You cannot come with me unless you love me more than you love your own life.","You cannot be my disciple unless you carry your own cross and come with me.","Suppose one of you wants to build a tower. What is the first thing you will do? Won\u2019t you sit down and figure out how much it will cost and if you have enough money to pay for it?","Otherwise
 you will start building the tower
 but not be able to finish. Then everyone who sees what is happening will laugh at you. ","They will say
 \u201cYou started building
 but could not finish the job.\u201d","What will a king do if he has only ten thousand soldiers to defend himself against a king who is about to attack him with twenty thousand soldiers? Before he goes out to battle
 won\u2019t he first sit down and decide if he can win? ","If he thinks he won\u2019t be able to defend himself
 he will send messengers and ask for peace while the other king is still a long way off. ","So then
 you cannot be my disciple unless you give away everything you own.","Salt is good
 but if it no longer tastes like salt
 how can it be made to taste salty again? ","It is no longer good for the soil or even for the manure pile. People simply throw it out. If you have ears
 pay attention!","If any of you has a hundred sheep
 and one of them gets lost
 what will you do? Won\u2019t you leave the ninety-nine in the field and go look for the lost sheep until you find it? ","And when you find it
 you will be so glad that you will put it on your shoulder ","and carry it home. Then you will call in your friends and neighbors and say
 \u201cLet\u2019s celebrate! I\u2019ve found my lost sheep.\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cIn the same way there is more happiness in heaven because of one sinner who turns to God than over ninety-nine good people who don\u2019t need to.\u201d","Jesus told the people another story: What will a woman do if she has ten silver coins and loses one of them? Won\u2019t she light a lamp
 sweep the floor
 and look carefully until she finds it? ","Then she will call in her friends and neighbors and say
 \u201cLet\u2019s celebrate! I\u2019ve found the coin I lost.\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cIn the same way God\u2019s angels are happy when even one person turns to him.\u201d","Jesus also told them another story: Once a man had two sons.","The younger son said to his father
 \u201cGive me my share of the property.\u201d So the father divided his property between his two sons.","Not long after that
 the younger son packed up everything he owned and left for a foreign country
 where he wasted all his money in wild living. ","He had spent everything
 when a bad famine spread through that whole land. Soon he had nothing to eat.","He went to work for a man in that country
 and the man sent him out to take care of his pigs. ","He would have been glad to eat what the pigs were eating
 but no one gave him a thing.","Finally
 he came to his senses and said
 \u201cMy father\u2019s workers have plenty to eat
 and here I am
 starving to death! ","I will go to my father and say to him
 \u2018Father
 I have sinned against God in heaven and against you. ","I am no longer good enough to be called your son. Treat me like one of your workers.\u2019\u201d","The younger son got up and started back to his father. But when he was still a long way off
 his father saw him and felt sorry for him. He ran to his son and hugged and kissed him.","The son said
 \u201cFather
 I have sinned against God in heaven and against you. I am no longer good enough to be called your son.\u201d","But his father said to the servants
 \u201cHurry and bring the best clothes and put them on him. Give him a ring for his finger and sandals for his feet. ","Get the best calf and prepare it
 so we can eat and celebrate. ","This son of mine was dead
 but has now come back to life. He was lost and has now been found.\u201d And they began to celebrate.","The older son had been out in the field. But when he came near the house
 he heard the music and dancing. ","So he called one of the servants over and asked
 \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d","The servant answered
 \u201cYour brother has come home safe and sound
 and your father ordered us to kill the best calf.\u201d ","The older brother got so angry that he would not even go into the house. His father came out and begged him to go in.","But he said to his father
 \u201cFor years I have worked for you like a slave and have always obeyed you. But you have never even given me a little goat
 so that I could give a dinner for my friends. ","This other son of yours wasted your money on prostitutes. And now that he has come home
 you ordered the best calf to be killed for a feast.\u201d","His father replied
 \u201cMy son
 you are always with me
 and everything I have is yours. ","But we should be glad and celebrate! Your brother was dead
 but he is now alive. He was lost and has now been found.\u201d","Jesus said to his disciples: A rich man once had a manager to take care of his business. But he was told that his manager was wasting money.","So the rich man called him in and said
 \u201cWhat is this I hear about you? Tell me what you have done! You are no longer going to work for me.\u201d","The manager said to himself
 \u201cWhat shall I do now that my master is going to fire me? I can\u2019t dig ditches
 and I\u2019m ashamed to beg. ","I know what I\u2019ll do
 so that people will welcome me into their homes after I\u2019ve lost my job.\u201d","Then one by one he called in the people who were in debt to his master. He asked the first one
 \u201cHow much do you owe my master?\u201d","\u201cA hundred barrels of olive oil
\u201d the man answered. So the manager said
 \u201cTake your bill and sit down and quickly write \u2018fifty\u2019.\u201d","The manager asked someone else who was in debt to his master
 \u201cHow much do you owe?\u201d \u201cA thousand bushels of wheat
\u201d the man replied. The manager said
 \u201cTake your bill and write \u2018eight hundred\u2019.\u201d","The master praised his dishonest manager for looking out for himself so well. That\u2019s how it is! The people of this world look out for themselves better than the people who belong to the light.","My disciples
 I tell you to use wicked wealth to make friends for yourselves. Then when it is gone
 you will be welcomed into an eternal home. ","Anyone who can be trusted in little matters can also be trusted in important matters. But anyone who is dishonest in little matters will be dishonest in important matters.","If you cannot be trusted with this wicked wealth
 who will trust you with true wealth? ","And if you cannot be trusted with what belongs to someone else
 who will give you something that will be your own? ","You cannot be the slave of two masters. You will like one more than the other or be more loyal to one than to the other. You cannot serve God and money.","But Jesus told them: You are always making yourselves look good
 but God sees what is in your heart. The things that most people think are important are worthless as far as God is concerned.","Until the time of John the Baptist
 people had to obey the Law of Moses and the Books of the Prophets. But since God\u2019s kingdom has been preached
 everyone is trying hard to get in. ","Heaven and earth will disappear before the smallest letter of the Law does.","It is a terrible sin for a man to divorce his wife and marry another woman. It is also a terrible sin for a man to marry a divorced woman.","There was once a rich man who wore expensive clothes and every day ate the best food.","But a poor beggar named Lazarus was brought to the gate of the rich man\u2019s house.","He was happy just to eat the scraps that fell from the rich man\u2019s table. His body was covered with sores
 and dogs kept coming up to lick them. ","The poor man died
 and angels took him to the place of honor next to Abraham. The rich man also died and was buried. ","He went to hell and was suffering terribly. When he looked up and saw Abraham far off and Lazarus at his side
 ","he said to Abraham
 \u201cHave pity on me! Send Lazarus to dip his finger in water and touch my tongue. I\u2019m suffering terribly in this fire.\u201d","Abraham answered
 \u201cMy friend
 remember that while you lived
 you had everything good
 and Lazarus had everything bad. Now he is happy
 and you are in pain. ","And besides
 there is a deep ditch between us
 and no one from either side can cross over.\u201d","But the rich man said
 \u201cAbraham
 then please send Lazarus to my father\u2019s home. ","Let him warn my five brothers
 so they won\u2019t come to this horrible place.\u201d","Abraham answered
 \u201cYour brothers can read what Moses and the prophets wrote. They should pay attention to that.\u201d","Then the rich man said
 \u201cNo
 that\u2019s not enough! If only someone from the dead would go to them
 they would listen and turn to God.\u201d","So Abraham said
 \u201cIf they won\u2019t pay attention to Moses and the prophets
 they won\u2019t listen even to someone who comes back from the dead.\u201d","Jesus said to his disciples: There will always be something that causes people to sin. But anyone who causes them to sin is in for trouble. A person who causes even one of my little followers to sin","would be better off thrown into the ocean with a heavy stone tied around their neck.","So be careful what you do. Correct any followers of mine who sin
 and forgive the ones who say they are sorry. ","Even if one of them mistreats you seven times in one day and says
 \u201cI am sorry
\u201d you should still forgive that person.","Jesus replied: If you had faith no bigger than a tiny mustard seed
 you could tell this mulberry tree to pull itself up
 roots and all
 and to plant itself in the ocean. And it would!","If your servant comes in from plowing or from taking care of the sheep
 would you say
 \u201cWelcome! Come on in and have something to eat\u201d? ","No
 you wouldn\u2019t say that. You would say
 \u201cFix me something to eat. Get ready to serve me
 so I can have my meal. Then later on you can eat and drink.\u201d ","Servants don\u2019t deserve special thanks for doing what they are supposed to do.","And that\u2019s how it should be with you. When you\u2019ve done all you should
 then say
 \u201cWe are merely servants
 and we have simply done our duty.\u201d","On his way to Jerusalem
 Jesus went along the border between Samaria and Galilee. ","Jesus looked at them and said
 \u201cGo show yourselves to the priests.\u201d On their way they were healed. ","Jesus asked
 \u201cWeren\u2019t ten men healed? Where are the other nine? ","Why was this foreigner the only one who came back to thank God?\u201d","Then Jesus told the man
 \u201cYou may get up and go. Your faith has made you well.\u201d","Some Pharisees asked Jesus when God\u2019s kingdom would come. He answered
 \u201cGod\u2019s kingdom isn\u2019t something you can see. ","There is no use saying
 \u2018Look! Here it is' or \u2018Look! There it is.\u2019 God\u2019s kingdom is here with you.\u201d","Jesus said to his disciples: The time will come when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man
 but you will not. ","When people say to you
 \u201cLook there
\u201d or \u201cLook here
\u201d don\u2019t go looking for him. ","The day of the Son of Man will be like lightning flashing across the sky.","But first he must suffer terribly and be rejected by the people of today.","When the Son of Man comes
 things will be just as they were when Noah lived. ","People were eating
 drinking
 and getting married right up to the day when Noah went into the big boat. Then the flood came and drowned everyone on earth.","When Lot lived
 people were also eating and drinking. They were buying
 selling
 planting
 and building. ","But on the very day Lot left Sodom
 fiery flames poured down from the sky and killed everyone. ","The same will happen on the day when the Son of Man appears.","At that time no one on a rooftop should go down into the house to get anything. No one in a field should go back to the house for anything.","Remember what happened to Lot\u2019s wife.","People who try to save their lives will lose them
 and those who lose their lives will save them. ","On that night two people will be sleeping in the same bed
 but only one will be taken. The other will be left. ","Two women will be together grinding wheat
 but only one will be taken. The other will be left.","Then Jesus' disciples spoke up
 \u201cBut where will this happen
 Lord?\u201d Jesus said
 \u201cWhere there is a corpse
 there will always be buzzards.\u201d","In a town there was once a judge who didn\u2019t fear God or care about people.","In that same town there was a widow who kept going to the judge and saying
 \u201cMake sure that I get fair treatment in court.\u201d","For a while the judge refused to do anything. Finally
 he said to himself
 \u201cEven though I don\u2019t fear God or care about people
 ","I will help this widow because she keeps on bothering me. If I don\u2019t help her
 she will wear me out.\u201d","The Lord said: Think about what that crooked judge said.","Won\u2019t God protect his chosen ones who pray to him day and night? Won\u2019t he be concerned for them?","He will surely hurry and help them. But when the Son of Man comes
 will he find on this earth anyone with faith?","Two men went into the temple to pray. One was a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.","The Pharisee stood over by himself and prayed
 \u201cGod
 I thank you that I am not greedy
 dishonest
 and unfaithful in marriage like other people. And I am really glad that I am not like that tax collector over there. ","I go without eating for two days a week
 and I give you one tenth of all I earn.\u201d","The tax collector stood off at a distance and did not think he was good enough even to look up toward heaven. He was so sorry for what he had done that he pounded his chest and prayed
 \u201cGod
 have pity on me! I am such a sinner.\u201d","Then Jesus said
 \u201cWhen the two men went home
 it was the tax collector and not the Pharisee who was pleasing to God. If you put yourself above others
 you will be put down. But if you humble yourself
 you will be honored.\u201d","So Jesus called the children over to him and said
 \u201cLet the children come to me! Don\u2019t try to stop them. People who are like these children belong to God\u2019s kingdom. ","You will never get into God\u2019s kingdom unless you enter it like a child!\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cWhy do you call me good? Only God is good. ","You know the commandments: \u2018Be faithful in marriage. Do not murder. Do not steal. Do not tell lies about others. Respect your father and mother.\u2019\u201d","He told Jesus
 \u201cI have obeyed all these commandments since I was a young man.\u201d","When Jesus heard this
 he said
 \u201cThere is one thing you still need to do. Go and sell everything you own! Give the money to the poor
 and you will have riches in heaven. Then come and be my follower.\u201d ","Jesus saw how sad the man was. So he said
 \u201cIt\u2019s terribly hard for rich people to get into God\u2019s kingdom! ","In fact
 it\u2019s easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to get into God\u2019s kingdom.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cThere are some things that people cannot do
 but God can do anything.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cYou can be sure that anyone who gives up home or wife or brothers or family or children because of God\u2019s kingdom ","will be given much more in this life. And in the future world they will have eternal life.\u201d","Jesus took the twelve apostles aside and said: We are now on our way to Jerusalem. Everything that the prophets wrote about the Son of Man will happen there.","He will be handed over to foreigners
 who will make fun of him
 mistreat him
 and spit on him. ","They will beat him and kill him
 but three days later he will rise to life.","The apostles did not understand what Jesus was talking about. They could not understand
 because the meaning of what he said was hidden from them.","\u201cWhat do you want me to do for you?\u201d \u201cLord
 I want to see!\u201d he answered.","Jesus replied
 \u201cLook and you will see! Your eyes are healed because of your faith.\u201d ","When Jesus got there
 he looked up and said
 \u201cZacchaeus
 hurry down! I want to stay with you today.\u201d ","Later that day Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord
 \u201cI will give half of my property to the poor. And I will now pay back four times as much to everyone I have ever cheated.\u201d","Jesus said to Zacchaeus
 \u201cToday you and your family have been saved
 because you are a true son of Abraham. ","The Son of Man came to look for and to save people who are lost.\u201d","and Jesus told them this story: A prince once went to a foreign country to be crowned king and then to return.","But before leaving
 he called in ten servants and gave each of them some money. He told them
 \u201cUse this to earn more money until I get back.\u201d","But the people of his country hated him
 and they sent messengers to the foreign country to say
 \u201cWe don\u2019t want this man to be our king.\u201d","After the prince had been made king
 he returned and called in his servants. He asked them how much they had earned with the money they had been given.","The first servant came and said
 \u201cSir
 with the money you gave me I have earned ten times as much.\u201d","\u201cThat\u2019s fine
 my good servant!\u201d the king said. \u201cSince you have shown that you can be trusted with a small amount
 you will be given ten cities to rule.\u201d","The second one came and said
 \u201cSir
 with the money you gave me
 I have earned five times as much.\u201d","The king said
 \u201cYou will be given five cities.\u201d","Another servant came and said
 \u201cSir
 here is your money. I kept it safe in a handkerchief. ","You are a hard man
 and I was afraid of you. You take what isn\u2019t yours
 and you harvest crops you didn\u2019t plant.\u201d","\u201cYou worthless servant!\u201d the king told him. \u201cYou have condemned yourself by what you have just said. You knew that I am a hard man
 taking what isn\u2019t mine and harvesting what I\u2019ve not planted. ","Why didn\u2019t you put my money in the bank? On my return
 I could have had the money together with interest.\u201d","Then he said to some other servants standing there
 \u201cTake the money away from him and give it to the servant who earned ten times as much.\u201d","But they said
 \u201cSir
 he already has ten times as much!\u201d","The king replied
 \u201cThose who have something will be given more. But everything will be taken away from those who don\u2019t have anything. ","Now bring me the enemies who didn\u2019t want me to be their king. Kill them while I watch!\u201d","He told them
 \u201cGo into the next village
 where you will find a young donkey that has never been ridden. Untie the donkey and bring it here. ","If anyone asks why you are doing that
 just say
 \u2018The Lord needs it.\u2019\u201d","Some Pharisees in the crowd said to Jesus

 the time will come when your enemies will build walls around you to attack you. Armies will surround you and close in on you from every side.

 \u201cI want to ask you a question. ","Who gave John the right to baptize? Was it God in heaven or merely some human being?\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cThen I won\u2019t tell you who gave me the right to do what I do.\u201d","Jesus told the people this story: A man once planted a vineyard and rented it out. Then he left the country for a long time.","When it was time to harvest the crop
 he sent a servant to ask the renters for his share of the grapes. But they beat up the servant and sent him away without anything. ","So the owner sent another servant. The renters also beat him up.

 \u201cWhat am I going to do? I know what. I\u2019ll send my son

 they said to one another
 \u201cSomeday he will own the vineyard. Let\u2019s kill him! Then we can have it all for ourselves.\u201d ","So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. Jesus asked
 \u201cWhat do you think the owner of the vineyard will do? ","I\u2019ll tell you what. He will come and kill those renters and let someone else have his vineyard.\u201d When the people heard this
 they said
 \u201cThis must never happen!\u201d","But Jesus looked straight at them and said
 \u201cThen what do the Scriptures mean when they say
 \u2018The stone that the builders tossed aside is now the most important stone of all\u2019? ","Anyone who stumbles over this stone will get hurt
 and anyone it falls on will be smashed to pieces.\u201d","Jesus' enemies kept watching him closely
 because they wanted to hand him over to the Roman governor. So they sent some men who pretended to be good. But they were really spies trying to catch Jesus saying something wrong. ","\u201cShow me a coin.\u201d Then he asked
 \u201cWhose picture and name are on it?\u201d \u201cThe Emperor\u2019s

 \u201cGive the Emperor what belongs to him and give God what belongs to God.\u201d ","Jesus' enemies could not catch him saying anything wrong there in front of the people.

 Moses clearly shows that people will live again. He said
 \u201cThe Lord is the God worshiped by Abraham

 but of the living. This means that everyone is alive as far as God is concerned.","Jesus asked
 \u201cWhy do people say that the Messiah will be the son of King David? ","In the book of Psalms

 \u201cYou can\u2019t force the wedding guests to fast while the groom is still with them
 can you? ","But the time will come when the groom will be taken away from them
 and at that time they will fast.\u201d","Then he told them a parable: \u201cNo one tears a piece of cloth from a new garment and sews it on an old garment. If he does
 the new cloth will tear
 and the piece from the new won\u2019t match the old. ","And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. If he does
 the new wine will make the skins burst
 the wine will be spilled
 and the skins will be ruined. ","Instead
 new wine is to be poured into fresh wineskins. ","No one who has been drinking old wine wants new wine
 because he says
 \u2018The old wine is good enough!\u2019\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cHaven\u2019t you read what David did when he and his companions became hungry? ","How was it that he went into the house of God
 took the Bread of the Presence and ate it
 which was not lawful for anyone but the priests to eat
 and then gave some of it to his companions?\u201d","Then he told them
 \u201cThe Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.\u201d","But Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he told the man with the paralyzed hand
 \u201cGet up
 and stand in the middle of the synagogue.\u201d So he got up and stood there.","Then Jesus asked them
 \u201cI ask you
 is it lawful to do good or to do evil on the Sabbath
 to save a life or to destroy it?\u201d","He looked around at all of them and then told the man
 \u201cHold out your hand.\u201d The man did so
 and his hand was restored to health. ","How blessed are you who are hungry now
 because you will be satisfied! How blessed are you who are crying now
 because you will laugh!","\u201cHow blessed are you whenever people hate you
 avoid you
 insult you
 and slander you because of the Son of Man! ","Rejoice in that day and leap for joy
 because your reward in heaven is great! That\u2019s the way their ancestors used to treat the prophets.","\u201cBut how terrible it will be for you who are rich
 because you have had your comfort!","How terrible it will be for you who are full now
 because you will be hungry! How terrible it will be for you who are laughing now
 because you will mourn and cry!","\u201cHow terrible it will be for you when everyone says nice things about you
 because that\u2019s the way their ancestors used to treat the false prophets!\u201d","\u201cBut I say to you who are listening: Love your enemies. Do good to those who hate you.","Bless those who curse you
 and pray for those who insult you. ","If someone strikes you on the cheek
 offer him the other one as well

 don\u2019t keep back your shirt
 either. ","Keep on giving to everyone who asks you for something
 and if anyone takes what is yours
 do not insist on getting it back. ","Whatever you want people to do for you
 do the same for them.","\u201cIf you love those who love you
 what thanks do you deserve? Why
 even sinners love those who love them. ","If you do good to those who do good to you
 what thanks do you deserve? Even sinners do that. ","If you lend to those from whom you expect to get something back
 what thanks do you deserve? Even sinners lend to sinners to get back what they lend. ","Instead
 love your enemies
 do good to them

 and it will be given to you. A large quantity
 pressed together
 shaken down
 and running over will be put into your lap

\u2019 when you don\u2019t see the beam in your own eye? You hypocrite! First remove the beam from your own eye
 and then you\u2019ll see clearly enough to remove the speck from your brother\u2019s eye.\u201d","\u201cA good tree doesn\u2019t produce rotten fruit
 and a rotten tree doesn\u2019t produce good fruit
 ","because every tree is known by its own fruit. People don\u2019t gather figs from thorny plants or pick grapes from a thorn bush.","A good person produces good from the good treasure of his heart

 Lord
\u2019 but don\u2019t do what I tell you? ","I will show you what everyone is like who comes to me
 hears my words
 and acts on them. ","They are like a person building a house
 who dug a deep hole to lay the foundation on rock. When a flood came
 the floodwaters pushed against that house but couldn\u2019t shake it
 because it had been founded on the rock. ","But the person who hears what I say but doesn\u2019t act on it is like someone who built a house on the ground without any foundation. When the floodwaters pushed against it
 that house quickly collapsed
 and the resulting destruction of that house was extensive.\u201d","When Jesus heard this
 he was amazed at him. Turning to the crowd that was following him
 he said
 \u201cI tell you
 not even in Israel have I found this kind of faith!\u201d ","When the Lord saw her
 he felt compassion for her. He told her
 \u201cYou can stop crying.\u201d ","Then he went up and touched the bier
 and the men who were carrying it stopped. He said
 \u201cYoung man
 I say to you
 get up!\u201d ","So he answered them
 \u201cGo and tell John what you have observed and heard: the blind see
 the lame walk
 lepers are cleansed
 the deaf hear again
 the dead are raised
 and the destitute hear the good news. ","How blessed is anyone who is not offended by me!\u201d","When John\u2019s messengers had gone
 Jesus began to ask the crowds about John. \u201cWhat did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? ","Really
 what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fancy clothes? Look! Those who wear fine clothes and live in luxury are in royal palaces. ","Really
 what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes
 I tell you
 and even more than a prophet! ","This is the man about whom it is written
 \u2018See
 I am sending my messenger ahead of you
 who will prepare your way before you.\u2019","I tell you
 no one has ever been born who is greater than John. Yet even the least important person in the kingdom of God is greater than he.\u201d","Jesus continued
 \u201cTo what may I compare the people living today? ","They\u2019re like little children who sit in the marketplace and shout to each other
 \u2018A wedding song we played for you
 the dance you all did scorn. A woeful dirge we chanted
 too
 but then you would not mourn.\u2019","Because John the Baptist has come neither eating bread nor drinking wine
 yet you say
 \u2018He has a demon!\u2019 ","The Son of Man has come eating and drinking
 and you say
 \u2018Look! He\u2019s a glutton and a drunk
 a friend of tax collectors and sinners!\u2019 ","Wisdom is vindicated by all her children.\u201d","Now the Pharisee who had invited Jesus saw this and told himself
 \u201cIf this man were a prophet
 he would have known who is touching him and what kind of woman she is. She\u2019s a sinner!\u201d","Jesus told him
 \u201cSimon
 I have something to ask you.\u201d \u201cTeacher
\u201d he replied
 \u201cask it.\u201d","\u201cTwo men were in debt to a moneylender. One owed him 500 denarii
 and the other 50. ","When they couldn\u2019t pay it back
 he generously canceled the debts for both of them. Now which of them will love him more?\u201d","Simon answered
 \u201cI suppose the one who had the larger debt canceled.\u201d Jesus told him
 \u201cYou have answered correctly.\u201d","Then
 turning to the woman
 he told Simon
 \u201cDo you see this woman? I came into your house. You didn\u2019t give me any water for my feet
 but this woman has washed my feet with her tears and dried them with her hair. ","You didn\u2019t give me a kiss
 but this woman
 from the moment I came in
 has not stopped kissing my feet. ","You didn\u2019t anoint my head with oil
 but this woman has anointed my feet with perfume. ","So I\u2019m telling you that her sins
 as many as they are
 have been forgiven
 and that\u2019s why she has shown such great love. But the one to whom little is forgiven loves little.\u201d","Then Jesus told her
 \u201cYour sins are forgiven!\u201d","But Jesus told the woman
 \u201cYour faith has saved you. Go in peace.\u201d","Now while a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from every city
 he said in a parable: ","\u201cA farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was sowing
 some seeds fell along the path
 were trampled on
 and birds from the sky ate them up. ","Others fell on stony ground
 and as soon as they came up
 they dried up because they had no moisture. ","Others fell among thorn bushes
 and the thorn bushes grew with them and choked them. ","But others fell on good soil
 and when they came up
 they produced 100 times as much as was planted.\u201d As he said this
 he called out
 \u201cLet the person who has ears to hear
 listen!\u201d","So he said
 \u201cYou have been given knowledge about the secrets of the kingdom of God. But to others they are given in parables
 so that \u2018they might look but not see
 and they might listen but not understand.\u2019\u201d","\u201cNow this is what the parable means. The seed is God\u2019s word.","The ones on the path are the people who listen
 but then the Devil comes and takes the word away from their hearts
 so that they may not believe and be saved. ","The ones on the stony ground are the people who joyfully welcome the word when they hear it. But since they don\u2019t have any roots
 they believe for a while
 but in a time of testing they fall away. ","The ones that fell among the thorn bushes are the people who listen
 but as they go on their way they are choked by the worries
 wealth
 and pleasures of life
 and their fruit doesn\u2019t mature. ","But the ones on the good soil are the people who hear the word but also hold on to it with good and honest hearts
 producing a crop through endurance.\u201d","\u201cNo one lights a lamp and hides it under a bowl or puts it under a bed. Instead
 he puts it on a lamp stand so that those who come in will see the light. ","There is nothing hidden that won\u2019t be revealed
 and there is nothing secret that won\u2019t become known and come to light. ","So pay attention to how you listen
 because to the one who has something
 more will be given. However
 from the one who doesn\u2019t have
 even what he thinks he has will be taken away from him.\u201d","Jesus was told
 \u201cYour mother and your brothers are standing outside and want to see you.\u201d","But he answered those people
 \u201cMy mother and my brothers are those who hear a message from God and heed it.\u201d","One day
 Jesus and his disciples got into a boat. He told them
 \u201cLet\u2019s cross to the other side of the lake.\u201d So they started out.","Then he asked the disciples
 \u201cWhere\u2019s your faith?\u201d Frightened and amazed
 they asked one another
 \u201cWho is this man? He commands even the winds and the water
 and they obey him!\u201d","Jesus asked the man
 \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d He answered
 \u201cLegion
\u201d because many demons had gone into him. ","\u201cGo home and tell what God has done for you.\u201d So the man left and kept proclaiming throughout the whole city how much Jesus had done for him.","Jesus asked
 \u201cWho touched me?\u201d While everyone was denying it
 Peter and those who were with him said
 \u201cMaster
 the crowds are surrounding you and pressing in on you.\u201d","Still Jesus said
 \u201cSomebody touched me
 because I know that power has gone out of me.\u201d","Then he told her
 \u201cDaughter
 your faith has made you well. Go in peace.\u201d","But when Jesus heard this
 he told the synagogue leader
 \u201cStop being afraid! Just believe
 and she will get well.\u201d","Now everyone was crying and wailing for her. But Jesus said
 \u201cStop crying! She\u2019s not dead. She\u2019s sleeping.\u201d ","But he took her hand and called out
 \u201cYoung lady
 get up!\u201d ","He told them
 \u201cDon\u2019t take anything along on your trip\u2014no walking stick
 traveling bag
 bread
 money
 or even an extra shirt. ","When you visit a home and stay there
 and go out from there
 ","if people don\u2019t welcome you
 when you leave that city
 shake its dust off your feet as a testimony against them.\u201d ","But he told them
 \u201cYou give them something to eat.\u201d They replied
 \u201cWe have nothing more than five loaves of bread and two fish\u2014unless we go and buy food for all these people.\u201d","Now there were about 5
000 men. So he told his disciples
 \u201cHave them sit down in groups of about 50.\u201d ","One day
 while Jesus was praying privately and the disciples were with him
 he asked them
 \u201cWho do the crowds say I am?\u201d","He asked them
 \u201cBut who do you say I am?\u201d \u201cGod\u2019s Messiah
\u201d Peter replied.","He said
 \u201cThe Son of Man must suffer a great deal and be rejected by the elders
 the high priests
 and the scribes. Then he must be killed
 but on the third day he will be raised.\u201d","Then he told all of them
 \u201cIf anyone wants to come with me
 he must deny himself
 pick up his cross every day
 and follow me continuously
 ","because whoever wants to save his life will lose it
 but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it. ","What profit will a person have if he gains the whole world
 but destroys himself or is lost? ","If anyone is ashamed of me and my words
 the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his glory and the glory of the Father and the holy angels. ","I tell you with certainty
 some people who are standing here won\u2019t experience death until they see the kingdom of God.\u201d","Just as Moses and Elijah were leaving
 Peter told Jesus
 \u201cMaster
 it\u2019s good that we\u2019re here! Let\u2019s set up three shelters\u2014one for you
 one for Moses
 and one for Elijah.\u201d (Peter didn\u2019t know what he was saying.) ","Jesus answered
 \u201cYou unbelieving and perverted generation! How much longer must I be with you and put up with you? Bring your son here!\u201d ","\u201cListen carefully to these words. The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into human hands.\u201d","Then he told them
 \u201cWhoever welcomes this little child in my name welcomes me
 and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me
 because the one who is least among all of you is the one who is greatest.\u201d","Jesus told him
 \u201cDon\u2019t stop him! Because whoever is not against you is for you.\u201d","Jesus told him
 \u201cFoxes have holes and birds have nests
 but the Son of Man has no place to rest.\u201d","He told another man
 \u201cFollow me.\u201d But he said
 \u201cLord
 first let me go and bury my father.\u201d","But he told him
 \u201cLet the dead bury their own dead. But you go and proclaim the kingdom of God.\u201d","Jesus told him
 \u201cNo one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God.\u201d","So he instructed them
 \u201cThe harvest is vast
 but the workers are few. So ask the Lord of the harvest to send workers out into his harvest. ","Get going! See
 I am sending you out like lambs among wolves. ","Don\u2019t carry a wallet
 a traveling bag
 or sandals
 and don\u2019t greet anyone on the way.","\u201cWhatever house you go into
 first say
 \u2018May there be peace in this house.\u2019 ","If a peaceful person lives there
 your greeting of peace will remain with him. But if that\u2019s not the case
 your greeting will come back to you. ","Stay with the same family
 eating and drinking whatever they provide
 because the worker deserves his pay. Don\u2019t move from house to house.","\u201cWhenever you go into a town and the people welcome you
 eat whatever they serve you
 ","heal the sick that are there
 and tell them
 \u2018The kingdom of God is near you!\u2019 ","But whenever you go into a town and people don\u2019t welcome you
 go out into its streets and say
 ","\u2018We\u2019re wiping off your town\u2019s dust that clings to our feet in protest against you! But realize this: the kingdom of God is near!\u2019","I tell you
 on the last day it will be easier for Sodom than for that town!\u201d","\u201cHow terrible it will be for you
 Chorazin! How terrible it will be for you
 Bethsaida! If the miracles that happened in you had taken place in Tyre and Sidon
 they would have repented long ago
 sitting in sackcloth and ashes. ","It will be easier for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you!","And you
 Capernaum! You won\u2019t be lifted up to heaven
 will you? You\u2019ll go down to Hell! ","The person who listens to you listens to me
 and the person who rejects you rejects me. The person who rejects me rejects the one who sent me.\u201d","He told them
 \u201cI watched Satan falling from heaven like lightning. ","Look! I have given you the authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to destroy all the enemy\u2019s power
 and nothing will ever hurt you. ","However
 stop rejoicing because the spirits are submitting to you. Instead
 rejoice because your names are written in heaven.\u201d","At that moment
 the Holy Spirit made Jesus extremely joyful
 so Jesus said
 \u201cI praise you
 Father
 Lord of heaven and earth
 because you have hidden these things from wise and intelligent people and have revealed them to infants. Yes
 Father
 because this is what was pleasing to you. ","All things have been entrusted to me by my Father. No one knows who the Son is except the Father
 and no one knows who the Father is except the Son and the person to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.\u201d","Then turning to his disciples in private
 he told them
 \u201cHow blessed are the eyes that see what you see! ","Because I tell you
 many prophets and kings wanted to see the things you see but didn\u2019t see them
 and to hear the things you hear but didn\u2019t hear them.\u201d","Just then an expert in the Law stood up to test Jesus. He asked
 \u201cTeacher
 what must I do to inherit eternal life?\u201d","Jesus answered him
 \u201cWhat is written in the Law? What do you read there?\u201d","Jesus told him
 \u201cYou have answered correctly. \u2018Do this
 and you will live.\u2019\u201d","After careful consideration
 Jesus replied
 \u201cA man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho when he fell into the hands of bandits. They stripped him
 beat him
 and went away
 leaving him half dead. ","By chance
 a priest was traveling along that road. When he saw the man
 he went by on the other side. ","Similarly
 a descendant of Levi came to that place. When he saw the man
 he also went by on the other side. ","But as he was traveling along
 a Samaritan came across the man. When the Samaritan saw him
 he was moved with compassion. ","He went to him and bandaged his wounds
 pouring oil and wine on them. Then he put him on his own animal
 brought him to an inn
 and took care of him. ","The next day
 he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper
 saying
 \u2018Take good care of him. If you spend more than that
 I\u2019ll repay you when I come back.\u2019","\u201cOf these three men
 who do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of the bandits?\u201d","He said
 \u201cThe one who showed mercy to him.\u201d Jesus told him
 \u201cGo and do what he did.\u201d","The Lord answered her
 \u201cMartha
 Martha! You worry and fuss about a lot of things. ","But there\u2019s only one thing you need. Mary has chosen what is better
 and it is not to be taken away from her.\u201d","Once Jesus was praying in a certain place. After he had finished
 one of his disciples told him
 \u201cLord
 teach us to pray
 as John taught his disciples.\u201d","So he told them
 \u201cWhenever you pray you are to say
 \u2018Father
 may your name be kept holy. May your kingdom come.","Keep giving us every day our daily bread
","and forgive us our sins
 as we forgive everyone who sins against us. And never bring us into temptation.\u2019\u201d","Then he told them
 \u201cSuppose one of you has a friend
 and you go to him at midnight and say to him
 \u2018Friend
 let me borrow three loaves of bread. ","A friend of mine on a trip has dropped in on me
 and I don\u2019t have anything to serve him.\u2019 ","Suppose he answers from inside
 \u2018Stop bothering me! The door is already locked
 and my children are here with us in the bedroom. I can\u2019t get up and give you anything!\u2019 ","I tell you
 even though that man doesn\u2019t want to get up and give him anything because he is his friend
 he will get up and give him whatever he needs because of his persistence.","So I say to you: Keep asking
 and it will be given you. Keep searching
 and you will find. Keep knocking
 and the door will be opened for you
 ","because everyone who keeps asking will receive
 and the person who keeps searching will find
 and the person who keeps knocking will have the door opened. ","What father among you
 if his son asks for bread
 would give him a stone
 or if he asks for a fish
 would give him a snake instead of the fish? ","Or if he asks for an egg
 would he give him a scorpion? ","So if you who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children
 how much more will the Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who keep asking him!\u201d","Jesus was driving a demon out of a man who was unable to talk. When the demon had gone out
 the man began to speak
 and the crowds were amazed. ","Since he knew what they were thinking
 he told them
 \u201cEvery kingdom divided against itself is devastated
 and a divided household collapses. ","Now
 if Satan is divided against himself
 how can his kingdom last? After all
 you say that I drive out demons by Beelzebul. ","If I drive out demons by Beelzebul
 by whom do your own followers drive them out? That is why they will be your judges! ","But if I drive out demons by the power of God
 then the kingdom of God has come to you.","\u201cWhen a strong man
 fully armed
 guards his own mansion
 his property is safe. ","But when a stronger man than he attacks and defeats him
 the stronger man strips off that man\u2019s armor in which he trusted and then divides his plunder.","\u201cThe person who isn\u2019t with me is against me
 and the person who doesn\u2019t gather with me scatters.\u201d","\u201cWhenever an unclean spirit goes out of a person
 it wanders through dry places looking for a place to rest but doesn\u2019t find any. So it says
 \u2018I will go back to my home that I left.\u2019 ","When it gets back home
 it finds it swept clean and put in order. ","Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more evil than itself
 and they all go in and settle there. And so the final condition of that person is worse than the first.\u201d","As Jesus was saying this
 a woman in the crowd raised her voice and told him
 \u201cHow blessed is the womb that gave birth to you and the breasts that nursed you!\u201d","But he said
 \u201cInstead
 how blessed are those who hear God\u2019s word and obey it!\u201d","Now as the crowds continued to throng around Jesus
 he went on to say
 \u201cThis people living today are an evil generation. It craves a sign
 but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah
 ","because just as Jonah became a sign to the people of Nineveh
 so the Son of Man will be a sign to this generation. ","The queen of the south will stand up at the judgment and condemn the people living today
 because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon. But look
 something greater than Solomon is here! ","The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment and condemn the people living today
 because they repented at the preaching of Jonah. But look
 something greater than Jonah is here!\u201d","\u201cNo one lights a lamp and puts it in a hiding place or under a basket
 but on a lamp stand
 so that those who enter may see its light. ","Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eye is healthy

 be careful that the light in you isn\u2019t darkness. ","Now if your whole body is full of light
 with no part of it in darkness

 \u201cNow you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and the dish

 without neglecting the others.","How terrible it will be for you Pharisees! You love to have the places of honor in the synagogues and to be greeted in the marketplaces.","How terrible it will be for you!

 the people had gathered by the thousands and were trampling on one another. Jesus began to speak first to his disciples. \u201cWatch out for the yeast\u2014that is

 \u201cA man gave a large banquet and invited many people. ","When it was time for the banquet
 he sent his servant to tell those who were invited
 \u2018Come! Everything is now ready.\u2019 ","Every single one of them began asking to be excused. The first told him

 everyone who watches will begin to ridicule him ","and say
 \u2018This person started a building but couldn\u2019t finish it.\u2019","\u201cOr suppose a king is going to war against another king. He will first sit down and consider whether with 10

 salt is good. But if the salt should lose its taste

 the younger son gathered everything he owned and traveled to a distant country. There he wasted it all on wild living. ","After he had spent everything
 a severe famine took place throughout that country
 and he began to be in need. ","So he went out to work for one of the citizens of that country

 I have sinned against heaven and you. I don\u2019t deserve to be called your son anymore.\u2019 ","But the father told his servants
 \u2018Hurry! Bring out the best robe and put it on him

 the beggar died and was carried away by the angels to Abraham\u2019s side. The rich man also died and was buried. ","In the afterlife

 I will grant her justice. Otherwise
 she will keep coming and wear me out.\u2019\u201d","Then the Lord added
 \u201cListen to what the unrighteous judge says. ","Won\u2019t God grant his chosen people justice when they cry out to him day and night? Is he slow to help them?","I tell you
 he will give them justice quickly. But when the Son of Man comes
 will he find faith on earth?\u201d","\u201cTwo men went up to the Temple to pray. One was a Pharisee
 and the other was a tax collector. ","The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed
 \u2018O God
 I thank you that I\u2019m not like other people\u2014thieves
 dishonest people
 adulterers
 or even this tax collector. ","I fast twice a week
 and I give a tenth of my entire income.\u2019","\u201cBut the tax collector stood at a distance and would not even look up to heaven. Instead
 he continued to beat his chest and said
 \u2018O God
 be merciful to me
 the sinner that I am!\u2019 ","I tell you
 this man
 rather than the other one
 went down to his home justified
 because everyone who exalts himself will be humbled
 but the person who humbles himself will be exalted.\u201d","Jesus
 however
 called for the children and said
 \u201cLet the little children come to me
 and stop keeping them away
 because the kingdom of God belongs to people like these. ","I tell all of you with certainty
 whoever doesn\u2019t receive the kingdom of God as a little child will never get into it at all.\u201d","\u201cWhy do you call me good?\u201d Jesus asked him. \u201cNobody is good except for one\u2014God.","You know the commandments: \u2018Never commit adultery. Never murder. Never steal. Never give false testimony. Honor your father and mother.\u2019\u201d","The official replied
 \u201cI have kept all of these since I was a young man.\u201d","When Jesus heard this
 he told him
 \u201cYou still need to do one thing. Sell everything you have and give the money to the destitute
 and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come back and follow me.\u201d ","So when Jesus saw how sad he was
 he said
 \u201cHow hard it is for rich people to get into the kingdom of God! ","Indeed
 it\u2019s easier for a camel to squeeze through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to get into the kingdom of God.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cThe things that are impossible for people are possible for God.\u201d","Jesus told them
 \u201cI tell all of you with certainty
 there is no one who has left his home
 wife
 brothers
 parents
 or children because of the kingdom of God ","who will not receive many times as much in this world
 as well as eternal life in the age to come.\u201d","Jesus took the Twelve aside and told them
 \u201cPay attention! We\u2019re going up to Jerusalem. Everything written by the prophets about the Son of Man will be fulfilled
 ","because he\u2019ll be handed over to the unbelievers
 and will be mocked
 insulted
 and spit on. ","After they have whipped him
 they\u2019ll kill him
 but on the third day he\u2019ll rise again.\u201d ","But they didn\u2019t understand any of this. What he said was hidden from them
 and they didn\u2019t know what he meant.","\u201cWhat do you want me to do for you?\u201d He said
 \u201cLord
 I want to see again!\u201d","So Jesus told him
 \u201cSee again! Your faith has made you well.\u201d ","When Jesus came to the tree
 he looked up and said
 \u201cZacchaeus
 hurry and come down! I must stay at your house today.\u201d ","Later
 Zacchaeus stood up and announced to the Lord
 \u201cLook! I\u2019m giving half of my possessions to the destitute
 and if I have accused anyone falsely
 I\u2019m repaying four times as much as I owe.\u201d","Then Jesus told him
 \u201cToday salvation has come to this home
 because this man is also a descendant of Abraham
 ","and the Son of Man has come to seek and to save the lost.\u201d","So he said
 \u201cA prince went to a distant country to be appointed king and then to return. ","He called ten of his servants and gave them ten coins. He told them
 \u2018Invest this money until I come back.\u2019 ","But the citizens of his country hated him and sent a delegation to follow him and to announce
 \u2018We don\u2019t want this man to rule over us!\u2019","\u201cAfter he was appointed king
 the prince came back. He ordered the servants to whom he had given the money to be called so he could find out what they had earned by investing. ","The first servant came and said
 \u2018Sir
 your coin has earned ten more coins.\u2019 ","The king told him
 \u2018Well done
 good servant! Because you have been trustworthy in a very small thing
 take charge of ten cities.\u2019","\u201cThe second servant came and said
 \u2018Your coin
 sir
 has earned five coins.\u2019 ","The king told him
 \u2018You take charge of five cities.\u2019","\u201cThen the other servant came and said
 \u2018Sir
 look! Here\u2019s your coin. I\u2019ve kept it in a cloth for safekeeping ","because I was afraid of you. You are a hard man. You withdraw what you didn\u2019t deposit and harvest what you didn\u2019t plant.\u2019","The king told him
 \u2018I will judge you by your own words
 you evil servant! You knew
 did you
 that I was a hard man
 and that I withdraw what I didn\u2019t deposit and harvest what I didn\u2019t plant? ","Then why didn\u2019t you put my money in the bank? When I returned
 I could have collected it with interest.\u2019","\u201cSo the king told those standing nearby
 \u2018Take the coin away from him and give it to the man who has the ten coins.\u2019 ","They answered him
 \u2018Sir
 he already has ten coins!\u2019 ","\u2018I tell you
 to everyone who has something
 more will be given
 but from the person who has nothing
 even what he has will be taken away. ","But as for these enemies of mine who didn\u2019t want me to be their king\u2014bring them here and slaughter them in my presence!\u2019\u201d","\u201cGo into the village ahead of you
\u201d he said. \u201cAs you enter
 you will find a colt tied up that no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it along. ","If anyone asks you why you are untying it
 say this: \u2018The Lord needs it.\u2019\u201d","Some of the Pharisees in the crowd told Jesus
 \u201cTeacher
 tell your disciples to be quiet.\u201d","He replied
 \u201cI tell you
 if they were quiet
 the stones would cry out!\u201d","\u201cIf you had only known today what could have brought you peace! But now it is hidden from your sight
 ","because the days will come when your enemies will build walls around you
 surround you
 and close you in on every side. ","They will level you to the ground\u2014you and those who live within your city limits. They will not leave one stone on another within your walls
 because you didn\u2019t recognize the time when you were visited.\u201d","He told them
 \u201cIt is written
 \u2018My house is to be called a house of prayer
\u2019 but you have turned it into a hideout for bandits!\u201d","He answered them
 \u201cI
 too
 will ask you a question. Tell me: ","Was John\u2019s authority to baptize from heaven or from humans?\u201d","Then Jesus told them
 \u201cThen I won\u2019t tell you by what authority I\u2019m doing these things.\u201d","Then he began to tell the people this parable: \u201cA man planted a vineyard
 leased it to tenant farmers
 and went abroad for a long time. ","At the right time he sent a servant to the farmers in order to get his share of the produce of the vineyard. But the farmers beat him and sent him back empty-handed.","He sent another servant
 and they beat him
 too
 treated him shamefully
 and sent him back empty-handed. ","Then he sent a third
 and they wounded him and threw him out
 too.","\u201cThen the owner of the vineyard said
 \u2018What should I do? I\u2019ll send my son whom I love. Maybe they\u2019ll respect him.\u2019 ","But when the farmers saw him
 they talked it over among themselves and said
 \u2018This is the heir. Let\u2019s kill him so that the inheritance will be ours!\u2019 ","So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. Now what will the owner of the vineyard do to them?","He will come and destroy those farmers and give the vineyard to others.\u201d Those who heard him said
 \u201cThat must never happen!\u201d","But Jesus looked at them and asked
 \u201cWhat does this text mean: \u2018The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone\u2019?","Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces
 and it will crush anyone on whom it falls.\u201d","So they watched him closely and sent spies who pretended to be honest men in order to trap him in what he would say. They wanted to hand him over to the jurisdiction of the governor
 ","\u201cShow me a denarius. Whose face and name does it have?\u201d \u201cCaesar\u2019s
\u201d they replied.","So he told them
 \u201cThen give back to Caesar the things that are Caesar\u2019s
 and to God the things that are God\u2019s.\u201d","So they couldn\u2019t catch him before the people in what he said. Amazed at his answer
 they became silent.","Jesus told them
 \u201cThose who belong to this age marry and are married
 ","but those who are considered worthy of a place in that age and in the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage.","Nor can they die anymore
 because they are like the angels and
 since they share in the resurrection
 are God\u2019s children. ","Even Moses demonstrated in the story about the bush that the dead are raised
 when he calls the Lord
 \u2018the God of Abraham
 the God of Isaac
 and the God of Jacob.\u2019 ","He is not the God of the dead
 but of the living
 because he considers all people to be alive to him.\u201d","Then he asked them
 \u201cHow can people say that the Messiah is David\u2019s son? ","Because David himself in the book of Psalms says
 \u2018The Lord told my Lord
 \u201cSit at my right hand
","until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.\u201d\u2019","So David calls him \u2018Lord.\u2019 Then how can he be his son?\u201d","\u201cBeware of the scribes! They like to walk around in long robes and love to be greeted in the marketplaces and to have the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets.","They devour widows\u2019 houses and say long prayers to cover it up. They will receive greater condemnation!\u201d","He said
 \u201cI tell you with certainty
 this destitute widow has dropped in more than all of them
 ","because all the others contributed to the offering out of their surplus
 but she
 in her poverty
 dropped in everything she had to live on.\u201d","\u201cAs for these things that you\u2019re seeing
 the time will come when not one stone will be left on another that won\u2019t be completely demolished.\u201d","He said
 \u201cSee to it that you aren\u2019t deceived
 because many will come in my name
 proclaiming
 \u2018I AM
\u2019 and
 \u2018The time has come.\u2019 Don\u2019t follow them. ","But when you hear of wars and revolutions
 don\u2019t ever be terrified
 because these sorts of things must take place first
 but the end won\u2019t come right away.\u201d","Then he went on to say to them
 \u201cNation will rise up in arms against nation
 and kingdom against kingdom. ","In addition there will be great earthquakes
 famines
 and plagues in various places
 as well as terrifying events
 including significant signs from heaven.\u201d","\u201cBut before all these things
 people will arrest you and persecute you. They will hand you over to synagogues and prisons
 and you will be brought before kings and governors for my name\u2019s sake
 ","in order to give you an opportunity to testify.","So purpose in your hearts not to prepare your defense ahead of time
 ","because I will give you the ability to speak
 along with wisdom
 that none of your opponents will be able to resist or refute. ","You will be betrayed even by parents
 brothers
 relatives
 and friends
 and they will put some of you to death. ","You will be hated continuously by everyone on account of my name.","And yet not a hair on your head will be lost.","But the person who endures to the end will be saved.\u201d","\u201cSo when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies
 then understand that its devastation is approaching. ","Then those in Judea must flee to the mountains
 those inside the city must leave it
 and those in the countryside must not go into it
 ","because these are the days of vengeance when all that is written will be fulfilled.","\u201cHow terrible it will be for those women who are pregnant or who are nursing babies in those days!\u2014because there will be great distress in the land and wrath against this people.","They will fall by the edge of the sword and be carried off as captives among all the nations
 and Jerusalem will be trampled on by unbelievers until the times of the unbelievers are fulfilled.\u201d","\u201cThere will be signs in the sun
 the moon
 and the stars
 and there will be distress on earth among the nations that are confused by the roaring of the sea and its waves. ","People will faint from fear and apprehension because of what\u2019s to be coming to the inhabited world
 because the powers of the heavens will be disrupted. ","Then people will see \u2018the Son of Man coming in a cloud\u2019 with power and great glory.","\u201cNow when these things begin to take place
 stand up and lift up your heads
 because your deliverance is approaching.\u201d","Then he told them a parable: \u201cLook at the fig tree and all the trees.","As soon as they produce leaves
 you can see for yourselves and know that summer is already approaching. ","In the same way
 when you see these things taking place
 you will know that the kingdom of God is near. ","I tell all of you with certainty
 this generation won\u2019t disappear until all these things take place. ","Heaven and earth will disappear
 but my words won\u2019t ever disappear.\u201d","\u201cConstantly be on your guard so that your hearts will not be loaded down with self-indulgence
 drunkenness
 and the worries of this life
 or that day will take you by surprise ","like a trap
 because it will come on everyone who lives on the face of the earth. ","So be alert at all times
 praying that you may have strength to escape all these things that are going to take place and to take your stand in the presence of the Son of Man.\u201d","So Jesus sent Peter and John
 saying
 \u201cGo and make preparations for us to eat the Passover meal.\u201d","He told them
 \u201cJust after you go into the city
 a man carrying a jug of water will meet you. Follow him into the house he enters ","and say to the owner of the house
 \u2018The Teacher asks you
 \u201cWhere is the room where I can eat the Passover meal with my disciples?\u201d\u2019 ","Then he will show you a large upstairs room that is furnished. Get things ready for us there.\u201d","He told them
 \u201cI have eagerly desired to eat this Passover meal with you before I suffer
 ","because I tell all of you
 I will never eat it again until it finds its fulfillment in the kingdom of God.\u201d","Then he took a cup
 gave thanks
 and said
 \u201cTake this and share it among yourselves
 ","because I tell you
 from now on I will never drink the product of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.\u201d","Then he took a loaf of bread
 gave thanks
 broke it in pieces
 and handed it to them
 saying
 \u201cThis is my body
 which is given for you. Keep on doing this in memory of me.\u201d","He did the same with the cup after supper
 saying
 \u201cThis cup is the new covenant sealed by my blood
 which is being poured out for you. ","Yet look! The hand of the man who is betraying me is with me on the table!","The Son of Man is going away
 just as it has been determined
 but how terrible it will be for that man by whom he is betrayed!\u201d ","But he told them
 \u201cThe kings of the unbelievers lord it over them
 and those who exercise authority over them are called benefactors. ","But you are not to do so. On the contrary
 the greatest among you should become like the youngest
 and the one who leads should become like the one who serves. ","Because who is greater
 the one who sits at the table
 or the one who serves? It is the one at the table
 isn\u2019t it? But I\u2019m among you as one who serves.","\u201cYou are the ones who have always stood by me in my trials.","And I confer a kingdom on you
 just as my Father has conferred a kingdom on me
 ","so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit down on thrones to govern the twelve tribes of Israel.\u201d","\u201cSimon
 Simon
 listen! Satan has asked permission to sift all of you like wheat
 ","but I have prayed for you that your own faith may not fail. When you have come back
 you must strengthen your brothers.\u201d","Peter told him
 \u201cLord
 I am ready to go even to prison and to die with you!\u201d","But Jesus said
 \u201cI tell you
 Peter
 the rooster will not crow today until you deny three times that you know me.\u201d","Then Jesus asked his disciples
 \u201cWhen I sent you out without a wallet
 traveling bag
 or sandals
 you didn\u2019t lack anything
 did you?\u201d They replied
 \u201cNothing at all.\u201d","Then he told them
 \u201cBut now whoever has a wallet must take it along
 and his traveling bag
 too. And the one who has no sword must sell his coat and buy one. ","Because I tell you
 what has been written about me must be fulfilled: \u2018He was counted among the criminals.\u2019 Indeed
 what is written about me must be fulfilled.\u201d","So they said
 \u201cLord
 look! Here are two swords.\u201d He answered them
 \u201cEnough of that!\u201d","When he arrived
 he told them
 \u201cKeep on praying that you may not be tempted.\u201d ","\u201cFather
 if you are willing
 take this cup away from me. Yet not my will but yours be done.\u201d","He asked them
 \u201cWhy are you sleeping? Get up and keep on praying that you may not be tempted.\u201d","But Jesus asked him
 \u201cJudas
 are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?\u201d","But Jesus said
 \u201cNo more of this!\u201d So he touched the wounded man\u2019s ear and healed him.","Then Jesus told the high priests
 the Temple police
 and the elders
 who had come for him
 \u201cHave you come out with swords and clubs as if I were a bandit? ","While I was with you day after day in the Temple
 you didn\u2019t lay a hand on me. But this is your hour
 when darkness reigns!\u201d","Then the Lord turned and looked straight at Peter. And Peter remembered the word from the Lord
 and how he had told him
 \u201cBefore a rooster crows today
 you will deny me three times.\u201d ","They said
 \u201cIf you are the Messiah
 tell us.\u201d But he told them
 \u201cIf I tell you
 you won\u2019t believe me
 ","and if I ask you a question
 you won\u2019t answer me. ","But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the mighty God.\u201d","Then they all asked
 \u201cAre you
 then
 the Son of God?\u201d He answered them
 \u201cYou said it\u2014I AM.\u201d","Then Pilate asked him
 \u201cAre you the king of the Jews?\u201d He answered
 \u201cYou say so.\u201d","When Pilate heard this
 he asked whether the man was a Galilean. ","and told them
 \u201cYou brought this man to me as one who turns the people against the government.

I have found nothing in him worthy of death. So I will punish him and let him go.\u201d","But Jesus turned to them and said
 \u201cWomen of Jerusalem
 stop crying for me. Instead
 cry for yourselves and for your children
 ","because the time is surely coming when people will say
 \u2018How blessed are the women who couldn\u2019t bear children and the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed!\u2019 ","Then people will begin to say to the mountains
 \u2018Fall on us!\u2019

 \u2018Cover us up!\u2019 ","And if they do this when the wood is green
 what will happen when it is dry?\u201d","Jesus kept saying
 \u201cFather
 forgive them

 \u201cI tell you with certainty
 today you will be with me in Paradise.\u201d","Then Jesus cried out with a loud voice and said
 \u201cFather
 into your hands I entrust my spirit.\u201d After he said this
 he breathed his last.","While the women remained terrified
 bowing their faces to the ground
 the men asked them
 \u201cWhy are you looking among the dead for someone who is living? ","He asked them
 \u201cWhat are you discussing with each other as you\u2019re walking along?\u201d They stood still and looked gloomy.","He asked them
 \u201cWhat things?\u201d They answered him
 \u201cThe events involving Jesus of Nazareth
 who was a prophet
 mighty in what he said and did before God and all the people
 ","Then Jesus told them
 \u201cO
 how foolish you are! How slow you are to believe everything the prophets said! ","The Messiah had to suffer these things and then enter his glory
 didn\u2019t he?\u201d ","While they were all talking about this
 Jesus himself stood among them and told them
 \u201cPeace be with you.\u201d","But Jesus told them
 \u201cWhat\u2019s frightening you? And why are you doubting? ","Look at my hands and my feet
 because it\u2019s really me. Touch me and look at me
 because a ghost doesn\u2019t have flesh and bones as you see that I have.\u201d ","Even though they were still skeptical due to their joy and astonishment
 Jesus asked them
 \u201cDo you have anything here to eat?\u201d","Then he told them
 \u201cThese are the words that I spoke to you while I was still with you\u2014that everything written about me in the Law of Moses
 the Prophets
 and the Psalms had to be fulfilled.\u201d","He told them
 \u201cThis is how it is written: the Messiah was to suffer and rise from the dead on the third day
 ","and then repentance and forgiveness of sins is to be proclaimed in his name to all the nations
 beginning at Jerusalem. ","You are witnesses of these things.","I am sending to you what my Father promised
 so stay here in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high.\u201d","And he said unto them
 How is it that ye sought me? Knew ye not that it behooves me to be about my Father\u2019s business?","And Jesus answered him
 saying
 It is written
 That man shall not live by bread alone
 but by every word of God.","And the devil said unto him
 All this authority I will give thee and the glory of them
 for that is delivered unto me
 and to whomsoever I will I give it.","And Jesus answered and said unto him
 Get thee behind me
 Satan; for it is written
 Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God
 and him only shalt thou serve.","And he brought him to Jerusalem and set him on a pinnacle of the temple and said unto him
 If thou art the Son of God
 cast thyself down from here;","And Jesus answering said unto him
 It is said
 Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.","The Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted
 to proclaim liberty to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind
 to set at liberty those that are broken
","to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.","And he began to say unto them
 Today this scripture is fulfilled in your ears.","And he said unto them
 Ye will surely say unto me this proverb
 Physician
 heal thyself; whatever we have heard done in Capernaum
 do also here in thy country.","And he said
 Verily I say unto you
 No prophet is accepted in his own country.","But I tell you of a truth
 many widows were in Israel in the days of Elijah
 when the heaven was shut up three years and six months
 when great famine was throughout all the land
","but unto none of them was Elijah sent
 except unto Sarepta
 a city of Sidon
 unto a widow woman.","And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet
 and none of them was cleansed
 except Naaman the Syrian.","And they were astonished at his doctrine
 for his word was with power.","And Jesus rebuked him
 saying
 Be silent and come out of him. And the demon
 throwing him down in the midst
 came out of him and hurt him not.","And demons also came out of many
 crying out and saying
 Thou art the Christ
 the Son of God. And he rebuking them suffered them not to speak
 for they knew that he was the Christ.","And he said unto them
 I must announce the gospel of the kingdom of God to other cities also because for this am I sent.","Now when he had left speaking
 he said unto Simon
 Launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.","and likewise James and John
 the sons of Zebedee
 who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon
 Fear not; from now on thou shalt catch men.","And he put forth his hand and touched him
 saying
 I will; be thou clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him.","And he charged him to tell no one. But go and show thyself to the priest and offer for thy cleansing
 according as Moses commanded
 for a testimony unto them.","And when he saw their faith
 he said unto him
 Man
 thy sins are forgiven thee.","Then Jesus
 knowing their thoughts and answering them said
 What reason ye in your hearts?","What is easier
 to say
 Thy sins are forgiven thee
 or to say
 Rise up and walk?","But that ye may know that the Son of man has power upon earth to forgive sins (he said unto the paralytic)
 I say unto thee
 Arise and take up thy couch and go to thine house.","And after these things he went forth and saw a publican
 named Levi
 sitting at the receipt of custom
 and he said unto him
 Follow me.","And Jesus answering said unto them
 Those that are whole have no need of a physician
 but those that are sick.","I came not to call the righteous
 but sinners to repentance.","Then they said unto him
 Why do the disciples of John fast often and make prayers and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees
 but thine eat and drink?","And he said unto them
 Can ye make the sons of the bridechamber fast while the bridegroom is with them?","But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them
 and then shall they fast in those days.","And he also spoke a parable unto them: No one takes a piece of a new garment to mend an old one; if otherwise
 then the new one is rent
 and the piece that was taken out of the new does not agree with the old.","And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; or else the new wine will burst the wineskins and be spilled and the wineskins shall perish.","But new wine must be put into new wineskins
 and both are preserved.","No one also having drunk of the old straightway desires the new
 for he says
 The old is better.","And Jesus answering them said
 Have ye not read so much as this
 what David did
 when he and those that were with him were hungry
","how he went into the house of God and did take and eat the showbread and gave also to those that were with him
 which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone?","And he said unto them
 The Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath.","But he knew their thoughts and said to the man who had the withered hand
 Rise up and stand forth in the midst. And he arose and stood forth.","Then said Jesus unto them
 I will ask you one thing: Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good or to do evil? to save a person or to destroy them?","And looking round about upon them all
 he said unto the man
 Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so
 and his hand was restored whole as the other.","Blessed are those that hunger now
 for ye shall be filled. Blessed are those that weep now
 for ye shall laugh.","Blessed are ye when men shall hate you and when they shall separate you from their company and shall reproach you and cast out your name as evil for the sake of the Son of man.","Rejoice ye in that day and leap for joy; for
 behold
 your reward is great in heaven
 for their fathers treated the prophets in the same manner.","But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation.","Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.","Woe unto you when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers treat the false prophets.","But I say unto you who hear
 Love your enemies
 do good to those who hate you
","bless those that curse you
 and pray for those who despitefully use you.","And unto the one that smites thee on the one cheek offer also the other
 and to the one that takes away thy cloak defend not thy coat also.","Give to everyone that asks of thee
 and of the one that takes away thy goods ask them not to return them.","And as ye desire that men should do to you
 do ye also to them likewise.","For if ye love those who love you
 what grace shall ye have? for sinners also love those that love them.","And if ye do good to those who do good to you
 what grace shall ye have? for sinners also do even the same.","And if ye lend to those of whom ye hope to receive
 what grace shall ye have? for sinners also lend to sinners to receive as much again.","But rather love ye your enemies and do good and lend
 hoping for nothing again
 and your reward shall be great; and ye shall be the sons of the Most High
 for he is kind even unto the unthankful and to the evil.","Be ye therefore merciful
 as your Father also is merciful.","Judge not
 and ye shall not be judged; condemn not
 and ye shall not be condemned; forgive
 and ye shall be forgiven;","give
 and it shall be given unto you; good measure
 pressed down and shaken together and running over
 shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye measure out it shall be measured to you again.","And he spoke a parable unto them
 Can the blind lead the blind? Shall they not both fall into the pit?","The disciple is not above his master
 but any one that is as the master shall be perfect.","And why dost thou behold the mote that is in thy brother\u2019s eye
 but not perceive the beam that is in thine own eye?","Or how canst thou say to thy brother
 Brother
 let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye
 when thou thyself dost not behold the beam that is in thine own eye? Hypocrite
 cast out first the beam out of thine own eye
 and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother\u2019s eye.","For a good tree does not bring forth corrupt fruit; neither does a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.","For every tree is known by its own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs
 nor of a bramble bush do they gather grapes.","The good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth that which is good
 and the evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings forth that which is evil
 for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.","And why call ye me
 Lord
 Lord
 and do not the things which I say?","Whosoever comes to me and hears my words and does them
 I will show you to whom he is like:","he is like a man who built a house and dug deep and laid the foundation upon rock; and when the flood arose
 the river beat vehemently upon that house and could not shake it
 for it was founded upon rock.","But he that hears and does not do is like a man that built a house upon the earth without a foundation against which the river beat vehemently
 and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.","When Jesus heard these things
 he marvelled at him and turned about and said unto the people that followed him
 I say unto you that not even in Israel have I found such great faith.","And when the Lord saw her
 he had compassion on her and said unto her
 Weep not.","And he came and touched the bier
 and those that bore him stood still. And he said
 Young man
 I say unto thee
 Arise.","Then Jesus answering said unto them
 Go and tell John the things ye have seen and heard: how the blind see
 the lame walk
 the lepers are cleansed
 the deaf hear
 the dead are raised
 to the poor the gospel is preached;","and blessed is whoever shall not be offended in me.","And when the messengers of John were departed
 he began to speak unto the people concerning John
 What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?","But what went ye out to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold
 those that are gorgeously apparelled and live delicately are in kings\u2019 courts.","But what went ye out to see? A prophet? Yea
 I say unto you
 and much more than a prophet.","This is he of whom it is written
 Behold
 I send my messenger before thy face
 who shall prepare thy way before thee.","For I say unto you
 Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist
 but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.","And the Lord said
 Unto whom then shall I compare the men of this generation? and to what are they like?","They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace and calling one to another and saying
 We have piped unto you
 and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you
 and ye have not wept.","For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine
 and ye say
 He has a demon.","The Son of man is come eating and drinking
 and ye say
 Behold a gluttonous man and a winebibber
 a friend of publicans and sinners!","But wisdom is justified of all her children.","Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw it
 he spoke within himself
 saying
 This man
 if he were a prophet
 would have known who and what manner of woman this is that touches him
 for she is a sinner.","And Jesus answering said unto him
 Simon
 I have something to say unto thee. And he said
 Master
 say on.","There was a certain creditor who had two debtors: the one owed five hundred denarius
 and the other fifty.","And when they had nothing to pay
 he released them both from their debt. Tell me therefore
 which of them will love him most?","Simon answered and said
 I suppose that he to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him
 Thou hast rightly judged.","And he turned to the woman and said unto Simon
 Seest thou this woman? I entered into thy house
 thou didst give me no water for my feet; but she has washed my feet with tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head.","Thou gavest me no kiss; but this woman since the time I came in has not ceased to kiss my feet.","Thou didst not anoint my head with oil; but this woman has anointed my feet with ointment.","Therefore I say unto thee
 Her sins
 which are many
 are forgiven; for she loved much; but to whom little is forgiven
 the same loves little.","And he said unto her
 Thy sins are forgiven.","And he said to the woman
 Thy faith has saved thee; go in peace.","And when many people were gathered together and were come to him out of every city
 he spoke by a parable:","A sower went out to sow his seed
 and as he sowed
 some fell along the way
 and it was trodden down
 and the fowls of the air devoured it.","And some fell upon the rock
 and as soon as it was sprung up
 it withered away because it lacked moisture.","And some fell among thorns
 and the thorns sprang up with it and choked it.","And some fell on good ground and sprang up and bore fruit a hundredfold. And when he had said these things
 he cried
 He that has ears to hear
 let him hear.","And he said
 Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God
 but to the others in parables that seeing they might not see and hearing they might not understand.","Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.","Those along the way are those that hear; then comes the devil and takes away the word out of their hearts
 lest they should believe and be saved.","Those on the rock are those that when they hear
 receive the word with joy
 but these have no root
 who for a while believe and in time of temptation fall away.","And that which fell among thorns are those who when they have heard go forth and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life and bring no fruit to perfection.","But that on the good ground are those who in an honest and good heart
 having heard the word
 keep it and bring forth fruit with patience.","No one when they have lighted a lamp cover it with a vessel or put it under a bed
 but set it on a lampstand
 that those who enter in may see the light.","For nothing is secret that shall not be made manifest
 neither any thing hid that shall not be known and come to light.","Take heed therefore how ye hear
 for whosoever has
 to him shall be given; and whosoever has not
 from him shall be taken even that which he seems to have.","And it was told him by certain who said
 Thy mother and thy brethren stand outside
 desiring to see thee.","And he answered and said unto them
 My mother and my brethren are those who hear the word of God and do it.","Now it came to pass on a certain day
 that he went into a ship with his disciples
 and he said unto them
 Let us go over unto the other side of the lake. And they launched forth.","And he said unto them
 Where is your faith? And they
 being afraid
 wondered
 saying one to another
 Who is this! for he even commands the winds and the water
 and they obey him.","And Jesus asked him
 saying
 What is thy name? And he said
 Legion
 because many demons were entered into him.","Return to thine own house and tell what great things God has done unto thee. And he went
 preaching throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done unto him.","Then Jesus said
 Who touched me? When all denied
 Peter and those that were with him said
 Master
 the multitude throng thee and press thee
 and sayest thou
 Who touched me?","And Jesus said
 Someone has touched me
 for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.","And he said unto her
 Daughter
 be of good comfort; thy faith has made thee whole; go in peace.","But when Jesus heard it
 he answered him
 saying
 Fear not; only believe
 and she shall be made whole.","And all wept and bewailed her
 but he said
 Weep not; she is not dead
 but sleeps.","And he put them all out and took her by the hand and called
 saying
 Maid
 arise.","And he said unto them
 Take nothing for your journey: neither staves nor provision bag
 neither bread
 neither money
 neither have two coats apiece.","And whatever house ye enter into
 abide there and depart from there.","And whosoever will not receive you
 when ye go out of that city
 shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them.","But he said unto them
 Give ye them to eat. And they said
 We have no more than five loaves and two fishes
 unless we should go and buy food for all these people.","For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples
 Make them sit down in companies of fifty.","And it came to pass as he was alone praying
 his disciples were with him
 and he asked them
 saying
 Who do the people say that I am?","He said unto them
 But who do ye say that I am? Peter answering said
 The Christ of God.","saying
 The Son of man must suffer many things and be rejected of the elders and of the princes of the priests and scribes and be slain and be raised the third day.","And he said to them all
 If anyone will come after me
 let them deny themself and take up their cross {Gr. stauros \u2013 stake} daily and follow me.","For whosoever desires to save his soul shall lose it
 but whosoever will lose his soul for my sake
 the same shall save it.","For what is a man advantaged if he gains the whole world
 having destroyed himself or having suffered the loss of himself?","For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words
 of him shall the Son of man be ashamed when he shall come in his own glory and in his Father\u2019s and of the holy angels.","But I tell you in truth
 there are some standing here who shall not taste of death until they see the kingdom of God.","And it came to pass as they departed from him
 Peter said unto Jesus
 Master
 it is good for us to remain here; and let us make three tabernacles: one for thee and one for Moses and one for Elijah
 not knowing what he said.","And Jesus answering said
 O faithless and perverse generation
 how long shall I be with you and suffer you? Bring thy son here.","Let these words sink down into your ears
 for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men.","and said unto them
 Whosoever shall receive this child in my name receives me
 and whosoever shall receive me receives him that sent me; for he that is least among you all
 the same shall be great.","And Jesus said unto him
 Forbid him not
 for he that is not against us is for us.","And Jesus said unto him
 Foxes have holes
 and birds of the heaven have nests
 but the Son of man has not where to lay his head.","And he said unto another
 Follow me. But he said
 Lord
 allow me first to go and bury my father.","Jesus said unto him
 Let the dead bury their dead
 but go thou and declare the kingdom of God.","And Jesus said unto him
 No one having put his hand to the plough and looking back is fit for the kingdom of God.","Therefore he said unto them
 The harvest truly is great
 but the labourers are few; pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that he would send forth labourers into his harvest.","Go; behold
 I send you forth as lambs among wolves.","Carry neither purse nor provision bag nor shoes
 and greet no one on the way.","And into whatever house ye enter
 first say
 Peace be to this house.","And if indeed there is a son of peace there
 your peace shall rest upon it; if not
 it shall turn to you again.","And in the same house remain
 eating and drinking such things as they give
 for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house.","And into whatever city ye enter and they receive you
 eat such things as are set before you","and heal the sick that are therein and say unto them
 The kingdom of God is come near unto you.","But into whatever city ye enter and they receive you not
 go out into the streets of the same and say
","Even the very dust of your city which cleaves on us we do wipe off against you; notwithstanding be ye sure of this that the kingdom of God is come near unto you.","But I say unto you that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom than for that city.","Woe unto thee
 Chorazin! woe unto thee
 Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which have been done in you
 they would have repented a long while ago
 sitting in sackcloth and ashes.","Therefore it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you.","And thou
 Capernaum
 which art exalted unto the heavens
 shalt be thrust down to Hades.","He that hears you hears me
 and he that despises you despises me
 and he that despises me despises him that sent me.","And he said unto them
 I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.","Behold
 I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy
 and nothing shall by any means hurt you.","Notwithstanding
 rejoice not in this
 that the spirits are subject unto you
 but rather rejoice because your names are written in the heavens.","In that same hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit and said
 I thank thee
 O Father
 Lord of heaven and earth
 that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and hast revealed them unto babes; even so
 Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight.","All things are delivered to me of my Father
 and no one knows who the Son is
 but the Father
 and who the Father is
 but the Son and he to whom the Son will reveal him.","And he turned him unto his disciples and said privately
 Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see
","for I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see those things which ye see and did not see them and to hear those things which ye hear and did not hear them.","And
 behold
 a certain lawyer stood up and tempted him
 saying
 Master
 what shall I do to inherit eternal life?","He said unto him
 What is written in the law? How readest thou?","And he said unto him
 Thou hast answered right; do this
 and thou shalt live.","And Jesus answering said
 A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among thieves
 which stripped him of his raiment and wounded him and departed
 leaving him half dead.","And it so happened that a certain priest came down that way; and when he saw him
 he passed by on the other side.","And likewise a Levite
 when he came near the place and looked on him
 he passed by on the other side.","But a certain Samaritan
 as he journeyed
 came where he was; and when he saw him
 he was moved with compassion","and went to him and bound up his wounds
 pouring in oil and wine
 and set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn and took care of him.","And on the morrow when he departed
 he took out two denarius and gave them to the host and said unto him
 Take care of him; and whatever thou spendest more
 when I come again
 I will repay thee.","Which now of these three
 thinkest thou
 was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves?","And he said
 He that showed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him
 Go and do thou likewise.","And Jesus answered and said unto her
 Martha
 Martha
 thou art careful and troubled about many things;","but only one thing is necessary
 and Mary has chosen that good part
 which shall not be taken away from her.","And it came to pass that as he was praying in a certain place
 when he ceased
 one of his disciples said unto him
 Lord
 teach us to pray as John also taught his disciples.","And he said unto them
 When ye pray
 say
 Our Father who art in the heavens
 Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done
 as in heaven
 so also in the earth.","Give us day by day our daily bread.","And forgive us our sins
 for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation
 but deliver us from evil.","And he said unto them
 Which of you shall have a friend and shall go unto him at midnight and say unto him
 Friend
 lend me three loaves;","for a friend of mine in his journey is come to me
 and I have nothing to set before him?","And he from within shall answer and say
 Trouble me not; the door is now shut
 and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee.","I say unto you
 Though he will not rise and give him because he is his friend
 yet because of his importunity
 he will rise and give him as many as he needs.","And I say unto you
 Ask
 and it shall be given you; seek
 and ye shall find; knock
 and it shall be opened unto you.","For every one that asks receives; and he that seeks finds; and to him that knocks it shall be opened.","If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father
 will he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish
 will he for a fish give him a serpent?","Or if he shall ask an egg
 will he offer him a scorpion?","If ye then
 being evil
 know how to give good gifts unto your children
 how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those that ask him?","And he was casting out a demon
 and it was dumb. And it came to pass
 when the demon was gone out
 the one who had been dumb spoke; and the people marvelled.","But he
 knowing their thoughts
 said unto them
 Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every house or city divided against itself will not remain.","If Satan also is divided against himself
 how shall his kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out demons through Beelzebub.","And if I by Beelzebub cast out demons
 by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges.","But if I with the finger of God cast out the demons
 certainly the kingdom of God is come upon you.","When an armed strong man keeps his palace
 his goods are in peace;","but when another stronger than he shall come upon him and overcome him
 he takes from him all his arms in which he trusted and divides his spoils.","He that is not with me is against me
 and he that does not gather with me scatters.","When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man
 he walks through dry places
 seeking rest; and finding none
 he says
 I will return unto my house from which I came out.","And when he comes
 he finds it swept and garnished.","Then he goes
 and takes unto him seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and they enter in and dwell there
 and the last state of that man is worse than the first.","And it came to pass as he spoke these things
 a certain woman of the crowd lifted up her voice and said unto him
 Blessed is the womb that bare thee and the breasts which thou hast sucked.","But he said
 Rather
 blessed are those that hear the word of God and keep it.","And gathering the people unto him
 he began to say
 This is an evil generation: they seek a sign
 and no sign shall be given it but the sign of Jonah the prophet.","For as Jonah was a sign unto the Ninevites
 so shall also the Son of man be to this generation.","The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment against the men of this generation and condemn them
 for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and
 behold
 a greater than Solomon is here.","The men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this generation
 and shall condemn it
 for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and
 behold
 a greater than Jonah is here.","No one
 when he has lighted a lamp
 puts it in a secret place
 neither under a bushel
 but on a lampstand that those who come in may see the light.","The lamp of the body is the eye; therefore when thine eye is sincere
 thy whole body also is full of light; but when thine eye is evil
 thy body also is full of darkness.","Take heed therefore if the light which is in thee is darkness.","If thy whole body therefore is full of light
 having no part dark
 the whole shall be full of light as when the bright shining of a lamp doth give thee light.","And the Lord said unto him
 Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness.","Ye fools
 did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also?","But rather give alms {lit. do acts of mercy} of such things as ye have; and
 behold
 all things are clean unto you.","But woe unto you
 Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs and pass over the judgment and the charity of God; these ought ye to have done
 and not to leave the other undone.","Woe unto you
 Pharisees! for ye love the first seats in the synagogues and greetings in the markets.","Woe unto you
 scribes and Pharisees
 hypocrites! for ye are as graves which are not seen
 and the men that walk over them are not aware of them.","And he said
 Woe unto you also
 ye lawyers! for ye burden men with burdens grievous to be borne
 and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers.","Woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets
 and your fathers killed them.","Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers: for they indeed killed them
 and ye build their sepulchres.","Therefore also said the wisdom of God
 I will send them prophets and apostles
 and some of them they shall slay and others they shall persecute:","that the blood of all the prophets which was shed from the foundation of the world may be required of this generation
","from the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias
 who perished between the altar and the temple; verily I say unto you
 It shall be required of this generation.","Woe unto you
 lawyers! for ye have taken the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves
 and those that were entering in
 ye hindered.","In the meantime
 when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people
 insomuch that they trode one upon another
 he began to say unto his disciples first of all
 Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees
 which is hypocrisy.","For there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed
 neither hid that shall not be known.","Therefore whatever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light
 and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.","And I say unto you my friends
 Be not afraid of those that kill the body and
 after that
 have no more that they can do.","But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him
 who
 after being killed
 has power to cast into hell; yea
 I say unto you
 Fear him.","Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings
 and not one of them is forgotten before God?","But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not
 therefore; ye are of more value than many sparrows.","Also I say unto you
 Whosoever shall confess me before men
 him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God;","but he that denies me before men shall be denied before the angels of God.","And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man
 there is forgiveness for him; but unto him that blasphemes against the Holy Spirit
 it shall not be forgiven.","And when they bring you unto the synagogues and unto magistrates and powers
 take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer or what ye shall say;","for the Holy Spirit shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say.","And he said unto him
 Man
 who made me a judge or a divider over you?","And he said unto them
 Take heed and beware of all covetousness; for a man\u2019s life consists not in the abundance of the things which he possesses.","And he spoke a parable unto them
 saying
 The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully;","and he thought within himself
 saying
 What shall I do because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?","And he said
 This will I do: I will pull down my storehouses and build greater
 and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods.","And I will say to my soul
 Soul
 thou hast many goods laid up for many years; take thine ease
 eat
 drink
 and be merry.","But God said unto him
 Thou fool
 this night thy soul shall be required of thee; then whose shall those things be which thou hast stored up?","So is he that lays up treasure for himself and is not rich in God.","And he said unto his disciples
 Therefore I say unto you
 Take no thought for your life
 what ye shall eat; neither for the body
 what ye shall put on.","The life is more than food
 and the body is more than raiment.","Consider the ravens
 for they neither sow nor reap
 which neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feeds them: how much more are ye better than the fowls?","And which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit?","If ye then are not able to do that thing which is least
 why take ye thought for the rest?","Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not
 they spin not; and yet I say unto you that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.","If then God so clothes the grass
 which is today in the field and tomorrow is cast into the oven
 how much more will he clothe you
 O ye of little faith?","And seek not what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink
 neither be ye high minded.","For all these things do the Gentiles of the world seek after
 and your Father knows that ye have need of these things.","But rather seek ye the kingdom of God
 and all these things shall be added unto you.","Fear not
 little flock
 for it is your Father\u2019s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.","Sell what ye have and give alms; {lit. do acts of mercy} provide yourselves bags which wax not old
 a treasure in the heavens that fails not
 where no thief approaches neither moth corrupts.","For where your treasure is
 there will your heart be also.","Let your loins be girded about and your lamps burning
","and ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord
 when he will return from the wedding; that when he comes and knocks
 they may open unto him immediately.","Blessed are those slaves
 whom the lord when he comes shall find watching; verily I say unto you that he shall gird himself and make them to sit down to food and will come forth and serve them.","And if he shall come in the second watch or come in the third watch and find them so
 blessed are those slaves.","And know this: that if the husband of the house had known what hour the thief would come
 he would have watched and not have suffered his house to be broken through.","Be ye therefore ready also; for the Son of man comes at an hour when ye think not.","And the Lord said
 Who then is that faithful and wise steward whom his lord shall make ruler over his household to give them their portion of food in due season?","Blessed is that slave whom his lord when he comes shall find so doing.","Of a truth I say unto you that he will make him ruler over all that he has.","But and if that slave shall say in his heart
 My lord delays his coming
 and shall begin to beat the menslaves and maids and to eat and drink and to be drunken
","the lord of that slave will come in a day when he does not look for him and at an hour when he is not aware and will cut him off and will appoint him his portion with the unfaithful.","And that slave who knew his lord\u2019s will and prepared not himself
 neither did according to his will
 shall be beaten with many stripes.","But he that knew not and did commit things worthy of stripes shall be beaten with few stripes. For unto whomsoever much is given
 of him shall much be required; and to whom much was committed
 more will be asked of him.","I am come to cast fire into the earth; and what do I desire
 except that it be kindled?","But I have a baptism to be baptized with
 and how I am anguished until it is accomplished!","Think ye that I am come to the earth to give peace? No
 I tell you
 but rather division;","for from now on there shall be five in one house divided: three against two and two against three.","The father shall be divided against the son and the son against the father
 the mother against the daughter and the daughter against the mother
 the mother-in-law against her daughter- in-law and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.","And he said also to the people
 When ye see the cloud rising out of the west
 straightway ye say
 A shower comes
 and so it is.","And when the south wind blows
 ye say
 There will be heat
 and it comes to pass.","Ye hypocrites
 ye can discern the face of the sky and of the earth; but how is it that ye do not discern this time?","Yea
 and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right?","When thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate
 as thou art in the way
 give diligence that thou may be delivered from him
 lest he drag thee away to the judge
 and the judge deliver thee to the officer
 and the officer cast thee into prison.","I tell thee
 in no wise shalt thou come out of there until thou hast paid the very last mite.","And Jesus
 answering
 said unto them
 Think ye that these Galilaeans suffered such things because they were greater sinners than all the other Galilaeans?","I tell you
 No; but
 except ye repent
 ye shall all likewise perish.","Or those eighteen upon whom the tower in Siloam fell and slew them
 think ye that they were greater debtors than all the other men that dwelt in Jerusalem?","I tell you
 No; but
 except ye repent
 ye shall all likewise perish.","And He spoke this parable: A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard
 and he came and sought fruit upon it and found none.","Then he said unto the dresser of his vineyard
 Behold
 these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none; cut it down; why does it cumber the ground?","And he
 answering
 said unto him
 Lord
 let it alone this year also until I shall dig about it and dung it
","and if it bears fruit
 well; and if not
 then after that thou shalt cut it down.","And when Jesus saw her
 he called her and said unto her
 Woman
 thou art loosed from thine infirmity.","The Lord then answered him and said
 Thou hypocrite
 does not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall and lead it away to drink?","And regarding this daughter of Abraham
 who
 behold
 Satan had bound eighteen years
 does it not behoove us to release her from this bond on the Sabbath day?","Then said he
 Unto what is the kingdom of God like? and unto what shall I compare it?","It is like a grain of mustard seed
 which a man took and cast into his garden; and it grew and waxed a great tree; and the fowls of the heaven lodged in the branches of it.","And again he said
 Unto what shall I compare the kingdom of God?","It is like leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened.","Then someone said unto him
 Lord
 are there few that are saved? And he said unto them
","Strive to enter in at the narrow gate; for many
 I say unto you
 will seek to enter in and shall not be able.","When once the husband of the house is risen up and shall have shut the door
 and ye begin to stand without and to knock at the door
 saying
 Lord
 Lord
 open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto you
 I know you not from where ye are
","then shall ye begin to say
 We have eaten and drunk in thy presence
 and thou hast taught in our streets.","But he shall say unto you
 I know you not from where ye are; depart from me
 all ye workers of iniquity.","In that place shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth when ye shall see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God
 and you yourselves thrust out.","And others shall come from the east and from the west and from the north and from the south and shall sit at the table in the kingdom of God.","And
 behold
 there are last which shall be first
 and there are first which shall be last.","And he said unto them
 Go ye and tell that fox
 Behold
 I cast out demons
 and I do cures today and tomorrow
 and the third day I shall be perfected.","Nevertheless I must walk today and tomorrow and the day following
 for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem.","O Jerusalem
 Jerusalem
 which kills the prophets and stones those that are sent unto thee
 how often would I have gathered thy children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings
 and ye would not!","Behold
 your house is left unto you desolate; and verily I say unto you
 Ye shall not see me until the time comes when ye shall say
 Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord.","And Jesus
 answering
 spoke unto the lawyers and Pharisees
 saying
 Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day?","and answered them
 saying
 Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day?","When thou art called to a wedding by anyone
 do not sit down in the highest place
 lest a more honourable man than thou be invited of him
","and he that called thee and him come and say to thee
 Give this man place
 and thou begin with shame to have the lowest place.","But when thou art called
 go and sit down in the lowest place that when he that invited thee comes
 he may say unto thee
 Friend
 come up higher; then shalt thou have glory in the presence of those that sit at the table with thee.","For whosoever exalts himself shall be abased
 and he that humbles himself shall be exalted.","Then said he also to him that invited him
 When thou makest a dinner or a supper
 call not thy friends nor thy brethren
 neither thy kinsmen nor thy rich neighbours
 lest they also invite thee again
 and a recompense be made thee.","But when thou makest a banquet
 call the poor
 the maimed
 the lame
 the blind
","and thou shalt be blessed
 for they cannot recompense thee; for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.","And when one of those that sat at the table with him heard these things
 he said unto him
 Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.","Then said he unto him
 A certain man made a great supper and called many","and sent his slave at supper time to say to those that were called
 Come
 for all things are now ready.","And they all with one consent began to make excuse. The first said unto him
 I have bought a field
 and I have need to go and see it; I pray thee have me excused.","And another said
 I have bought five yoke of oxen
 and I go to prove them; I pray thee have me excused.","And another said
 I have married a wife
 and therefore I cannot come.","So that slave came and showed his lord these things. Then the husband of the house
 being angry
 said to his slave
 Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city and bring in here the poor and the maimed and the halt and the blind.","And the slave said
 Lord
 it is done as thou hast commanded
 and yet there is room.","And the lord said unto the slave
 Go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in that my house may be filled.","For I say unto you
 That none of those men which were called shall taste of my supper.","And great multitudes went with him
 and he turned and said unto them
","If anyone comes to me and does not hate his father and mother and wife and children and brethren and sisters
 and even his own life also
 he cannot be my disciple.","And whosoever does not bear his cross {Gr. stauros \u2013 stake} and come after me cannot be my disciple.","For which of you intending to build a tower does not sit down first and count the cost
 whether he has sufficient to finish it?","Lest perhaps after he has laid the foundation and is not able to finish it
 all that behold it begin to mock him
","saying
 This man began to build
 and was not able to finish.","Or what king going to make war against another king does not sit down first and consult whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him that comes against him with twenty thousand?","Or else
 while the other is yet a great way off
 he sends an embassy and desires conditions of peace.","So likewise
 any one of you that does not forsake all that he has cannot be my disciple.","Salt is good; but if the salt has lost its savour
 with what shall it be seasoned?","It is neither good for the land
 nor for the dunghill; it is cast out. He that has ears to hear
 let him hear.","What man of you having a hundred sheep if he lose one of them
 does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go after that which is lost until he finds it?","And when he has found it
 he lays it on his shoulders
 rejoicing.","And when he comes home
 he calls together his friends and neighbours
 saying unto them
 Rejoice with me
 for I have found my sheep which was lost.","I say unto you that likewise there shall be more joy in heaven over one sinner that repents than over ninety-nine just persons
 who need no repentance.","Or what woman having ten drachmas
 if she loses one drachma
 does not light a lamp and sweep the house and seek diligently until she finds it?","And when she has found it
 she calls her friends and her neighbours together
 saying
 Rejoice with me
 for I have found the drachma which I had lost.","Likewise
 I say unto you
 there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repents.","And he said
 A certain man had two sons;","and the younger of them said to his father
 Father
 give me the portion of the estate that falls to me. And he divided unto them his living.","And not many days after
 the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country and there wasted his estate with riotous living.","And when he had spent all
 there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want.","And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.","And he longed to fill his belly with the husks that the swine ate
 but no one gave them unto him.","And when he came to himself
 he said
 How many hired servants of my father\u2019s have abundance of bread
 and I perish here with hunger!","I will arise and go to my father and will say unto him
 Father
 I have sinned against heaven and before thee","and am no longer worthy to be called thy son; make me as one of thy hired servants.","And he arose and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off
 his father saw him and was moved with compassion and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him.","And the son said unto him
 Father
 I have sinned against heaven and in thy sight and am no longer worthy to be called thy son.","But the father said to his slaves
 Bring forth the best robe and put it on him and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet","and bring here the fatted calf and kill it
 and let us eat and be merry;","for this my son was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found. And they began to be merry.","Now his elder son was in the field
 and as he came and drew near to the house
 he heard music and dancing.","And he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant.","And he said unto him
 Thy brother is come
 and thy father has killed the fatted calf because he has received him safe and sound.","And he was angry and would not go in
 therefore his father came out and intreated him.","And he
 answering
 said to his father
 Behold
 these many years I have served thee
 neither at any time have I transgressed thy commandment; and yet thou never gavest me a kid that I might make merry with my friends.","But as soon as this thy son was come who has devoured thy living with harlots
 thou hast killed the fatted calf for him.","And he said unto him
 Son
 thou art always with me
 and all that I have is thine.","It was necessary that we should make merry and be glad
 for this thy brother was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.","And he said also unto his disciples
 There was a certain rich man who had a steward
 and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods.","And he called him and said unto him
 How is it that I hear this of thee? Give an account of thy stewardship
 for thou may no longer be steward.","Then the steward said within himself
 What shall I do? for my lord takes the stewardship away from me; I cannot dig
 and I am ashamed to beg.","I know what I shall do
 that
 when I am put out of the stewardship
 they may receive me into their houses.","So he called each one of his lord\u2019s debtors unto him and said unto the first
 How much dost thou owe unto my lord?","And he said
 A hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him
 Take thy bill and sit down quickly and write fifty.","Then said he to another
 And how much dost thou owe? And he said
 A hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him
 Take thy bill and write eighty.","And the lord commended the unjust steward because he had done discreetly; for the sons of this age are in their generation more prudent than the sons of light.","And I say unto you
 Make friends unto yourselves with the mammon of unrighteousness; that
 when these fail
 you may be received into eternal dwellings.","He that is faithful with little is faithful also with much
 and he that is unjust with little is unjust also with much.","If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon
 who will commit to your trust the true?","And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man\u2019s
 who shall give you that which is your own?","No servant can serve two masters
 for either he will hate the one and love the other
 or else he will hold to the one and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.","And he said unto them
 Ye are they who justify themselves before men
 but God knows your hearts
 for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.","The law and the prophets were until John; since that time the kingdom of God is preached
 and whosoever will presses into it.","And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass than one tittle of the law to fail.","Whosoever puts away his wife and marries another commits adultery
 and whosoever marries her that is put away of her husband commits adultery.","There was a certain rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and fared sumptuously every day;","and there was a certain beggar named Lazarus
 who was laid at his gate
 full of sores","and desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man\u2019s table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.","And it came to pass that the beggar died and was carried by the angels into Abraham\u2019s bosom; the rich man also died and was buried;","and in Hades he lifted up his eyes
 being in torments
 and saw Abraham afar off and Lazarus in his bosom.","And he cried and said
 Father Abraham
 have mercy on me and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.","But Abraham said
 Son
 remember that thou in thy lifetime didst receive thy good things
 and likewise Lazarus evil things; but now he is comforted here
 and thou art tormented.","And beside all this
 between us and you there is a great gulf fixed
 so that those who would pass from here to you cannot; neither can they pass from there to us.","Then he said
 I pray thee therefore
 father
 that thou would send him to my father\u2019s house
","for I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them
 lest they also come into this place of torment.","Abraham said unto him
 They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.","And he said
 No
 father Abraham; but if one went unto them from the dead
 they will repent.","And he said unto him
 If they do not hear Moses and the prophets
 neither will they be persuaded
 even though one rose from the dead.","Then he said unto the disciples
 It is impossible that offenses will not come
 but woe unto the one through whom they come!","It would be better for him if a millstone turned by an ass were placed around his neck and he were cast into the sea than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble.","Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother should trespass against thee
 rebuke him; and if he repents
 forgive him.","And if he trespasses against thee seven times in a day and seven times in a day turns again to thee
 saying
 I repent
 thou shalt forgive him.","And the Lord said
 If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed
 ye might say unto this sycamore tree
 Pluck thyself up by the root
 and plant thyself in the sea
 and it would obey you.","But which of you
 having a slave plowing or feeding cattle
 will say unto him by and by when he is come from the field
 Go and sit down at the table?","And will not rather say unto him
 Make ready wherewith I may sup and gird thyself and serve me until I have eaten and drunken
 and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?","Does he thank that slave because he did the things that were commanded him? I think not.","So likewise ye
 when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you
 say
 We are unprofitable slaves: we have done that which was our duty to do.","And it came to pass as he went to Jerusalem that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.","When he saw them
 he said unto them
 Go show yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass that as they went
 they were cleansed.","And Jesus answering said
 Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine?","Were there not found any returning to give glory to God
 except this stranger?","And he said unto him
 Arise
 go; thy faith has saved thee.","And when he was asked of the Pharisees when the kingdom of God should come
 he answered them and said
 The kingdom of God does not come with observation;","neither shall they say
 Behold it here! or
 Behold it there! for
 behold
 the kingdom of God is within you.","And he said unto the disciples
 The days will come when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man
 and ye shall not see it.","And they shall say to you
 Behold it here
 or
 Behold it there; do not go
 nor follow them.","For as the lightning
 which shines from the region under heaven
 shines in that which is under heaven; so also shall the Son of man be in his day.","But first he must suffer many things and be rejected of this generation.","And as it was in the days of Noah
 so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.","They ate
 they drank
 they married wives
 they were given in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark
 and the flood came and destroyed them all.","Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they ate
 they drank
 they bought
 they sold
 they planted
 they built;","but the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all.","Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.","In that day
 he who shall be upon the housetop and his stuff in the house
 let him not come down to take it away; and he that is in the field
 let him likewise not turn back.","Remember Lot\u2019s wife.","Whosoever shall seek to save his soul shall lose it
 and whosoever shall lose it shall cause it to live.","I tell you in that night there shall be two men in one bed: the one shall be taken
 and the other shall be left.","Two women shall be grinding together: the one shall be taken
 and the other left.","And they answered and said unto him
 Where
 Lord? And he said unto them
 Where the body is
 there will the eagles be gathered together.","saying
 There was in a city a judge who did not fear God nor regard man;","and there was a widow in that city
 and she came unto him
 saying
 Defend me from my adversary.","And he would not for a while
 but afterward he said within himself
 Though I do not fear God
 nor regard man
","yet because this widow troubles me
 I will do her justice
 lest by her continual coming she weary me.","And the Lord said
 Hear what the unjust judge says.","And shall not God avenge his own elect who cry day and night unto him though he bears long regarding them?","I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man comes
 shall he find faith on the earth?","Two men went up into the temple to pray
 the one a Pharisee
 and the other a publican.","The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself
 God
 I thank thee that I am not as other men are: extortioners
 unjust
 adulterers
 or even as this publican.","I fast two meals every sabbath; I give tithes of all that I possess.","And the publican
 standing afar off
 would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven
 but smote upon his breast
 saying
 God
 reconcile me
 a sinner.","I tell you
 this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for anyone that exalts himself shall be humbled
 and he that humbles himself shall be exalted.","But Jesus called them unto him and said
 Suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not
 for of such is the kingdom of God.","Verily I say unto you
 Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.","And Jesus said unto him
 Why dost thou call me good? No one is good except one
 that is
 God.","Thou knowest the commandments
 Thou shalt not commit adultery
 Thou shalt not murder
 Thou shalt not steal
 Thou shalt not bear false witness
 Honour thy father and thy mother.","And he said
 All these things I have kept from my youth up.","Now when Jesus heard this
 he said unto him
 Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast and distribute unto the poor
 and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come
 follow me.","And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful
 he said
 How difficult it is for those that have riches to enter into the kingdom of God!","For it is easier to put a cable through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.","And he said
 The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.","And he said unto them
 Verily I say unto you
 There is no one that has left house or parents or brethren or wife or children for the kingdom of God\u2019s sake","who shall not receive manifold more in this present time and in the age to come
 eternal life.","Then he took unto him the twelve and said unto them
 Behold
 we go up to Jerusalem
 and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.","For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles and shall be mocked and spitefully treated and spitted on;","and they shall scourge him and put him to death
 but the third day he shall rise again.","And they understood none of these things
 and this word was hid from them
 and they did not know what was said.","saying
 What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And he said
 Lord
 that I may see.","And Jesus said unto him
 See; thy faith has saved thee.","And when Jesus came to the place
 he looked up and saw him and said unto him
 Zacchaeus
 make haste and come down; for today I must abide at thy house.","Then Zacchaeus stood and said unto the Lord; Behold
 Lord
 the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation
 I restore him fourfold.","And Jesus said unto him
 This day saving health is come to this house
 inasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham.","For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.","He said therefore
 A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom
 and to return.","And having called ten of his slaves
 he delivered them ten minas and said unto them
 Trade until I come.","But his citizens hated him and sent an embassy after him
 saying
 We will not have this man to reign over us.","And it came to pass that when he was returned
 having received the kingdom
 then he commanded these slaves to be called unto him
 to whom he had given the money
 that he might know how much each one had gained by trading.","Then came the first
 saying
 Lord
 thy mina has gained ten minas.","And he said unto him
 Well done
 thou good slave; because thou hast been faithful in a very little
 thou shalt have authority over ten cities.","And the second came
 saying
 Lord
 thy mina has made five minas.","And he said likewise to him
 Be thou also over five cities.","And another came
 saying
 Lord
 behold
 here is thy mina
 which I have kept laid up in a napkin
","for I feared thee because thou art an austere man: thou takest up that which thou didst not lay down and dost reap that which thou didst not sow.","Then he said unto him
 Out of thine own mouth I will judge thee
 thou wicked slave. Thou knewest that I was an austere man
 taking up that which I did not lay down
 and reaping that which I did not sow;","why then didst thou not give my money into the bank
 that at my coming I might have required my own with interest?","And he said unto those that stood by
 Take from him the mina and give it to him that has the ten minas.","(And they said unto him
 Lord
 he has ten minas.)","For I say unto you
 That unto every one who has shall be given; and from him that has not
 even that which he has shall be taken away from him.","Moreover
 those enemies of mine
 who were unwilling that I should reign over them
 bring them here and slay them before me.","saying
 Go ye into the village over against you
 in which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied
 upon whom no one has ever sat; loose him
 and bring him here.","And if anyone asks you
 Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say unto him
 Because the Lord has need of him.","And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him
 Master
 rebuke thy disciples.","And he answered and said unto them
 I tell you that if these should be silent
 the stones would immediately cry out.","saying
 If thou hadst known
 even thou
 at least in this thy day
 the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.","For the days shall come upon thee that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee and compass thee round and constrain thee on every side","and shall cast thee down to the ground and thy children within thee
 and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.","saying unto them
 It is written
 My house is a house of prayer
 but ye have made it a den of thieves.","And he answered and said unto them
 I will also ask you one thing
 and answer me:","The baptism of John
 was it from heaven or of men?","Then Jesus said unto them
 Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.","And he began to speak this parable to the people: A certain man planted a vineyard and let it out to husbandmen and went into a far country for a long time.","And at the season he sent a slave to the husbandmen that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard
 but the husbandmen beat him and sent him away empty.","And again he sent another slave
 and they beat him also and treated him shamefully and sent him away empty.","And again he sent a third
 and they wounded him also and cast him out.","Then said the lord of the vineyard
 What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; it may be they will reverence him when they see him.","But when the husbandmen saw him
 they reasoned among themselves
 saying
 This is the heir; come
 let us kill him that the inheritance may be ours.","So they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him. What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them?","He shall come and destroy these husbandmen and shall give the vineyard to others. And when they heard it
 they said
 May it not be!","But he beheld them and said
 What is this then that is written
 The stone which the builders rejected
 the same is become the head of the corner?","Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken
 but on whomsoever it shall fall
 it will grind him to powder.","And they watched him and sent forth spies who feigned themselves just men that they might take hold of him as he was speaking
 that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor.","Show me a denarius. Whose image and inscription does it have? They answered and said
 Caesar\u2019s.","And he said unto them
 Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar\u2019s and unto God the things which are God\u2019s.","And they could not take hold of his words before the people
 and they marvelled at his answer and were silent.","And Jesus answering said unto them
 The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage
","but those who are accounted worthy to obtain that age and the resurrection from the dead neither marry
 nor are given in marriage;","for neither can they die any more
 for they are equal unto the angels and are the sons of God
 being the sons of the resurrection.","Now that the dead are raised
 even Moses showed this at the bush when he calls the Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.","For he is not a God of the dead
 but of the living; for all live unto him.","And he said unto them
 How do they say that the Christ is David\u2019s son?","And David himself says in the book of Psalms
 The LORD said unto my Lord
 Sit thou on my right hand","until I make thine enemies thy footstool.","David therefore calls him Lord; how is he then his son?","Beware of the scribes
 who desire to walk in long robes and love greetings in the markets and the first seats in the synagogues and the first places at suppers;","who devour the houses of the widows and for a pretext make long prayers: the same shall receive greater damnation.","And he said
 Of a truth I say unto you that this poor widow has cast in more than they all;","for all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of God
 but she out of her poverty has cast in all the living that she had.","As for these things which ye behold
 the days will come in which there shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down.","Then he said
 Take heed that ye not be deceived
 for many shall come in my name
 saying
 I am; and the time draws near; therefore
 go ye not after them.","But when ye shall hear of wars and seditions
 be not terrified; for these things must first come to pass
 but the end is not yet.","Then he said unto them
 Gentiles shall rise against Gentiles
 and kingdom against kingdom;","and there shall be great earthquakes in different places and famines and pestilences
 and there shall be fearful sights and great signs from heaven.","But before all these
 they shall lay their hands on you and persecute you
 delivering you up to the synagogues and into prisons
 being brought before kings and governors for my name\u2019s sake.","And it shall turn out to you for a testimony.","Settle it therefore in your hearts not to meditate before what ye shall answer;","for I will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist.","And ye shall be betrayed both by parents and brethren and kinsfolk and friends
 and some of you they shall cause to be put to death.","And ye shall be hated of all men for my name\u2019s sake.","But not a hair of your head shall perish.","In your patience ye shall possess your souls.","And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies
 then know that the desolation thereof is near.","Then let those who are in Judaea flee to the mountains
 and let those who are in the midst of it depart out
 and let not those that are in the country enter thereinto.","For these are days of vengeance
 that all things which are written may be fulfilled.","But woe unto those that are with child and to those that give suck in those days! For there shall be great distress in the land and wrath upon this people.","And they shall fall by the edge of the sword and shall be led away captive into all nations
 and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.","Then there shall be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars
 and upon the earth distress of nations
 with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;","men\u2019s hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth; for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.","And then they shall see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.","And when these things begin to come to pass
 then look up and lift up your heads
 for your redemption draws near.","And he spoke unto them a parable: Behold the fig tree and all the trees;","when they now shoot forth
 ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now near at hand.","So likewise ye
 when ye see these things come to pass
 know ye that the kingdom of God is near at hand.","Verily I say unto you
 This generation shall not pass away until all is fulfilled.","The heaven and the earth shall pass away
 but my words shall not pass away.","And take heed to yourselves
 lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with excess and drunkenness and cares of this life
 and so that day come upon you unawares.","For as a snare it shall come on all those that dwell on the face of the whole earth.","Watch ye therefore and pray always that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and to stand before the Son of man.","And he sent Peter and John
 saying
 Go and prepare us the passover lamb that we may eat.","And he said unto them
 Behold
 when ye are entered into the city
 there ye shall find a man bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he enters in.","And ye shall say unto the husband of the house
 The Master saith unto thee
 Where is the guestchamber where I shall eat the passover lamb with my disciples?","And he shall show you a large upper room furnished; there make ready.","And he said unto them
 With desire I have greatly desired to eat this passover lamb with you before I suffer;","for I say unto you
 I will not eat any more thereof until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.","And taking the cup
 having given thanks
 he said
 Take this
 and divide it among yourselves
","for I say unto you
 I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God shall come.","And taking bread
 having given thanks
 he broke it and gave unto them
 saying
 This is my body which is given for you; do this in remembrance of me.","Likewise also he took and gave them the cup after supper
 saying
 This cup is the new testament in my blood
 which is shed for you.","But with all this
 behold
 the hand of him that betrays me is with me on the table.","And truly the Son of man goes as it was determined; but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed!","Then he said unto them
 The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them
 and those that exercise authority upon them are called well-doers.","But ye shall not be so
 but he that is greatest among you
 let him be as the younger; and he that is prince
 as he that doth serve.","For who is greater
 he that sits at the table or he that serves? Is it not he that sits at the table? But I am among you as he that serves.","But ye are those who have continued with me in my temptations.","And I appoint unto you a kingdom as my Father has appointed unto me;","that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.","And the Lord said
 Simon
 Simon
 behold
 Satan has desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat;","but I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not; and when thou art converted
 strengthen thy brethren.","And he said unto him
 Lord
 I am ready to go with thee
 both into prison and to death.","And he said
 I tell thee
 Peter
 thou shalt deny three times that thou knowest me before the cock shall crow this day.","And he said unto them
 When I sent you without purse and provision bag and shoes
 lacked ye anything? And they said
 Nothing.","Then he said unto them
 But now
 he that has a purse
 let him take it and likewise his provision bag; and he that has no sword
 let him sell his garment and buy one.","For I say unto you that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me
 And he was reckoned among the transgressors; for the things written concerning me have a fulfillment.","Then they said
 Lord
 behold
 here are two swords. And he said unto them
 It is enough.","And when he was at the place
 he said unto them
 Pray that ye enter not into temptation.","saying
 Father
 if thou be willing
 remove this cup from me; nevertheless not my will
 but thine
 be done.","and said unto them
 Why sleep ye? rise and pray
 lest ye enter into temptation.","But Jesus said unto him
 Judas
 betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?","And Jesus answered and said
 Suffer ye thus far. And he touched his ear and healed him.","Then Jesus said unto the princes of the priests and captains of the temple and the elders
 who were come to him
 Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves?","When I was daily with you in the temple
 ye stretched forth no hands against me; but this is your hour
 and the power of darkness.","Then the Lord turned and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord how he had said unto him
 Before the cock crows
 thou shalt deny me three times.","Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them
 If I tell you
 ye will not believe;","and if I also ask you
 ye will not answer me nor let me go;","but from now on the Son of man shall sit on the right hand of the power of God.","Then they all said
 Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them
 Ye say that I AM.","Then Pilate asked him
 saying
 Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said
 Thou sayest it.","When Pilate heard of Galilee
 he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.","said unto them
 Ye have brought this man unto me as one that perverts the people; and
 behold
 I
 having examined him before you
 have found no fault in this man touching those things of which ye accuse him;","And he said unto them the third time
 Why
 what evil has he done? I have found no cause of death in him; I will therefore chastise him and let him go.","But Jesus turning unto them said
 Daughters of Jerusalem
 weep not for me
 but weep for yourselves and for your children.","For
 behold
 the days are coming
 in which they shall say
 Blessed are the barren and the wombs that never bare and the breasts which never gave suck.","Then shall they begin to say to the mountains
 Fall on us; and to the hills
 Cover us.","For if they do these things in the green tree
 what shall be done in the dry?","Then Jesus said
 Father
 forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment and cast lots.","And Jesus said unto him
 Verily I say unto thee
 Today shalt thou be with me in paradise.","Then Jesus cried out with a loud voice and said
 Father
 into thy hands I commend my spirit; and having said thus
 he gave up the spirit.","and as they were afraid and bowed down their faces to the earth
 they said unto them
 Why seek ye the living among the dead?","And he said unto them
 What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another as ye walk and are sad?","Then he said unto them
 What things? And they said unto him
 Concerning Jesus of Nazareth
 who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people
","Then he said unto them
 O fools
 and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken;","ought not the Christ to have suffered these things and to enter (like this) into his glory?","And as they spoke these things
 Jesus himself stood in the midst of them and said unto them
 Peace be unto you.","And he said unto them
 Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?","Behold my hands and my feet
 that it is I myself; handle me and see
 for a spirit does not have flesh and bones
 as ye see me have.","And as they were not believing him yet for joy and wondering
 he said unto them
 Have ye here any food?","And he said unto them
 These are the words which I spoke unto you
 while I was yet with you
 that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses and in the prophets and in the psalms
 concerning me.","and said unto them
 Thus it is written
 and thus it behooved the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day;","and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations
 beginning from Jerusalem.","And ye are witnesses of these things.","And
 behold
 I shall send the promise of my Father upon you
 but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem until ye are endued with power from on high.","And He said unto them
 \u201cHow is it that ye sought Me? Knew ye not that I must be about My Father\u2019s business?\u201d","And Jesus answered him
 saying
 \u201cIt is written: \u2018Man shall not live by bread alone
 but by every word of God.\u2019\u201d","And the devil said unto Him
 \u201cAll this power will I give Thee
 and the glory of them; for this has been delivered unto me
 and to whomsoever I will
 I give it.","And Jesus answered and said unto him
 \u201cGet thee behind Me
 Satan! For it is written: \u2018Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God
 and Him only shalt thou serve.\u2019\u201d","And he brought Him to Jerusalem
 and set Him on a pinnacle of the temple and said unto Him
 \u201cIf Thou be the Son of God
 cast Thyself down from hence.","And Jesus answering said unto him
 \u201cIt is said
 \u2018Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.\u2019\u201d","\u201cThe Spirit of the Lord is upon Me
 because He hath anointed Me to preach the Gospel to the poor. He hath sent Me to heal the brokenhearted
 to preach deliverance to the captives
 and recovering of sight to the blind
 to set at liberty them that are bruised
","to preach the acceptable year of the Lord.\u201d","And He began to say unto them
 \u201cThis day is this Scripture fulfilled in your ears.\u201d","And He said unto them
 \u201cYe will surely say unto Me this proverb: \u2018Physician
 heal thyself! Whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum
 do also here in thy country.\u2019\u201d","And He said
 \u201cVerily I say unto you
 no prophet is accepted in his own country.","But I tell you in truth
 many widows were in Israel in the days of Elijah
 when the heaven was shut up three years and six months
 when great famine was throughout all the land.","But unto none of them was Elijah sent
 save unto Zarephath
 a city of Sidon
 unto a woman that was a widow.","And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet
 and none of them was cleansed
 except Naaman the Syrian.\u201d","And they were astonished at His doctrine
 for His word was with power.","And Jesus rebuked him
 saying
 \u201cHold thy peace
 and come out of him!\u201d And when the devil had thrown him in their midst
 he came out of him and hurt him not.","And devils also came out of many
 crying out and saying
 \u201cThou art Christ
 the Son of God!\u201d And He
 rebuking them
 suffered them not to speak; for they knew that He was Christ.","But He said unto them
 \u201cI must preach the Kingdom of God to other cities also
 for therefore am I sent.\u201d","Now when He was through speaking
 He said unto Simon
 \u201cLaunch out into the deep
 and let down your nets for a draft.\u201d","and so also were James and John
 the sons of Zebedee
 who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon
 \u201cFear not. From henceforth thou shalt catch men.\u201d","And He put forth His hand and touched him
 saying
 \u201cI will; be thou clean.\u201d And immediately the leprosy departed from him.","And He charged him to tell no man
 but
 \u201cGo and show thyself to the priest
 and offer for thy cleansing according as Moses commanded
 as a testimony unto them.\u201d","And when He saw their faith
 He said unto him
 \u201cMan
 thy sins are forgiven thee.\u201d","But when Jesus perceived their thoughts
 He answering said unto them
 \u201cWhat reason ye in your hearts:","whether it is easier to say
 \u2018Thy sins be forgiven thee
\u2019 or to say
 \u2018Rise up and walk\u2019?","But that ye may know that the Son of Man hath power upon earth to forgive sins
\u201d He said unto the one sick with the palsy
 \u201cI say unto thee
 arise and take up thy couch and go into thine house.\u201d","And after these things He went forth and saw a publican named Levi
 sitting in the customhouse
 and He said unto him
 \u201cFollow Me.\u201d","And Jesus answering said unto them
 \u201cThey that are whole need not a physician
 but they that are sick.","I came not to call the righteous
 but sinners to repentance.\u201d","And they said unto Him
 \u201cWhy do the disciples of John fast often and make prayers
 and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees
 but thine eat and drink?\u201d","And He said unto them
 \u201cCan ye make the attendants of the bridechamber fast while the bridegroom is with them?","But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them
 and then shall they fast in those days.\u201d","And He spoke also a parable unto them: \u201cNo man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old; otherwise
 both the new maketh a rent
 and the piece that was taken out of the new agreeth not with the old.","And no man putteth new wine into old wineskins; else the new wine will burst the wineskins and be spilled
 and the wineskins shall perish.","But new wine must be put into new wineskins
 and both are preserved.","No man also
 having drunk old wine
 straightway desireth new; for he saith
 \u2018The old is better.\u2019\u201d","And Jesus answering them said
 \u201cHave ye not read so much as this
 what David did when he himself hungered and they that were with him:","how he went into the house of God
 and took and ate the showbread and gave also to them that were with him
 which it is not lawful to eat except for the priests alone?\u201d","And He said unto them
 \u201cThe Son of Man is Lord also of the Sabbath.\u201d","But He knew their thoughts
 and said to the man who had the withered hand
 \u201cRise up and stand forth in the midst.\u201d And he arose and stood forth.","Then said Jesus unto them
 \u201cI will ask you one thing: Is it lawful on the Sabbath days to do good
 or to do evil? To save life
 or to destroy it?\u201d","And looking round about upon them all
 He said unto the man
 \u201cStretch forth thy hand.\u201d And he did so
 and his hand was restored whole as the other.","Blessed are ye that hunger now
 for ye shall be filled. Blessed are ye that weep now
 for ye shall laugh.","Blessed are ye when men shall hate you
 and when they shall separate you from their company
 and shall reproach you and cast out your name as evil
 for the Son of Man\u2019s sake.","Rejoice ye in that day and leap for joy
 for behold
 your reward is great in Heaven; for in like manner did their fathers unto the prophets.","\u201cBut woe unto you that are rich
 for ye have received your consolation.","Woe unto you that are full
 for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you that laugh now
 for ye shall mourn and weep.","Woe unto you when all men shall speak well of you
 for so did their fathers to the false prophets.","\u201cBut I say unto you that hear: Love your enemies
 do good to them that hate you.","Bless them that curse you
 and pray for them that despitefully use you.","And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek
 offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloak
 forbid not to take thy coat also.","Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods
 ask them not back.","And as ye would that men should do to you
 do ye also to them likewise.","For if ye love them that love you
 what thanks have ye? For sinners also love those that love them.","And if ye do good to them that do good to you
 what thanks have ye? For sinners also do even the same.","And if ye lend to them from whom ye hope to receive
 what thanks have ye? For sinners also lend to sinners
 to receive as much again.","But love ye your enemies
 and do good and lend
 hoping for nothing in return; and your reward shall be great
 and ye shall be the children of the Highest; for He is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil.","Be ye therefore merciful
 as your Father also is merciful.","\u201cJudge not
 and ye shall not be judged. Condemn not
 and ye shall not be condemned. Forgive
 and ye shall be forgiven.","Give
 and it shall be given unto you: good measure
 pressed down and shaken together and running over
 shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete
 therewith it shall be measured to you again.\u201d","And He spoke a parable unto them: \u201cCan the blind lead the blind? Shall they not both fall into the ditch?","The disciple is not above his master
 but every one that is perfect shall be as his master.","And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother\u2019s eye
 but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye?","Or how canst thou say to thy brother
 \u2018Brother
 let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye
\u2019 when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite! Cast out first the beam out of thine own eye
 and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother\u2019s eye.","\u201cFor a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.","For every tree is known by his own fruit. For from thorns men do not gather figs
 nor from a bramble bush gather they grapes.","A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil; for of the abundance of his heart his mouth speaketh.","\u201cAnd why call ye Me
 \u2018Lord
 Lord
\u2019 and do not the things which I say?","Whosoever cometh to Me
 and heareth My sayings and doeth them
 I will show you to whom he is like:","He is like a man who built a house and dug deep and laid the foundation on a rock; and when the flood arose
 the stream beat vehemently upon that house and could not shake it
 for it was founded upon a rock.","But he that heareth
 and doeth not
 is like a man that built a house without a foundation upon the earth
 against which the stream beat vehemently
 and immediately it fell. And the ruin of that house was great.\u201d","When Jesus heard these things
 He marveled at him
 and turned about and said unto the people who followed Him
 \u201cI say unto you
 I have not found so great a faith
 no
 not in Israel.\u201d","And when the Lord saw her
 He had compassion on her and said unto her
 \u201cWeep not.\u201d","And He came and touched the bier
 and those who bore him stood still. And He said
 \u201cYoung man
 I say unto thee
 arise.\u201d","Then Jesus answering said unto them
 \u201cGo your way
 and tell John what things ye have seen and heard: how the blind see
 the lame walk
 the lepers are cleansed
 the deaf hear
 the dead are raised
 to the poor the Gospel is preached.","And blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in Me.\u201d","And when the messengers of John had departed
 He began to speak unto the people concerning John: \u201cWhat went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?","But what went ye out to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold
 they that are gorgeously appareled and live luxuriously are in kings\u2019 courts.","But what went ye out to see? A prophet? Yea
 I say unto you
 and much more than a prophet.","This is he
 of whom it is written: \u2018Behold
 I send My messenger before Thy face
 who shall prepare Thy way before Thee.\u2019","For I say unto you
 among those that are born of women
 there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist; but he that is least in the Kingdom of God is greater than he.\u201d","And the Lord said
 \u201cWhereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? And to what are they like?","They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace
 and calling one to another and saying
 \u2018We have piped unto you
 and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you
 and ye have not wept.\u2019","For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine
 and ye say
 \u2018He hath a devil.\u2019","The Son of Man is come eating and drinking
 and ye say
 \u2018Behold
 a gluttonous man and a winebibber
 a friend of publicans and sinners!\u2019","But wisdom is justified by all her children.\u201d","Now when the Pharisee who had bidden Him saw it
 he spoke within himself
 saying
 \u201cThis man
 if he were a prophet
 would have known who and what manner of woman this is who toucheth him
 for she is a sinner.\u201d","And Jesus answering said unto him
 \u201cSimon
 I have something to say unto thee.\u201d And he said
 \u201cMaster
 say on.\u201d","\u201cThere was a certain creditor that had two debtors. The one owed five hundred pence
 and the other fifty.","And when they had nothing to pay
 he freely forgave them both. Tell me therefore
 which of them will love him most?\u201d","Simon answered and said
 \u201cI suppose that he to whom he forgave most. And He said unto him
 \u201cThou hast rightly judged.\u201d","And He turned to the woman and said unto Simon
 \u201cSeest thou this woman? I entered into thine house: Thou gavest Me no water for My feet
 but she hath washed My feet with tears and wiped them with the hair of her head.","Thou gavest Me no kiss
 but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss My feet.","My head with oil thou didst not anoint
 but this woman hath anointed My feet with ointment.","Therefore I say unto thee
 her sins
 which are many
 are forgiven
 for she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven
 the same loveth little.\u201d","And He said unto her
 \u201cThy sins are forgiven.\u201d","And He said to the woman
 \u201cThy faith hath saved thee. Go in peace.\u201d","And when many people had gathered together and had come to Him out of every city
 He spoke by a parable:","\u201cA sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed
 some fell by the wayside
 and it was trodden down
 and the fowls of the air devoured it.","And some fell upon a rock
 and as soon as it had sprung up
 it withered away because it lacked moisture.","And some fell among thorns
 and the thorns sprang up with it and choked it.","And other fell on good ground
 and sprang up and bore fruit a hundredfold.\u201d And when He had said these things
 He cried
 \u201cHe that hath ears to hear
 let him hear!\u201d","And He said
 \u201cUnto you it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of God; but to others in parables
 that \u2018seeing they might not see
 and hearing they might not understand.\u2019","Now the parable is this: The seed is the Word of God.","Those by the wayside are they that hear; then cometh the devil and taketh away the Word out of their hearts
 lest they should believe and be saved.","The seed on the rock are they that
 when they hear
 receive the Word with joy
 but they have no root: they for a while believe
 and in time of temptation fall away.","And that which fell among thorns are they that
 when they have heard
 go forth and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life
 and bring no fruit to perfection.","But that on the good ground are they that
 in an honest and good heart
 having heard the Word
 keep it and bring forth fruit with patience.","\u201cNo man
 when he hath lighted a candle
 covereth it with a vessel or putteth it under a bed
 but setteth it on a candlestick
 that they that enter in may see the light.","For nothing is secret that shall not be made manifest; neither any thing hid that shall not be known and come abroad.","Take heed therefore how ye hear
 for whosoever hath
 to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not
 from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have.\u201d","And it was told to Him by certain ones
 who said
 \u201cThy mother and thy brethren stand outside
 desiring to see thee.\u201d","And He answered and said unto them
 \u201cMy mother and My brethren are these who hear the Word of God
 and do it.\u201d","Now it came to pass on a certain day
 that He went into a boat with His disciples. And He said unto them
 \u201cLet us go over unto the other side of the lake.\u201d And they launched forth.","And He said unto them
 \u201cWhere is your faith?\u201d And they being afraid wondered
 saying one to another
 \u201cWhat manner of man is this? For He commandeth even the winds and the water
 and they obey Him!\u201d","And Jesus asked him
 saying
 \u201cWhat is thy name?\u201d And he said
 \u201cLegion
\u201d because many devils had entered into him.","\u201cReturn to thine own house
 and show what great things God hath done unto thee.\u201d And he went his way
 and proclaimed throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done unto him.","And Jesus said
 \u201cWho touched Me?\u201d When all denied it
 Peter and those who were with him said
 \u201cMaster
 the multitudes throng Thee and press Thee
 and sayest Thou
 \u2018Who touched Me?\u2019\u201d","And Jesus said
 \u201cSomebody hath touched Me
 for I perceive that virtue is gone out of Me.\u201d","And He said unto her
 \u201cDaughter
 be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole. Go in peace.\u201d","But when Jesus heard it
 He answered him
 saying
 \u201cFear not; believe only
 and she shall be made whole.\u201d","And all wept and bewailed her
 but He said
 \u201cWeep not; she is not dead
 but sleepeth.\u201d","And He put them all out
 and took her by the hand and called
 saying
 \u201cMaid
 arise.\u201d","And He said unto them
 \u201cTake nothing for your journey
 neither staves
 nor pack
 neither bread
 neither money; neither have two coats apiece.","And whatsoever house ye enter into
 there abide and thence depart.","And whosoever will not receive you
 when ye go out of that city
 shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them.\u201d","But He said unto them
 \u201cGive ye them to eat.\u201d And they said
 \u201cWe have no more than five loaves and two fishes
 unless we should go and buy meat for all these people.\u201d","For they were about five thousand men. And He said to His disciples
 \u201cMake them sit down by fifties in a company.\u201d","And it came to pass as He was alone praying
 His disciples were with Him
 and He asked them
 saying
 \u201cWho say the people that I am?\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cBut who say ye that I am?\u201d Peter answering said
 \u201cThe Christ of God!\u201d","saying
 \u201cThe Son of Man must suffer many things
 and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and scribes
 and be slain and be raised the third day.\u201d","And He said to them all
 \u201cIf any man will come after Me
 let him deny himself and take up his cross daily
 and follow Me.","For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever will lose his life for My sake
 the same shall save it.","For what is a man advantaged if he gain the whole world
 and lose himself or be cast away?","For whosoever shall be ashamed of Me and of My words
 of him shall the Son of Man be ashamed when He shall come in His own glory and in His Father\u2019s and of the holy angels.","But I tell you in truth
 there are some standing here that shall not taste of death till they see the Kingdom of God.\u201d","And it came to pass as they departed from Him
 Peter said unto Jesus
 \u201cMaster
 it is good for us to be here; and let us make three tabernacles: one for Thee
 and one for Moses
 and one for Elijah\u201d \u2014 not knowing what he was saying.","And Jesus answering said
 \u201cO faithless and perverse generation
 how long shall I be with you and suffer you? Bring thy son hither.\u201d","\u201cLet these sayings sink down into your ears
 for the Son of Man shall be delivered into the hands of men.\u201d","and said unto them
 \u201cWhosoever shall receive this child in My name receiveth Me; and whosoever shall receive Me receiveth Him that sent Me. For he that is least among you all
 the same shall be great.\u201d","And Jesus said unto him
 \u201cForbid him not; for he that is not against us
 is for us.\u201d","And Jesus said unto him
 \u201cFoxes have holes
 and birds of the air have nests
 but the Son of Man hath nowhere to lay His head.\u201d","And He said unto another
 \u201cFollow Me.\u201d But he said
 \u201cLord
 suffer me first to go and bury my father.\u201d","Jesus said unto him
 \u201cLet the dead bury their dead
 but go thou and preach the Kingdom of God.\u201d","And Jesus said unto him
 \u201cNo man
 having put his hand to the plow and looking back
 is fit for the Kingdom of God.\u201d","Therefore He said unto them
 \u201cThe harvest truly is great
 but the laborers are few; pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest
 that He would send forth laborers into His harvest.","Go your ways; behold
 I send you forth as lambs among wolves
","carrying neither purse
 nor pack
 nor shoes; and salute no man by the way.","And into whatsoever house ye enter
 first say
 \u2018Peace be to this house.\u2019","And if the son of peace be there
 your peace shall rest upon it; if not
 it shall return to you again.","And in the same house remain
 eating and drinking such things as they give
 for the laborer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house.","And into whatsoever city ye enter and they receive you
 eat such things as are set before you.","And heal the sick that are therein and say unto them
 \u2018The Kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.\u2019","But into whatsoever city ye enter and they receive you not
 go your ways out into the streets of the same and say
","\u2018Even the very dust of your city
 which cleaveth on us
 we do wipe off against you. Notwithstanding
 be ye sure of this: that the Kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.\u2019","But I say unto you that it shall be more tolerable in that Day for Sodom than for that city.","\u201cWoe unto thee
 Chorazin! Woe unto thee
 Bethsaida! For if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon
 which have been done in you
 they would have a great while ago repented
 sitting in sackcloth and ashes.","But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the Judgment than for you.","And thou
 Capernaum
 which art exalted to heaven
 shall be thrust down to hell.","He that heareth you heareth Me
 and he that despiseth you despiseth Me
 and he that despiseth Me despiseth Him that sent Me.\u201d","And He said unto them
 \u201cI beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.","Behold
 I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy
 and nothing shall by any means hurt you.","Notwithstanding
 in this rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice because your names are written in Heaven.\u201d","In that hour Jesus rejoiced in Spirit and said
 \u201cI thank Thee
 O Father
 Lord of Heaven and earth

 and hast revealed them unto babes. Even so
 Father
 for so it seemed good in Thy sight.","All things are delivered to Me by My Father

 but the Father; and who the Father is
 but the Son and he to whom the Son will reveal Him.\u201d","And He turned unto His disciples and said privately
 \u201cBlessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see.","For I tell you that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see
 and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear
 and have not heard them.\u201d","And behold
 a certain lawyer stood up and tested Him
 saying
 \u201cMaster
 what shall I do to inherit eternal life?\u201d","He said unto him
 \u201cWhat is written in the law? How readest thou?\u201d","And He said unto him
 \u201cThou hast answered right; this do
 and thou shalt live.\u201d","And Jesus answering said
 \u201cA certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among thieves
 who stripped him of his raiment and wounded him and departed
 leaving him half dead.","And by chance there came down a certain priest that way. And when he saw him
 he passed by on the other side.","And likewise a Levite
 when he was at the place
 came and looked on him and passed by on the other side.","But a certain Samaritan
 as he journeyed
 came to where he was. And when he saw him he had compassion on him
","and went to him and bound up his wounds
 pouring on oil and wine; and he set him on his own beast
 and brought him to an inn and took care of him.","And on the morrow when he departed
 he took out two pence
 and gave them to the host and said unto him
 \u2018Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more
 when I come again I will repay thee.\u2019","Which now of these three
 thinkest thou
 was neighbor unto him that fell among the thieves?\u201d","And he said
 \u201cHe that showed mercy on him.\u201d Then said Jesus unto him
 \u201cGo and do thou likewise.\u201d","And Jesus answered and said unto her
 \u201cMartha
 Martha
 thou art anxious and troubled about many things.","But one thing is needful
 and Mary hath chosen that good part
 which shall not be taken away from her.\u201d","And it came to pass that as He was praying in a certain place
 when He ceased
 one of His disciples said unto Him
 \u201cLord
 teach us to pray as John also taught his disciples.\u201d","And He said unto them
 \u201cWhen ye pray
 say: Our Father who art in Heaven
 hallowed be Thy name. Thy Kingdom come. Thy will be done
 as in Heaven
 so on earth.","Give us day by day our daily bread.","And forgive us our sins
 for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation
 but deliver us from evil.\u201d","And He said unto them
 \u201cWhich of you shall have a friend and shall go unto him at midnight and say unto him
 \u2018Friend
 lend me three loaves
","for a friend of mine in his journey is come to me
 and I have nothing to set before him\u2019;","and he from within shall answer and say
 \u2018Trouble me not; the door is now shut and my children are with me in bed
 and I cannot rise and give to thee\u2019?","I say unto you
 though he will not rise and give to him because he is his friend
 yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth.","And I say unto you: ask
 and it shall be given you; seek
 and ye shall find; knock
 and it shall be opened unto you.","For every one that asketh receiveth
 and he that seeketh findeth
 and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.","\u201cIf a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father
 will he give him a stone? Or if he ask a fish
 will he for a fish give him a serpent?","Or if he shall ask for an egg
 will he offer him a scorpion?","If ye then
 being evil
 know how to give good gifts unto your children
 how much more shall your heavenly Father give the holy Spirit to them that ask Him?\u201d","And He was casting out a devil
 and it was dumb. And it came to pass when the devil had gone out
 the dumb one spoke; and the people wondered.","But He
 knowing their thoughts
 said unto them
 \u201cEvery kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house divided against a house falleth.","If Satan also be divided against himself
 how shall his kingdom stand \u2014 because ye say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub?","And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils
 by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore shall they be your judges.","But if I with the finger of God cast out devils
 doubt not the Kingdom of God is come upon you.","When a strong man armed keepeth his palace
 his goods are in peace.","But when one stronger than he shall come upon him and overcome him
 he taketh from him all his armor wherein he trusted
 and divideth his spoils.","He that is not with Me
 is against Me; and he that gathereth not with Me
 scattereth.","\u201cWhen the unclean spirit is gone out of a man
 he walketh through dry places seeking rest; and finding none
 he saith
 \u2018I will return unto my house whence I came out.\u2019","And when he cometh
 he findeth it swept and garnished.","Then he goeth and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself
 and they enter in and dwell there; and the last state of that man is worse than the first.\u201d","And it came to pass
 as He spoke these things
 a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice and said unto Him
 \u201cBlessed is the womb that bore Thee and the breasts which Thou hast sucked.\u201d","But He said
 \u201cYea rather
 blessed are they that hear the Word of God and keep it.\u201d","And when the people were gathered thick together
 He began to say
 \u201cThis is an evil generation. They seek a sign
 and there shall no sign be given it
 but the sign of Jonah the prophet.","For as Jonah was a sign unto the Ninevites
 so shall also the Son of Man be to this generation.","The queen of the south shall rise up in the Judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them
 for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold
 a greater than Solomon is here.","The men of Nineveh shall rise up in the Judgment with this generation and shall condemn it
 for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold
 a greater than Jonah is here.","\u201cNo man
 when he hath lighted a candle
 putteth it in a secret place
 neither under a bushel
 but on a candlestick
 that they that come in may see the light.","The light of the body is the eye. Therefore
 when thine eye is single
 thy whole body also is full of light. But when thine eye is evil
 thy body also is full of darkness.","Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness.","If thy whole body therefore be full of light
 having no part dark
 the whole shall be full of light
 as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light.\u201d","And the Lord said unto him
 \u201cNow do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter
 but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness.","Ye fools! Did not He that made that which is without
 make that which is within also?","But rather give alms of such things as ye have; and behold
 all things are clean unto you.","\u201cBut woe unto you
 Pharisees! For ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs
 and pass over judgment and the love of God. These ought ye to have done
 and not left the other undone.","Woe unto you
 Pharisees! For ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues and greetings in the markets.","Woe unto you
 scribes and Pharisees
 hypocrites! For ye are as graves which appear not
 and the men that walk over them are not aware of them.\u201d","And He said
 \u201cWoe unto you also
 ye lawyers! For ye laden men with burdens grievous to be borne
 and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers.","Woe unto you! For ye build the sepulchers of the prophets
 and your fathers killed them.","Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers; for they indeed killed them
 and ye build their sepulchers.","\u201cTherefore also said the wisdom of God: \u2018I will send them prophets and apostles
 and some of them they shall slay and persecute
\u2019","that the blood of all the prophets
 which was shed from the foundation of the world
 may be required of this generation
","from the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zechariah
 who perished between the altar and the temple. Verily I say unto you
 it shall be required of this generation.","Woe unto you
 lawyers! For ye have taken away the key of knowledge. Ye entered not in yourselves
 and them that were entering in
 ye hindered.\u201d","In the meantime
 when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people
 insomuch that they trod one upon another
 He began to say unto His disciples first of all
 \u201cBeware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees
 which is hypocrisy.","For there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed
 neither hid that shall not be known.","Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.","\u201cAnd I say unto you
 My friends
 be not afraid of them that kill the body
 and after that have no more that they can do.","But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear Him that
 after He hath killed
 hath power to cast into hell; yea
 I say unto you
 fear Him!","Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings
 and not one of them is forgotten before God?","But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows.","\u201cAlso I say unto you
 whosoever shall confess Me before men
 him shall the Son of Man also confess before the angels of God.","But he that denieth Me before men shall be denied before the angels of God.","And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of Man
 it shall be forgiven him; but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost
 it shall not be forgiven.","\u201cAnd when they bring you unto the synagogues
 and unto magistrates and powers
 take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer
 or what ye shall say.","For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say.\u201d","And He said unto him
 \u201cMan
 who made Me a judge or a divider over you?\u201d","And He said unto them
 \u201cTake heed and beware of covetousness
 for a man\u2019s life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.\u201d","And He spoke a parable unto them
 saying
 \u201cThe ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully.","And he thought within himself
 saying
 \u2018What shall I do
 because I have no room to store my fruits?\u2019","And he said
 \u2018This will I do. I will pull down my barns and build greater
 and there will I store all my fruits and my goods.","And I will say to my soul
 Soul
 thou hast much goods laid up for many years. Take thine ease; eat
 drink
 and be merry.\u2019","But God said unto him
 \u2018Thou fool
 this night thy soul shall be required of thee. Then whose shall those things be
 which thou hast provided?\u2019","So is he that layeth up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God.\u201d","And He said unto His disciples
 \u201cTherefore I say unto you
 take no thought for your life
 what ye shall eat; neither for the body
 what ye shall put on.","The life is more than meat
 and the body is more than raiment.","Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap
 they neither have storehouse nor barn
 and God feedeth them. How much more are ye better than the fowls?","And which of you by taking thought can add to his stature one cubit?","If ye then be not able to do that thing which is least
 why take ye thought for the rest?","Consider the lilies
 how they grow: they toil not
 they spin not; and yet I say unto you that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.","If then God so clothe the grass
 which is today in the field and tomorrow is cast into the oven
 how much more will He clothe you
 O ye of little faith?","\u201cAnd seek ye not what ye shall eat
 or what ye shall drink
 neither be ye of doubting mind.","For all these things do the nations of the world seek after
 and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things.","But rather seek ye the Kingdom of God
 and all these things shall be added unto you.","\u201cFear not
 little flock
 for it is your Father\u2019s good pleasure to give you the Kingdom.","Sell what ye have
 and give alms. Provide yourselves purses which wax not old
 a treasure in the heavens that faileth not
 where no thief approacheth
 neither moth corrupteth.","For where your treasure is
 there will your heart be also.","\u201cLet your loins be girded about and your lights burning;","and ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord when he will return from the wedding
 that when he cometh and knocketh
 they may open unto him immediately.","Blessed are those servants whom the lord
 when he cometh
 shall find watching. Verily I say unto you
 that he shall gird himself and make them to sit down to meat
 and will come forth and serve them.","And if he shall come in the second watch
 or come in the third watch and find them so
 blessed are those servants.","And this know
 that if the master of the house had known what hour the thief would come
 he would have watched and not have suffered his house to be broken into.","Be ye therefore ready also
 for the Son of Man cometh at an hour when ye think not.\u201d","And the Lord said
 \u201cWho then is that faithful and wise steward
 whom his lord shall make ruler over his household
 to give them their portion of meat in due season?","Blessed is that servant whom his lord
 when he cometh
 shall find so doing.","In truth I say unto you
 that he will make him ruler over all that he hath.","But if that servant say in his heart
 \u2018My lord delayeth his coming
\u2019 and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens
 and to eat and drink and be drunken
","the lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him
 and at an hour when he is not aware
 and will cut him asunder and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers.","And that servant
 who knew his lord\u2019s will and prepared not himself
 neither did according to his will
 shall be beaten with many stripes.","But he that knew not and committed things worthy of stripes
 shall be beaten with few stripes. For unto whomsoever much is given
 of him shall much be required; and to whom men have committed much
 of him they will ask the more.","\u201cI am come to send fire on the earth
 and what will I
 if it be already kindled?","But I have a baptism to be baptized with
 and how I am straitened till it be accomplished!","Suppose ye that I have come to give peace on earth? I tell you
 nay
 but rather division.","For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided: three against two
 and two against three.","The father shall be divided against the son and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter and the daughter against the mother; the mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.\u201d","And He said also to the people
 \u201cWhen ye see a cloud rise out of the west
 straightway ye say
 \u2018There cometh a shower\u2019; and so it is.","And when ye see the south wind blow
 ye say
 \u2018There will be heat\u2019; and it cometh to pass.","Ye hypocrites! Ye can discern the face of the sky and of the earth
 but how is it that ye do not discern this time?","\u201cYea
 and why even for yourselves judge ye not what is right?","When thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate
 as thou art on the way
 be diligent that thou mayest be delivered from him
 lest he hale thee to the judge
 and the judge deliver thee to the officer
 and the officer cast thee into prison.","I tell thee
 thou shall not depart thence till thou hast paid the very last mite.\u201d","And Jesus answering said unto them
 \u201cSuppose ye that these Galileans were sinners above all the other Galileans
 because they suffered such things?","I tell you
 nay; but unless ye repent
 ye shall all likewise perish.","Or those eighteen upon whom the tower of Siloam fell and slew them
 think ye that they were sinners above all other men that dwelt in Jerusalem?","I tell you
 nay; but unless ye repent
 ye shall all likewise perish.\u201d","He spoke also this parable: \u201cA certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard
 and he came and sought fruit thereon
 and found none.","Then said he unto the keeper of his vineyard
 \u2018Behold
 these three years I have come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none. Cut it down. Why cumbereth it the ground?\u2019","And he answering said unto him
 \u2018Lord
 let it alone this year also
 till I shall dig around it and dung it.","And if it bear fruit
 well; and if not
 then after that thou shalt cut it down.\u2019\u201d","And when Jesus saw her
 He called her to Him and said unto her
 \u201cWoman
 thou art loosed from thine infirmity.\u201d","The Lord then answered him and said
 \u201cThou hypocrite! Doth not each one of you on the Sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall and lead him away to watering?","And ought not this woman
 being a daughter of Abraham
 whom Satan hath bound
 lo
 these eighteen years
 be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath day?\u201d","Then said He
 \u201cUnto what is the Kingdom of God like? And unto what shall I compare it?","It is like a grain of mustard seed
 which a man took and cast into his garden; and it grew and waxed a great tree
 and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it.\u201d","And again He said
 \u201cUnto what shall I liken the Kingdom of God?","It is like leaven
 which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened.\u201d","Then said one unto Him
 \u201cLord
 are there few who are saved?\u201d And He said unto them
","\u201cStrive to enter in at the strait gate
 for many
 I say unto you
 will seek to enter in and shall not be able.","When once the master of the house is risen up and hath shut the door
 and ye begin to stand outside and to knock at the door
 saying
 \u2018Lord
 Lord
 open unto us
\u2019 and He shall answer and say unto you
 \u2018I know you not from whence ye are
\u2019","then shall ye begin to say
 \u2018We have eaten and drunk in Thy presence
 and Thou hast taught in our streets.\u2019","But He shall say
 \u2018I tell you
 I know you not from whence ye are. Depart from Me
 all ye workers of iniquity.\u2019","There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth when ye shall see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the Kingdom of God
 and you yourselves thrust out.","And they shall come from the east and from the west
 and from the north and from the south
 and shall sit down in the Kingdom of God.","And behold
 there are last which shall be first
 and there are first which shall be last.\u201d","And He said unto them
 \u201cGo ye and tell that fox
 \u2018Behold
 I cast out devils and I do cures today and tomorrow
 and the third day I shall be perfected.\u2019","Nevertheless I must walk today and tomorrow and the day following

 your house is left unto you desolate; and verily I say unto you
 ye shall not see Me until the time come when ye shall say
 \u2018Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord.\u2019\u201d","And Jesus answering
 spoke unto the lawyers and Pharisees
 saying
 \u201cIs it lawful to heal on the Sabbath day?\u201d","And He answered them
 saying
 \u201cWhich of you shall have an ox or an ass fallen into a pit

 and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.\u201d","Then said He also to him who bade Him
 \u201cWhen thou makest a dinner or a supper
 call not thy friends nor thy brethren
 neither thy kinsmen nor thy rich neighbors

 call the poor

 he said unto Him
 \u201cBlessed is he that shall eat bread in the Kingdom of God.\u201d","Then Jesus said unto him
 \u201cA certain man made a great supper and bade many.","And he sent his servant at suppertime to say to them that were bidden
 \u2018Come

 \u2018I have bought a piece of ground

 \u2018I have bought five yoke of oxen
 and I go to test them. I pray thee have me excused.\u2019","And another said
 \u2018I have married a wife

 being angry
 said to his servant

 \u2018Lord
 it is done as thou hast commanded

","\u201cIf any man come to Me and hate not his father and mother

 \u2018Father
 I have sinned against Heaven and in thy sight

 \u2018Bring forth the best robe and put it on him
 and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet.","And bring hither the fatted calf and kill it
 and let us eat and be merry;","for this my son was dead
 and is alive again; he was lost
 and is found.\u2019 And they began to be merry.","\u201cNow his elder son was in the field; and as he came and drew nigh to the house
 he heard music and dancing.","And he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant.","And he said unto him
 \u2018Thy brother is come

 thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.\u2019","And he said unto him
 \u2018Son
 thou art ever with me

 and is alive again; and was lost
 and is found.\u2019\u201d","And He said also unto His disciples
 \u201cThere was a certain rich man who had a steward

 \u2018How is it that I hear this of thee? Give an account of thy stewardship

 \u2018A hundred measures of oil.\u2019 And he said to him
 \u2018Take thy bill
 and sit down quickly and write fifty.\u2019","Then said he to another

 \u2018A hundred measures of wheat.\u2019 And he said unto him
 \u2018Take thy bill and write fourscore.\u2019","And the lord commended the unjust steward

 \u201cYe are they who justify yourselves before men
 but God knoweth your hearts. For that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.","\u201cThe Law and the Prophets were until John. Since that time the Kingdom of God is preached
 and every man presseth into it.","And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away
 than one tittle of the law to fail.","\u201cWhosoever putteth away his wife and marrieth another committeth adultery; and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth adultery.","\u201cThere was a certain rich man
 who was clothed in purple and fine linen and fared sumptuously every day.","And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus
 who was laid at his gate
 full of sores","and desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man\u2019s table. Moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.","And it came to pass that the beggar died
 and was carried by the angels into Abraham\u2019s bosom. The rich man also died
 and was buried.","And in hell
 being in torment
 he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham afar off and Lazarus in his bosom.","And he cried and said
 \u2018Father Abraham
 have mercy on me
 and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.\u2019","But Abraham said
 \u2018Son
 remember that thou in thy lifetime received thy good things
 and likewise Lazarus evil things; but now he is comforted and thou art tormented.","And besides all this
 between us and you there is a great gulf fixed
 so that they who would pass from here to you cannot; neither can they pass to us
 that would come from there.\u2019","Then he said
 \u2018I pray thee therefore
 father
 that thou wouldest send him to my father\u2019s house
","for I have five brethren
 that he may testify unto them lest they also come into this place of torment.\u2019","Abraham said unto him
 \u2018They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.\u2019","And he said
 \u2018Nay
 father Abraham; but if one went unto them from the dead
 they will repent.\u2019","And Abraham said unto him
 \u2018If they hear not Moses and the prophets
 neither will they be persuaded though one rose from the dead.\u2019\u201d","Then said He unto His disciples
 \u201cIt is impossible but that offenses will come
 but woe unto him through whom they come!","It were better for him that a millstone were hung about his neck and he cast into the sea
 than that he should cause one of these little ones to fall.","\u201cTake heed to yourselves. If thy brother trespass against thee
 rebuke him; and if he repent
 forgive him.","And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day
 and seven times in a day turn again to thee
 saying
 \u2018I repent
\u2019 thou shalt forgive him.\u201d","And the Lord said
 \u201cIf ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed
 ye might say unto this sycamine tree
 \u2018Be thou plucked up by the root
 and be thou planted in the sea
\u2019 and it should obey you.","But which of you
 having a servant plowing or feeding cattle
 will say unto him by and by when he is come from the field
 \u2018Go and sit down to meat\u2019?","But will you not rather say unto him
 \u2018Make ready wherewith I may sup
 and gird thyself and serve me until I have eaten and drunk
 and afterward thou shalt eat and drink\u2019?","Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I think not!","So likewise ye
 when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you
 say
 \u2018We are unprofitable servants. We have done that which was our duty to do.\u2019\u201d","And it came to pass as He went to Jerusalem that He passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.","And when He saw them
 He said unto them
 \u201cGo
 show yourselves unto the priests.\u201d And it came to pass that as they went
 they were cleansed.","And Jesus answering said
 \u201cWere there not ten cleansed? But where are the nine?","There are none found that returned to give glory to God
 save this stranger.\u201d","And He said unto him
 \u201cArise; go thy way. Thy faith hath made thee whole.\u201d","And when the Pharisees had demanded of Him when the Kingdom of God should come
 He answered them and said
 \u201cThe Kingdom of God cometh not with outward show.","Neither shall they say
 \u2018Lo
 it is here!\u2019 or \u2018Lo
 it is there!\u2019 For behold
 the Kingdom of God is within you.\u201d","And He said unto the disciples
 \u201cThe days will come when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man
 and ye shall not see it.","And they shall say to you
 \u2018See
 here!\u2019 or \u2018See
 there!\u2019 Go not after them
 nor follow them.","For as the lightning that lighteneth one part under heaven shineth unto the other part under heaven
 so shall also the Son of Man be in His day.","But first must He suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.","And as it was in the days of Noah
 so shall it be also in the days of the Son of Man:","They ate
 they drank
 they married wives
 they were given in marriage
 until the day that Noah entered into the ark
 and the flood came and destroyed them all.","\u201cLikewise also as it was in the days of Lot: They ate
 they drank
 they bought
 they sold
 they planted
 they built;","but the same day that Lot went out of Sodom
 it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all.","\u201cEven thus shall it be in the Day when the Son of Man is revealed.","In that Day
 he that shall be upon the housetop
 and his goods in the house
 let him not come down to take them away. And he that is in the field
 let him likewise not return back.","Remember Lot\u2019s wife.","Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it
 and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.","I tell you
 in that night there shall be two men in one bed; the one shall be taken
 and the other shall be left.","Two women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken
 and the other left.","And they answered and said unto Him
 \u201cWhere
 Lord?\u201d And He said unto them
 \u201cWheresoever the body is
 thither will the eagles be gathered together.\u201d","saying
 \u201cThere was in a city a judge who feared not God
 neither regarded man.","And there was a widow in that city
 and she came unto him
 saying
 \u2018Avenge me on mine adversary.\u2019","And for a while he would not
 but afterward he said within himself
 \u2018Though I fear not God nor regard man
","yet because this widow troubleth me I will avenge her
 lest by her continual coming she weary me.\u2019\u201d","And the Lord said
 \u201cHear what the unjust judge saith.","And shall not God avenge His own elect
 who cry day and night unto Him
 though He bear long with them?","I tell you that He will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of Man cometh
 shall He find faith on the earth?\u201d","\u201cTwo men went up into the temple to pray
 the one a Pharisee and the other a publican.","The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself
 \u2018God
 I thank Thee that I am not as other men are: extortioners
 unjust
 adulterers
 or even as this publican.","I fast twice in the week; I give tithes of all that I possess.\u2019","And the publican
 standing afar off
 would not so much as lift up his eyes unto heaven
 but smote upon his breast
 saying
 \u2018God
 be merciful to me a sinner!\u2019","I tell you
 this man went down to his house justified
 rather than the other; for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased
 and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.\u201d","But Jesus called them unto Him and said
 \u201cSuffer little children to come unto Me
 and forbid them not
 for of such is the Kingdom of God.","Verily I say unto you
 whosoever shall not receive the Kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.\u201d","And Jesus said unto him
 \u201cWhy callest thou Me good? None is good save One
 that is
 God.","Thou knowest the commandments: \u2018Do not commit adultery.\u2019 \u2018Do not kill.\u2019 \u2018Do not steal.\u2019 \u2018Do not bear false witness.\u2019 \u2018Honor thy father and thy mother.\u2019\u201d","And he said
 \u201cAll these have I kept from my youth up.\u201d","Now when Jesus heard these things
 He said unto him
 \u201cYet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast and distribute unto the poor
 and thou shalt have treasure in Heaven; and come
 follow Me.\u201d","And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful
 He said
 \u201cHow hardly shall they that have riches enter into the Kingdom of God!","For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle\u2019s eye
 than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God.\u201d","And He said
 \u201cThe things which are impossible with men are possible with God.\u201d","And He said unto them
 \u201cVerily I say unto you
 there is no man that hath left house or parents or brethren or wife or children for the Kingdom of God\u2019s sake
","who shall not receive manifold more in this present time
 and in the world to come life everlasting.\u201d","Then He took unto Him the twelve and said unto them
 \u201cBehold
 we go up to Jerusalem
 and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of Man shall be accomplished.","For He shall be delivered unto the Gentiles
 and shall be mocked and spitefully treated and spit upon;","and they shall scourge Him and put Him to death
 and the third day He shall rise again.\u201d","And they understood none of these things; and this saying was hidden from them
 neither knew they the things which were spoken.","saying
 \u201cWhat wilt thou that I shall do unto thee?\u201d And he said
 \u201cLord
 that I may receive my sight.\u201d","And Jesus said unto him
 \u201cReceive thy sight; thy faith hath saved thee.\u201d","And when Jesus came to the place
 He looked up and saw him
 and said unto him
 \u201cZacchaeus
 make haste and come down
 for today I must abide at thy house.\u201d","And Zacchaeus stood and said unto the Lord
 \u201cBehold
 Lord
 the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken anything from any man by false accusation
 I restore to him fourfold.\u201d","And Jesus said unto him
 \u201cThis day is salvation come to this house
 in that he also is a son of Abraham.","For the Son of Man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.\u201d","He said therefore
 \u201cA certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom
 and to return.","And he called his ten servants and delivered them ten pounds
 and said unto them
 \u2018Make use of it till I come.\u2019","But his citizens hated him and sent a message after him
 saying
 \u2018We will not have this man to reign over us.\u2019","And it came to pass that when he had returned
 having received the kingdom
 then he commanded these servants to be called unto him
 to whom he had given the money
 that he might know how much every man had gained by trading.","Then came the first
 saying
 \u2018Lord
 thy pound hath gained ten pounds.\u2019","And he said unto him
 \u2018Well done
 thou good servant; because thou hast been faithful in a very little
 have thou authority over ten cities.\u2019","And the second came
 saying
 \u2018Lord
 thy pound hath gained five pounds.\u2019","And he said likewise to him
 \u2018Be thou also over five cities.\u2019","And another came
 saying
 \u2018Lord
 behold
 here is thy pound
 which I have kept laid away in a napkin.","For I feared thee
 because thou art an austere man: thou takest up what thou layest not down
 and reapest what thou did not sow.\u2019","And he said unto him
 \u2018Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee
 thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere man
 taking up what I laid not down and reaping what I did not sow.","Why then gavest not thou my money unto the bank
 that at my coming I might have required mine own with interest?\u2019","And he said unto them that stood by
 \u2018Take from him the pound and give it to him that hath ten pounds.\u2019","(And they said unto him
 \u2018Lord
 he hath ten pounds!\u2019)","\u2018For I say unto you
 that unto every one that hath shall be given; and from him that hath not
 even that which he hath shall be taken away from him.","But those mine enemies
 who would not that I should reign over them
 bring them hither and slay them before me.\u2019\u201d","saying
 \u201cGo ye into the village opposite you
 in which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied
 whereon yet never man sat. Loose him and bring him hither.","And if any man ask you
 \u2018Why do ye loose him?\u2019 thus shall ye say unto him
 \u2018Because the Lord hath need of him.\u2019\u201d","And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto Him
 \u201cMaster
 rebuke thy disciples.\u201d","And He answered and said unto them
 \u201cI tell you that if these should hold their peace
 the stones would immediately cry out.\u201d","saying
 \u201cIf thou had known
 even thou
 at least in this thy day
 the things which must be for thy peace! But now they are hid from thine eyes.","For the days shall come upon thee that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee
 and compass thee around
 and keep thee in on every side.","And they shall lay thee even with the ground and thy children within thee; and they shalt not leave in thee one stone upon another
 because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.\u201d","saying unto them
 \u201cIt is written
 \u2018My house is the house of prayer
\u2019 but ye have made it a den of thieves.\u201d","And He answered and said unto them
 \u201cI will also ask you one thing
 and answer Me:","The baptism of John \u2014 was it from Heaven
 or of men?\u201d","And Jesus said unto them
 \u201cNeither tell I you by what authority I do these things.\u201d","Then He began to speak to the people this parable: \u201cA certain man planted a vineyard and let it out to husbandmen
 and went into a far country for a long time.","And at the season
 he sent a servant to the husbandmen
 that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard; but the husbandmen beat him and sent him away empty.","And again he sent another servant; and they beat him also
 and treated him shamefully
 and sent him away empty.","And again he sent a third; and they wounded him also and cast him out.","Then said the lord of the vineyard
 \u2018What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; it may be they will reverence him when they see him.\u2019","But when the husbandmen saw him
 they reasoned among themselves
 saying
 \u2018This is the heir; come
 let us kill him
 that the inheritance may be ours.\u2019","So they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him. What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them?","He shall come and destroy these husbandmen and shall give the vineyard to others.\u201d And when they heard it they said
 \u201cGod forbid!\u201d","And He beheld them and said
 \u201cWhat is this then that is written: \u2018The stone which the builders rejected
 the same is become the head of the corner\u2019?","Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall
 it will grind him to powder.\u201d","And they watched Him and sent forth spies
 who should feign themselves to be just men
 that they might take hold of His words and so they might deliver Him unto the power and authority of the governor.","Show Me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it?\u201d They answered and said
 \u201cCaesar\u2019s.\u201d","And He said unto them
 \u201cRender therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar\u2019s
 and unto God the things which are God\u2019s.\u201d","And they could not take hold of His words before the people. And they marveled at His answer and held their peace.","And Jesus answering said unto them
 \u201cThe children of this world marry and are given in marriage.","But they that shall be accounted worthy to obtain that World and the resurrection from the dead
 neither marry nor are given in marriage
","neither can they die any more; for they are equal unto the angels and are the children of God
 being the children of the resurrection.","Now that the dead are raised
 even Moses showed at the bush when he called the Lord \u2018the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.\u2019","For He is not a God of the dead
 but of the living
 for all live unto Him.\u201d","And He said unto them
 \u201cHow say they that Christ is David\u2019s son?","For David himself saith in the book of Psalms: \u2018The Lord said unto my Lord
 \u201cSit Thou on My right hand
","until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool.\u201d\u2019","If David therefore calleth Him \u2018Lord
\u2019 how is He then his son?\u201d","\u201cBeware of the scribes who desire to walk in long robes
 and love greetings in the markets
 and the highest seats in the synagogues
 and the chief rooms at feasts;","who devour widows\u2019 houses
 and for a show make long prayers. The same shall receive greater damnation.\u201d","And He said
 \u201cIn truth I say unto you that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all.","For all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of God
 but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had.\u201d","\u201cAs for these things which ye behold
 the days will come in which there shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down.\u201d","And He said
 \u201cTake heed that ye be not deceived
 for many shall come in My name
 saying
 \u2018I am Christ
\u2019 and
 \u2018the time draweth near.\u2019 Go ye not therefore after them.","But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions
 be not terrified
 for these things must first come to pass. But the end is not at once.\u201d","Then said He unto them
 \u201cNation shall rise against nation
 and kingdom against kingdom
","and great earthquakes shall be in divers places
 and famines and pestilences. And fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven.","But before all these
 they shall lay their hands on you and persecute you
 delivering you up to the synagogues and into prisons
 and you will be brought before kings and rulers for My name\u2019s sake.","And it shall turn to you to bear testimony.","Settle it therefore in your hearts not to meditate beforehand what ye shall answer.","For I will give you a mouth and wisdom
 which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist.","And ye shall be betrayed both by parents and brethren and kinsfolk and friends
 and some of you they shall cause to be put to death.","And ye shall be hated by all men for My name\u2019s sake.","But there shall not a hair of your head perish.","In your patience possess ye your souls.","\u201cAnd when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies
 then know that the desolation thereof is nigh.","Then let them that are in Judea flee to the mountains
 and let them that are in the midst of it depart out
 and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto.","For these are the days of vengeance
 that all things which are written may be fulfilled.","But woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days! For there shall be great distress in the land and wrath upon this people.","And they shall fall by the edge of the sword
 and shall be led away captive into all nations. And Jerusalem shall be trodden down by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.","\u201cAnd there shall be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars; and upon the earth distress among nations
 with perplexity
 the sea and the waves roaring.","Men\u2019s hearts will fail them for fear and for looking upon those things which are coming on the earth; for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.","And then shall they see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.","And when these things begin to come to pass
 then look up and lift up your heads
 for your redemption draweth nigh.\u201d","And He spoke to them a parable: \u201cBehold the fig tree and all the trees.","When they now shoot forth
 ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand.","So likewise ye
 when ye see these things come to pass
 know ye that the Kingdom of God is nigh at hand.","Verily I say unto you
 this generation shall not pass away
 till all be fulfilled.","Heaven and earth shall pass away
 but My words shall not pass away.","\u201cAnd take heed to yourselves
 lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness and cares of this life
 and so that Day come upon you unawares.","For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth.","Watch ye therefore
 and pray always
 that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass
 and to stand before the Son of Man.\u201d","And He sent Peter and John

 \u201cGo and prepare us the Passover

 \u201cWith desire I have desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer;","for I say unto you
 I will not anymore eat thereof until it be fulfilled in the Kingdom of God.\u201d","And He took the cup
 and gave thanks and said
 \u201cTake this
 and divide it among yourselves;","for I say unto you

 as ye see Me to have.\u201d","And while they yet believed not for joy
 and wondered
 He said unto them
 \u201cHave ye here any meat?\u201d","And He said unto them
 \u201cThese are the words which I spoke unto you while I was yet with you
 that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the Law of Moses and in the Prophets and in the Psalms concerning Me.\u201d","and said unto them
 \u201cThus it is written
 and thus it behooved Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day
","and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His name among all nations
 beginning at Jerusalem.","And ye are witnesses of these things.","And behold
 I send the promise of My Father upon you; but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem until ye be endued with power from on high.\u201d","And he said unto them
 How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?","And Jesus answered him
 saying
 It is written
 That man shall not live by bread alone
 but by every word of God.","And the devil said unto him
 All this power will I give thee
 and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it.","And Jesus answered and said unto him
 Get thee behind me
 Satan: for it is written
 Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God
 and him only shalt thou serve.","And he brought him to Jerusalem
 and set him on a pinnacle of the temple
 and said unto him
 If thou be the Son of God
 cast thyself down from hence:","And Jesus answering said unto him
 It is said
 Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.","The Spirit of the Lord is upon me
 because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted
 to preach deliverance to the captives
 and recovering of sight to the blind
 to set at liberty them that are bruised
","To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.","And he began to say unto them
 This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.","And he said unto them
 Ye will surely say unto me this proverb
 Physician
 heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum
 do also here in thy country.","And he said
 Verily I say unto you
 No prophet is accepted in his own country.","But I tell you of a truth
 many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias
 when the heaven was shut up three years and six months
 when great famine was throughout all the land;","But unto none of them was Elias sent
 save unto Sarepta
 a city of Sidon
 unto a woman that was a widow.","And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet; and none of them was cleansed
 saving Naaman the Syrian.","And they were astonished at his doctrine: for his word was with power.","And Jesus rebuked him
 saying
 Hold thy peace
 and come out of him. And when the devil had thrown him in the midst
 he came out of him
 and hurt him not.","And devils also came out of many
 crying out
 and saying
 Thou art Christ the Son of God. And he rebuking them suffered them not to speak: for they knew that he was Christ.","And he said unto them
 I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also: for therefore am I sent.","Now when he had left speaking
 he said unto Simon
 Launch out into the deep
 and let down your nets for a draught.","And so was also James
 and John
 the sons of Zebedee
 which were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon
 Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men.","And he put forth his hand
 and touched him
 saying
 I will: be thou clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him.","And he charged him to tell no man: but go
 and shew thyself to the priest
 and offer for thy cleansing
 according as Moses commanded
 for a testimony unto them.","And when he saw their faith
 he said unto him
 Man
 thy sins are forgiven thee.","But when Jesus perceived their thoughts
 he answering said unto them
 What reason ye in your hearts?","Whether is easier
 to say
 Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say
 Rise up and walk?","But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins
 (he said unto the sick of the palsy
) I say unto thee
 Arise
 and take up thy couch
 and go into thine house.","And after these things he went forth
 and saw a publican
 named Levi
 sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto him
 Follow me.","And Jesus answering said unto them
 They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick.","I came not to call the righteous
 but sinners to repentance.","And they said unto him
 Why do the disciples of John fast often
 and make prayers
 and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees; but thine eat and drink?","And he said unto them
 Can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast
 while the bridegroom is with them?","But the days will come
 when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them
 and then shall they fast in those days.","And he spake also a parable unto them; No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old; if otherwise
 then both the new maketh a rent
 and the piece that was taken out of the new agreeth not with the old.","And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine will burst the bottles
 and be spilled
 and the bottles shall perish.","But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved.","No man also having drunk old wine straightway desireth new: for he saith
 The old is better.","And Jesus answering them said
 Have ye not read so much as this
 what David did
 when himself was an hungred
 and they which were with him;","How he went into the house of God
 and did take and eat the shewbread
 and gave also to them that were with him; which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone?","And he said unto them
 That the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.","But he knew their thoughts
 and said to the man which had the withered hand
 Rise up
 and stand forth in the midst. And he arose and stood forth.","Then said Jesus unto them
 I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good
 or to do evil? to save life
 or to destroy it?","And looking round about upon them all
 he said unto the man
 Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was restored whole as the other.","Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed are ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh.","Blessed are ye
 when men shall hate you
 and when they shall separate you from their company
 and shall reproach you
 and cast out your name as evil
 for the Son of man's sake.","Rejoice ye in that day
 and leap for joy: for
 behold
 your reward is great in heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets.","But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation.","Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.","Woe unto you
 when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets.","But I say unto you which hear
 Love your enemies
 do good to them which hate you
","Bless them that curse you
 and pray for them which despitefully use you.","And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat also.","Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again.","And as ye would that men should do to you
 do ye also to them likewise.","For if ye love them which love you
 what thank have ye? for sinners also love those that love them.","And if ye do good to them which do good to you
 what thank have ye? for sinners also do even the same.","And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive
 what thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners
 to receive as much again.","But love ye your enemies
 and do good
 and lend
 hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great
 and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil.","Be ye therefore merciful
 as your Father also is merciful.","Judge not
 and ye shall not be judged: condemn not
 and ye shall not be condemned: forgive
 and ye shall be forgiven:","Give
 and it shall be given unto you; good measure
 pressed down
 and shaken together
 and running over
 shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.","And he spake a parable unto them
 Can the blind lead the blind? shall they not both fall into the ditch?","The disciple is not above his master: but every one that is perfect shall be as his master.","And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye
 but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye?","Either how canst thou say to thy brother
 Brother
 let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye
 when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite
 cast out first the beam out of thine own eye
 and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother's eye.","For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.","For every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs
 nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes.","A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.","And why call ye me
 Lord
 Lord
 and do not the things which I say?","Whosoever cometh to me
 and heareth my sayings
 and doeth them
 I will shew you to whom he is like:","He is like a man which built an house
 and digged deep
 and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose
 the stream beat vehemently upon that house
 and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock.","But he that heareth
 and doeth not
 is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently
 and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.","When Jesus heard these things
 he marvelled at him
 and turned him about
 and said unto the people that followed him
 I say unto you
 I have not found so great faith
 no
 not in Israel.","And when the Lord saw her
 he had compassion on her
 and said unto her
 Weep not.","And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him stood still. And he said
 Young man
 I say unto thee
 Arise.","Then Jesus answering said unto them
 Go your way
 and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see
 the lame walk
 the lepers are cleansed
 the deaf hear
 the dead are raised
 to the poor the gospel is preached.","And blessed is he
 whosoever shall not be offended in me.","And when the messengers of John were departed
 he began to speak unto the people concerning John
 What went ye out into the wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind?","But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold
 they which are gorgeously apparelled
 and live delicately
 are in kings' courts.","But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea
 I say unto you
 and much more than a prophet.","This is he
 of whom it is written
 Behold
 I send my messenger before thy face
 which shall prepare thy way before thee.","For I say unto you
 Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.","And the Lord said
 Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like?","They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace
 and calling one to another
 and saying
 We have piped unto you
 and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you
 and ye have not wept.","For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say
 He hath a devil.","The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say
 Behold a gluttonous man
 and a winebibber
 a friend of publicans and sinners!","But wisdom is justified of all her children.","Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it
 he spake within himself
 saying
 This man
 if he were a prophet
 would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him: for she is a sinner.","And Jesus answering said unto him
 Simon
 I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith
 Master
 say on.","There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence
 and the other fifty.","And when they had nothing to pay
 he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore
 which of them will love him most?","Simon answered and said
 I suppose that he
 to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him
 Thou hast rightly judged.","And he turned to the woman
 and said unto Simon
 Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house
 thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears
 and wiped them with the hairs of her head.","Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet.","My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment.","Wherefore I say unto thee
 Her sins
 which are many
 are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven
 the same loveth little.","And he said unto her
 Thy sins are forgiven.","And he said to the woman
 Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.","And when much people were gathered together
 and were come to him out of every city
 he spake by a parable:","A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed
 some fell by the way side; and it was trodden down
 and the fowls of the air devoured it.","And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up
 it withered away
 because it lacked moisture.","And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it
 and choked it.","And other fell on good ground
 and sprang up
 and bare fruit an hundredfold. And when he had said these things
 he cried
 He that hath ears to hear
 let him hear.","And he said
 Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see
 and hearing they might not understand.","Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.","Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil
 and taketh away the word out of their hearts
 lest they should believe and be saved.","They on the rock are they
 which
 when they hear
 receive the word with joy; and these have no root
 which for a while believe
 and in time of temptation fall away.","And that which fell among thorns are they
 which
 when they have heard
 go forth
 and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life
 and bring no fruit to perfection.","But that on the good ground are they
 which in an honest and good heart
 having heard the word
 keep it
 and bring forth fruit with patience.","No man
 when he hath lighted a candle
 covereth it with a vessel
 or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a candlestick
 that they which enter in may see the light.","For nothing is secret
 that shall not be made manifest; neither any thing hid
 that shall not be known and come abroad.","Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath
 to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not
 from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have.","And it was told him by certain which said
 Thy mother and thy brethren stand without
 desiring to see thee.","And he answered and said unto them
 My mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God
 and do it.","Now it came to pass on a certain day
 that he went into a ship with his disciples: and he said unto them
 Let us go over unto the other side of the lake. And they launched forth.","And he said unto them
 Where is your faith? And they being afraid wondered
 saying one to another
 What manner of man is this! for he commandeth even the winds and water
 and they obey him.","And Jesus asked him
 saying
 What is thy name? And he said
 Legion: because many devils were entered into him.","Return to thine own house
 and shew how great things God hath done unto thee. And he went his way
 and published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him.","And Jesus said
 Who touched me? When all denied
 Peter and they that were with him said
 Master
 the multitude throng thee and press thee
 and sayest thou
 Who touched me?","And Jesus said
 Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.","And he said unto her
 Daughter
 be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.","But when Jesus heard it
 he answered him
 saying
 Fear not: believe only
 and she shall be made whole.","And all wept
 and bewailed her: but he said
 Weep not; she is not dead
 but sleepeth.","And he put them all out
 and took her by the hand
 and called
 saying
 Maid
 arise.","And he said unto them
 Take nothing for your journey
 neither staves
 nor scrip
 neither bread
 neither money; neither have two coats apiece.","And whatsoever house ye enter into
 there abide
 and thence depart.","And whosoever will not receive you
 when ye go out of that city
 shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them.","But he said unto them
 Give ye them to eat. And they said
 We have no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy meat for all this people.","For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples
 Make them sit down by fifties in a company.","And it came to pass
 as he was alone praying
 his disciples were with him: and he asked them
 saying
 Whom say the people that I am?","He said unto them
 But whom say ye that I am? Peter answering said
 The Christ of God.","Saying
 The Son of man must suffer many things
 and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes
 and be slain
 and be raised the third day.","And he said to them all
 If any man will come after me
 let him deny himself
 and take up his cross daily
 and follow me.","For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his life for my sake
 the same shall save it.","For what is a man advantaged
 if he gain the whole world
 and lose himself
 or be cast away?","For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words
 of him shall the Son of man be ashamed
 when he shall come in his own glory
 and in his Father's
 and of the holy angels.","But I tell you of a truth
 there be some standing here
 which shall not taste of death
 till they see the kingdom of God.","And it came to pass
 as they departed from him
 Peter said unto Jesus
 Master
 it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee
 and one for Moses
 and one for Elias: not knowing what he said.","And Jesus answering said
 O faithless and perverse generation
 how long shall I be with you
 and suffer you? Bring thy son hither.","Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men.","And said unto them
 Whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all
 the same shall be great.","And Jesus said unto him
 Forbid him not: for he that is not against us is for us.","And Jesus said unto him
 Foxes have holes
 and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.","And he said unto another
 Follow me. But he said
 Lord
 suffer me first to go and bury my father.","Jesus said unto him
 Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God.","And Jesus said unto him
 No man
 having put his hand to the plough
 and looking back
 is fit for the kingdom of God.","Therefore said he unto them
 The harvest truly is great
 but the labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest
 that he would send forth labourers into his harvest.","Go your ways: behold
 I send you forth as lambs among wolves.","Carry neither purse
 nor scrip
 nor shoes: and salute no man by the way.","And into whatsoever house ye enter
 first say
 Peace be to this house.","And if the son of peace be there
 your peace shall rest upon it: if not
 it shall turn to you again.","And in the same house remain
 eating and drinking such things as they give: for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house.","And into whatsoever city ye enter
 and they receive you
 eat such things as are set before you:","And heal the sick that are therein
 and say unto them
 The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.","But into whatsoever city ye enter
 and they receive you not
 go your ways out into the streets of the same
 and say
","Even the very dust of your city
 which cleaveth on us
 we do wipe off against you: notwithstanding be ye sure of this
 that the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.","But I say unto you
 that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom
 than for that city.","Woe unto thee
 Chorazin! woe unto thee
 Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon
 which have been done in you
 they had a great while ago repented
 sitting in sackcloth and ashes.","But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment
 than for you.","And thou
 Capernaum
 which art exalted to heaven
 shalt be thrust down to hell.","He that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me.","And he said unto them
 I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.","Behold
 I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions
 and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.","Notwithstanding in this rejoice not
 that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice
 because your names are written in heaven.","In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit
 and said
 I thank thee
 O Father
 Lord of heaven and earth
 that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent
 and hast revealed them unto babes: even so
 Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight.","All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knoweth who the Son is
 but the Father; and who the Father is
 but the Son
 and he to whom the Son will reveal him.","And he turned him unto his disciples
 and said privately
 Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see:","For I tell you
 that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see
 and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear
 and have not heard them.","And
 behold
 a certain lawyer stood up
 and tempted him
 saying
 Master
 what shall I do to inherit eternal life?","He said unto him
 What is written in the law? how readest thou?","And he said unto him
 Thou hast answered right: this do
 and thou shalt live.","And Jesus answering said
 A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho
 and fell among thieves
 which stripped him of his raiment
 and wounded him
 and departed
 leaving him half dead.","And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him
 he passed by on the other side.","And likewise a Levite
 when he was at the place
 came and looked on him
 and passed by on the other side.","But a certain Samaritan
 as he journeyed
 came where he was: and when he saw him
 he had compassion on him
","And went to him
 and bound up his wounds
 pouring in oil and wine
 and set him on his own beast
 and brought him to an inn
 and took care of him.","And on the morrow when he departed
 he took out two pence
 and gave them to the host
 and said unto him
 Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more
 when I come again
 I will repay thee.","Which now of these three
 thinkest thou
 was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves?","And he said
 He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him
 Go
 and do thou likewise.","And Jesus answered and said unto her
 Martha
 Martha
 thou art careful and troubled about many things:","But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part
 which shall not be taken away from her.","And it came to pass
 that
 as he was praying in a certain place
 when he ceased
 one of his disciples said unto him
 Lord
 teach us to pray
 as John also taught his disciples.","And he said unto them
 When ye pray
 say
 Our Father which art in heaven
 Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done
 as in heaven
 so in earth.","Give us day by day our daily bread.","And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil.","And he said unto them
 Which of you shall have a friend
 and shall go unto him at midnight
 and say unto him
 Friend
 lend me three loaves;","For a friend of mine in his journey is come to me
 and I have nothing to set before him?","And he from within shall answer and say
 Trouble me not: the door is now shut
 and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee.","I say unto you
 Though he will not rise and give him
 because he is his friend
 yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth.","And I say unto you
 Ask
 and it shall be given you; seek
 and ye shall find; knock
 and it shall be opened unto you.","For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.","If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father
 will he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish
 will he for a fish give him a serpent?","Or if he shall ask an egg
 will he offer him a scorpion?","If ye then
 being evil
 know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?","And he was casting out a devil
 and it was dumb. And it came to pass
 when the devil was gone out
 the dumb spake; and the people wondered.","But he
 knowing their thoughts
 said unto them
 Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house divided against a house falleth.","If Satan also be divided against himself
 how shall his kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub.","And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils
 by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges.","But if I with the finger of God cast out devils
 no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you.","When a strong man armed keepeth his palace
 his goods are in peace:","But when a stronger than he shall come upon him
 and overcome him
 he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted
 and divideth his spoils.","He that is not with me is against me: and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.","When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man
 he walketh through dry places
 seeking rest; and finding none
 he saith
 I will return unto my house whence I came out.","And when he cometh
 he findeth it swept and garnished.","Then goeth he
 and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and they enter in
 and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first.","And it came to pass
 as he spake these things
 a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice
 and said unto him
 Blessed is the womb that bare thee
 and the paps which thou hast sucked.","But he said
 Yea rather
 blessed are they that hear the word of God
 and keep it.","And when the people were gathered thick together
 he began to say
 This is an evil generation: they seek a sign; and there shall no sign be given it
 but the sign of Jonas the prophet.","For as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites
 so shall also the Son of man be to this generation.","The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation
 and condemn them: for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and
 behold
 a greater than Solomon is here.","The men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this generation
 and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and
 behold
 a greater than Jonas is here.","No man
 when he hath lighted a candle
 putteth it in a secret place
 neither under a bushel
 but on a candlestick
 that they which come in may see the light.","The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single
 thy whole body also is full of light; but when thine eye is evil
 thy body also is full of darkness.","Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness.","If thy whole body therefore be full of light
 having no part dark
 the whole shall be full of light
 as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light.","And the Lord said unto him
 Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness.","Ye fools
 did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also?","But rather give alms of such things as ye have; and
 behold
 all things are clean unto you.","But woe unto you
 Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs
 and pass over judgment and the love of God: these ought ye to have done
 and not to leave the other undone.","Woe unto you
 Pharisees! for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues
 and greetings in the markets.","Woe unto you
 scribes and Pharisees
 hypocrites! for ye are as graves which appear not
 and the men that walk over them are not aware of them.","And he said
 Woe unto you also
 ye lawyers! for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne
 and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers.","Woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets
 and your fathers killed them.","Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers: for they indeed killed them
 and ye build their sepulchres.","Therefore also said the wisdom of God
 I will send them prophets and apostles
 and some of them they shall slay and persecute:","That the blood of all the prophets
 which was shed from the foundation of the world
 may be required of this generation;","From the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias which perished between the altar and the temple: verily I say unto you
 It shall be required of this generation.","Woe unto you
 lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves
 and them that were entering in ye hindered.","In the mean time
 when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people
 insomuch that they trode one upon another
 he began to say unto his disciples first of all
 Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees
 which is hypocrisy.","For there is nothing covered
 that shall not be revealed; neither hid
 that shall not be known.","Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.","And I say unto you my friends
 Be not afraid of them that kill the body
 and after that have no more that they can do.","But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him
 which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea
 I say unto you
 Fear him.","Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings
 and not one of them is forgotten before God?","But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows.","Also I say unto you
 Whosoever shall confess me before men
 him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God:","But he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels of God.","And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man
 it shall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven.","And when they bring you unto the synagogues
 and unto magistrates
 and powers
 take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer
 or what ye shall say:","For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say.","And he said unto him
 Man
 who made me a judge or a divider over you?","And he said unto them
 Take heed
 and beware of covetousness: for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.","And he spake a parable unto them
 saying
 The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully:","And he thought within himself
 saying
 What shall I do
 because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?","And he said
 This will I do: I will pull down my barns
 and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods.","And I will say to my soul
 Soul
 thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease
 eat
 drink
 and be merry.","But God said unto him
 Thou fool
 this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be
 which thou hast provided?","So is he that layeth up treasure for himself
 and is not rich toward God.","And he said unto his disciples
 Therefore I say unto you
 Take no thought for your life
 what ye shall eat; neither for the body
 what ye shall put on.","The life is more than meat
 and the body is more than raiment.","Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth them: how much more are ye better than the fowls?","And which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit?","If ye then be not able to do that thing which is least
 why take ye thought for the rest?","Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not
 they spin not; and yet I say unto you
 that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.","If then God so clothe the grass
 which is to day in the field
 and to morrow is cast into the oven; how much more will he clothe you
 O ye of little faith?","And seek not ye what ye shall eat
 or what ye shall drink
 neither be ye of doubtful mind.","For all these things do the nations of the world seek after: and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things.","But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things shall be added unto you.","Fear not
 little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.","Sell that ye have
 and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old
 a treasure in the heavens that faileth not
 where no thief approacheth
 neither moth corrupteth.","For where your treasure is
 there will your heart be also.","Let your loins be girded about
 and your lights burning;","And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord
 when he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh
 they may open unto him immediately.","Blessed are those servants
 whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching: verily I say unto you
 that he shall gird himself
 and make them to sit down to meat
 and will come forth and serve them.","And if he shall come in the second watch
 or come in the third watch
 and find them so
 blessed are those servants.","And this know
 that if the goodman of the house had known what hour the thief would come
 he would have watched
 and not have suffered his house to be broken through.","Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not.","And the Lord said
 Who then is that faithful and wise steward
 whom his lord shall make ruler over his household
 to give them their portion of meat in due season?","Blessed is that servant
 whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing.","Of a truth I say unto you
 that he will make him ruler over all that he hath.","But and if that servant say in his heart
 My lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens
 and to eat and drink
 and to be drunken;","The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him
 and at an hour when he is not aware
 and will cut him in sunder
 and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers.","And that servant
 which knew his lord's will
 and prepared not himself
 neither did according to his will
 shall be beaten with many stripes.","But he that knew not
 and did commit things worthy of stripes
 shall be beaten with few stripes. For unto whomsoever much is given
 of him shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much
 of him they will ask the more.","I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I
 if it be already kindled?","But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished!","Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you
 Nay; but rather division:","For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided
 three against two
 and two against three.","The father shall be divided against the son
 and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter
 and the daughter against the mother; the mother in law against her daughter in law
 and the daughter in law against her mother in law.","And he said also to the people
 When ye see a cloud rise out of the west
 straightway ye say
 There cometh a shower; and so it is.","And when ye see the south wind blow
 ye say
 There will be heat; and it cometh to pass.","Ye hypocrites
 ye can discern the face of the sky and of the earth; but how is it that ye do not discern this time?","Yea
 and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right?","When thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate
 as thou art in the way
 give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him; lest he hale thee to the judge
 and the judge deliver thee to the officer
 and the officer cast thee into prison.","I tell thee
 thou shalt not depart thence
 till thou hast paid the very last mite.","And Jesus answering said unto them
 Suppose ye that these Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans
 because they suffered such things?","I tell you
 Nay: but
 except ye repent
 ye shall all likewise perish.","Or those eighteen
 upon whom the tower in Siloam fell
 and slew them
 think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem?","I tell you
 Nay: but
 except ye repent
 ye shall all likewise perish.","He spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon
 and found none.","Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard
 Behold
 these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree
 and find none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground?","And he answering said unto him
 Lord
 let it alone this year also
 till I shall dig about it
 and dung it:","And if it bear fruit
 well: and if not
 then after that thou shalt cut it down.","And when Jesus saw her
 he called her to him
 and said unto her
 Woman
 thou art loosed from thine infirmity.","The Lord then answered him
 and said
 Thou hypocrite
 doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall
 and lead him away to watering?","And ought not this woman
 being a daughter of Abraham
 whom Satan hath bound
 lo
 these eighteen years
 be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day?","Then said he
 Unto what is the kingdom of God like? and whereunto shall I resemble it?","It is like a grain of mustard seed
 which a man took
 and cast into his garden; and it grew
 and waxed a great tree; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it.","And again he said
 Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God?","It is like leaven
 which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal
 till the whole was leavened.","Then said one unto him
 Lord
 are there few that be saved? And he said unto them
","Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many
 I say unto you
 will seek to enter in
 and shall not be able.","When once the master of the house is risen up
 and hath shut to the door
 and ye begin to stand without
 and to knock at the door
 saying
 Lord
 Lord
 open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto you
 I know you not whence ye are:","Then shall ye begin to say
 We have eaten and drunk in thy presence
 and thou hast taught in our streets.","But he shall say
 I tell you
 I know you not whence ye are; depart from me
 all ye workers of iniquity.","There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth
 when ye shall see Abraham
 and Isaac
 and Jacob
 and all the prophets
 in the kingdom of God
 and you yourselves thrust out.","And they shall come from the east
 and from the west
 and from the north
 and from the south
 and shall sit down in the kingdom of God.","And
 behold
 there are last which shall be first
 and there are first which shall be last.","And he said unto them
 Go ye
 and tell that fox
 Behold
 I cast out devils
 and I do cures to day and to morrow
 and the third day I shall be perfected.","Nevertheless I must walk to day
 and to morrow
 and the day following: for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem.","O Jerusalem
 Jerusalem
 which killest the prophets
 and stonest them that are sent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy children together
 as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings
 and ye would not!","Behold
 your house is left unto you desolate: and verily I say unto you
 Ye shall not see me
 until the time come when ye shall say
 Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.","And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees
 saying
 Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day?","And answered them
 saying
 Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit
 and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day?","When thou art bidden of any man to a wedding
 sit not down in the highest room; lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him;","And he that bade thee and him come and say to thee
 Give this man place; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room.","But when thou art bidden
 go and sit down in the lowest room; that when he that bade thee cometh
 he may say unto thee
 Friend
 go up higher: then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee.","For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.","Then said he also to him that bade him
 When thou makest a dinner or a supper
 call not thy friends
 nor thy brethren
 neither thy kinsmen
 nor thy rich neighbours; lest they also bid thee again
 and a recompence be made thee.","But when thou makest a feast
 call the poor
 the maimed
 the lame
 the blind:","And thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.","And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things
 he said unto him
 Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.","Then said he unto him
 A certain man made a great supper
 and bade many:","And sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden
 Come; for all things are now ready.","And they all with one consent began to make excuse. The first said unto him
 I have bought a piece of ground
 and I must needs go and see it: I pray thee have me excused.","And another said
 I have bought five yoke of oxen
 and I go to prove them: I pray thee have me excused.","And another said
 I have married a wife
 and therefore I cannot come.","So that servant came
 and shewed his lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant
 Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city
 and bring in hither the poor
 and the maimed
 and the halt
 and the blind.","And the servant said
 Lord
 it is done as thou hast commanded
 and yet there is room.","And the lord said unto the servant
 Go out into the highways and hedges
 and compel them to come in
 that my house may be filled.","For I say unto you
 That none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper.","And there went great multitudes with him: and he turned
 and said unto them
","If any man come to me
 and hate not his father
 and mother
 and wife
 and children
 and brethren
 and sisters
 yea
 and his own life also
 he cannot be my disciple.","And whosoever doth not bear his cross
 and come after me
 cannot be my disciple.","For which of you
 intending to build a tower
 sitteth not down first
 and counteth the cost
 whether he have sufficient to finish it?","Lest haply
 after he hath laid the foundation
 and is not able to finish it
 all that behold it begin to mock him
","Saying
 This man began to build
 and was not able to finish.","Or what king
 going to make war against another king
 sitteth not down first
 and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand?","Or else
 while the other is yet a great way off
 he sendeth an ambassage
 and desireth conditions of peace.","So likewise
 whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath
 he cannot be my disciple.","Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his savour
 wherewith shall it be seasoned?","It is neither fit for the land
 nor yet for the dunghill; but men cast it out. He that hath ears to hear
 let him hear.","What man of you
 having an hundred sheep
 if he lose one of them
 doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness
 and go after that which is lost
 until he find it?","And when he hath found it
 he layeth it on his shoulders
 rejoicing.","And when he cometh home
 he calleth together his friends and neighbours
 saying unto them
 Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost.","I say unto you
 that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth
 more than over ninety and nine just persons
 which need no repentance.","Either what woman having ten pieces of silver
 if she lose one piece
 doth not light a candle
 and sweep the house
 and seek diligently till she find it?","And when she hath found it
 she calleth her friends and her neighbours together
 saying
 Rejoice with me; for I have found the piece which I had lost.","Likewise
 I say unto you
 there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.","And he said
 A certain man had two sons:","And the younger of them said to his father
 Father
 give me the portion of goods that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his living.","And not many days after the younger son gathered all together
 and took his journey into a far country
 and there wasted his substance with riotous living.","And when he had spent all
 there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want.","And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.","And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.","And when he came to himself
 he said
 How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare
 and I perish with hunger!","I will arise and go to my father
 and will say unto him
 Father
 I have sinned against heaven
 and before thee
","And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.","And he arose
 and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off
 his father saw him
 and had compassion
 and ran
 and fell on his neck
 and kissed him.","And the son said unto him
 Father
 I have sinned against heaven
 and in thy sight
 and am no more worthy to be called thy son.","But the father said to his servants
 Bring forth the best robe
 and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand
 and shoes on his feet:","And bring hither the fatted calf
 and kill it; and let us eat
 and be merry:","For this my son was dead
 and is alive again; he was lost
 and is found. And they began to be merry.","Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house
 he heard musick and dancing.","And he called one of the servants
 and asked what these things meant.","And he said unto him
 Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf
 because he hath received him safe and sound.","And he was angry
 and would not go in: therefore came his father out
 and intreated him.","And he answering said to his father
 Lo
 these many years do I serve thee
 neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid
 that I might make merry with my friends:","But as soon as this thy son was come
 which hath devoured thy living with harlots
 thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.","And he said unto him
 Son
 thou art ever with me
 and all that I have is thine.","It was meet that we should make merry
 and be glad: for this thy brother was dead
 and is alive again; and was lost
 and is found.","And he said also unto his disciples
 There was a certain rich man
 which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods.","And he called him
 and said unto him
 How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward.","Then the steward said within himself
 What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed.","I am resolved what to do
 that
 when I am put out of the stewardship
 they may receive me into their houses.","So he called every one of his lord's debtors unto him
 and said unto the first
 How much owest thou unto my lord?","And he said
 An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him
 Take thy bill
 and sit down quickly
 and write fifty.","Then said he to another
 And how much owest thou? And he said
 An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him
 Take thy bill
 and write fourscore.","And the lord commended the unjust steward
 because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.","And I say unto you
 Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that
 when ye fail
 they may receive you into everlasting habitations.","He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.","If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon
 who will commit to your trust the true riches?","And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's
 who shall give you that which is your own?","No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one
 and love the other; or else he will hold to the one
 and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.","And he said unto them
 Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.","The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached
 and every man presseth into it.","And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass
 than one tittle of the law to fail.","Whosoever putteth away his wife
 and marrieth another
 committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth adultery.","There was a certain rich man
 which was clothed in purple and fine linen
 and fared sumptuously every day:","And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus
 which was laid at his gate
 full of sores
","And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.","And it came to pass
 that the beggar died
 and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died
 and was buried;","And in hell he lift up his eyes
 being in torments
 and seeth Abraham afar off
 and Lazarus in his bosom.","And he cried and said
 Father Abraham
 have mercy on me
 and send Lazarus
 that he may dip the tip of his finger in water
 and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.","But Abraham said
 Son
 remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things
 and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted
 and thou art tormented.","And beside all this
 between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us
 that would come from thence.","Then he said
 I pray thee therefore
 father
 that thou wouldest send him to my father's house:","For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them
 lest they also come into this place of torment.","Abraham saith unto him
 They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.","And he said
 Nay
 father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead
 they will repent.","And he said unto him
 If they hear not Moses and the prophets
 neither will they be persuaded
 though one rose from the dead.","Then said he unto the disciples
 It is impossible but that offences will come: but woe unto him
 through whom they come!","It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck
 and he cast into the sea
 than that he should offend one of these little ones.","Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee
 rebuke him; and if he repent
 forgive him.","And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day
 and seven times in a day turn again to thee
 saying
 I repent; thou shalt forgive him.","And the Lord said
 If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed
 ye might say unto this sycamine tree
 Be thou plucked up by the root
 and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you.","But which of you
 having a servant plowing or feeding cattle
 will say unto him by and by
 when he is come from the field
 Go and sit down to meat?","And will not rather say unto him
 Make ready wherewith I may sup
 and gird thyself
 and serve me
 till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?","Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not.","So likewise ye
 when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you
 say
 We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do.","And it came to pass
 as he went to Jerusalem
 that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.","And when he saw them
 he said unto them
 Go shew yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass
 that
 as they went
 they were cleansed.","And Jesus answering said
 Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine?","There are not found that returned to give glory to God
 save this stranger.","And he said unto him
 Arise
 go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole.","And when he was demanded of the Pharisees
 when the kingdom of God should come
 he answered them and said
 The kingdom of God cometh not with observation:","Neither shall they say
 Lo here! or
 lo there! for
 behold
 the kingdom of God is within you.","And he said unto the disciples
 The days will come
 when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man
 and ye shall not see it.","And they shall say to you
 See here; or
 see there: go not after them
 nor follow them.","For as the lightning
 that lighteneth out of the one part under heaven
 shineth unto the other part under heaven; so shall also the Son of man be in his day.","But first must he suffer many things
 and be rejected of this generation.","And as it was in the days of Noe
 so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.","They did eat
 they drank
 they married wives
 they were given in marriage
 until the day that Noah entered into the ark
 and the flood came
 and destroyed them all.","Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat
 they drank
 they bought
 they sold
 they planted
 they builded;","But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven
 and destroyed them all.","Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.","In that day
 he which shall be upon the housetop
 and his stuff in the house
 let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field
 let him likewise not return back.","Remember Lot's wife.","Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.","I tell you
 in that night there shall be two men in one bed; the one shall be taken
 and the other shall be left.","Two women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken
 and the other left.","And they answered and said unto him
 Where
 Lord? And he said unto them
 Wheresoever the body is
 thither will the eagles be gathered together.","Saying
 There was in a city a judge
 which feared not God
 neither regarded man:","And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him
 saying
 Avenge me of mine adversary.","And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself
 Though I fear not God
 nor regard man;","Yet because this widow troubleth me
 I will avenge her
 lest by her continual coming she weary me.","And the Lord said
 Hear what the unjust judge saith.","And shall not God avenge his own elect
 which cry day and night unto him
 though he bear long with them?","I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh
 shall he find faith on the earth?","Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee
 and the other a publican.","The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself
 God
 I thank thee
 that I am not as other men are
 extortioners
 unjust
 adulterers
 or even as this publican.","I fast twice in the week
 I give tithes of all that I possess.","And the publican
 standing afar off
 would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven
 but smote upon his breast
 saying
 God be merciful to me a sinner.","I tell you
 this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.","But Jesus called them unto him
 and said
 Suffer little children to come unto me
 and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.","Verily I say unto you
 Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.","And Jesus said unto him
 Why callest thou me good? none is good
 save one
 that is
 God.","Thou knowest the commandments
 Do not commit adultery
 Do not kill
 Do not steal
 Do not bear false witness
 Honour thy father and thy mother.","And he said
 All these have I kept from my youth up.","Now when Jesus heard these things
 he said unto him
 Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast
 and distribute unto the poor
 and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come
 follow me.","And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful
 he said
 How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!","For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye
 than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.","And he said
 The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.","And he said unto them
 Verily I say unto you
 There is no man that hath left house
 or parents
 or brethren
 or wife
 or children
 for the kingdom of God's sake
","Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time
 and in the world to come life everlasting.","Then he took unto him the twelve
 and said unto them
 Behold
 we go up to Jerusalem
 and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.","For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles
 and shall be mocked
 and spitefully entreated
 and spitted on:","And they shall scourge him
 and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise again.","And they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them
 neither knew they the things which were spoken.","Saying
 What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And he said
 Lord
 that I may receive my sight.","And Jesus said unto him
 Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee.","And when Jesus came to the place
 he looked up
 and saw him
 and said unto him
 Zacchaeus
 make haste
 and come down; for to day I must abide at thy house.","And Zacchaeus stood
 and said unto the Lord: Behold
 Lord
 the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation
 I restore him fourfold.","And Jesus said unto him
 This day is salvation come to this house
 forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham.","For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.","He said therefore
 A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom
 and to return.","And he called his ten servants
 and delivered them ten pounds
 and said unto them
 Occupy till I come.","But his citizens hated him
 and sent a message after him
 saying
 We will not have this man to reign over us.","And it came to pass
 that when he was returned
 having received the kingdom
 then he commanded these servants to be called unto him
 to whom he had given the money
 that he might know how much every man had gained by trading.","Then came the first
 saying
 Lord
 thy pound hath gained ten pounds.","And he said unto him
 Well
 thou good servant: because thou hast been faithful in a very little
 have thou authority over ten cities.","And the second came
 saying
 Lord
 thy pound hath gained five pounds.","And he said likewise to him
 Be thou also over five cities.","And another came
 saying
 Lord
 behold
 here is thy pound
 which I have kept laid up in a napkin:","For I feared thee
 because thou art an austere man: thou takest up that thou layedst not down
 and reapest that thou didst not sow.","And he saith unto him
 Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee
 thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere man
 taking up that I laid not down
 and reaping that I did not sow:","Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank
 that at my coming I might have required mine own with usury?","And he said unto them that stood by
 Take from him the pound
 and give it to him that hath ten pounds.","(And they said unto him
 Lord
 he hath ten pounds.)","For I say unto you
 That unto every one which hath shall be given; and from him that hath not
 even that he hath shall be taken away from him.","But those mine enemies
 which would not that I should reign over them
 bring hither
 and slay them before me.","Saying
 Go ye into the village over against you; in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied
 whereon yet never man sat: loose him
 and bring him hither.","And if any man ask you
 Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say unto him
 Because the Lord hath need of him.","And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him
 Master
 rebuke thy disciples.","And he answered and said unto them
 I tell you that
 if these should hold their peace
 the stones would immediately cry out.","Saying
 If thou hadst known
 even thou
 at least in this thy day
 the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.","For the days shall come upon thee
 that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee
 and compass thee round
 and keep thee in on every side
","And shall lay thee even with the ground
 and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.","Saying unto them
 It is written
 My house is the house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of thieves.","And he answered and said unto them
 I will also ask you one thing; and answer me:","The baptism of John
 was it from heaven
 or of men?","And Jesus said unto them
 Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.","Then began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain man planted a vineyard
 and let it forth to husbandmen
 and went into a far country for a long time.","And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen
 that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat him
 and sent him away empty.","And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also
 and entreated him shamefully
 and sent him away empty.","And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also
 and cast him out.","Then said the lord of the vineyard
 What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: it may be they will reverence him when they see him.","But when the husbandmen saw him
 they reasoned among themselves
 saying
 This is the heir: come
 let us kill him
 that the inheritance may be ours.","So they cast him out of the vineyard
 and killed him. What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them?","He shall come and destroy these husbandmen
 and shall give the vineyard to others. And when they heard it
 they said
 God forbid.","And he beheld them
 and said
 What is this then that is written
 The stone which the builders rejected
 the same is become the head of the corner?","Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall
 it will grind him to powder.","And they watched him
 and sent forth spies
 which should feign themselves just men
 that they might take hold of his words
 that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor.","Shew me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it? They answered and said
 Caesar's.","And he said unto them
 Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's
 and unto God the things which be God's.","And they could not take hold of his words before the people: and they marvelled at his answer
 and held their peace.","And Jesus answering said unto them
 The children of this world marry
 and are given in marriage:","But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world
 and the resurrection from the dead
 neither marry
 nor are given in marriage:","Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God
 being the children of the resurrection.","Now that the dead are raised
 even Moses shewed at the bush
 when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham
 and the God of Isaac
 and the God of Jacob.","For he is not a God of the dead
 but of the living: for all live unto him.","And he said unto them
 How say they that Christ is David's son?","And David himself saith in the book of Psalms
 The Lord said unto my Lord
 Sit thou on my right hand
","Till I make thine enemies thy footstool.","David therefore calleth him Lord
 how is he then his son?","Beware of the scribes
 which desire to walk in long robes
 and love greetings in the markets
 and the highest seats in the synagogues
 and the chief rooms at feasts;","Which devour widows' houses
 and for a shew make long prayers: the same shall receive greater damnation.","And he said
 Of a truth I say unto you
 that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all:","For all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of God: but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had.","As for these things which ye behold
 the days will come
 in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another
 that shall not be thrown down.","And he said
 Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall come in my name
 saying
 I am Christ; and the time draweth near: go ye not therefore after them.","But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions
 be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the end is not by and by.","Then said he unto them
 Nation shall rise against nation
 and kingdom against kingdom:","And great earthquakes shall be in divers places
 and famines
 and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven.","But before all these
 they shall lay their hands on you
 and persecute you
 delivering you up to the synagogues
 and into prisons
 being brought before kings and rulers for my name's sake.","And it shall turn to you for a testimony.","Settle it therefore in your hearts
 not to meditate before what ye shall answer:","For I will give you a mouth and wisdom
 which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist.","And ye shall be betrayed both by parents
 and brethren
 and kinsfolks
 and friends; and some of you shall they cause to be put to death.","And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake.","But there shall not an hair of your head perish.","In your patience possess ye your souls.","And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies
 then know that the desolation thereof is nigh.","Then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains; and let them which are in the midst of it depart out; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto.","For these be the days of vengeance
 that all things which are written may be fulfilled.","But woe unto them that are with child
 and to them that give suck
 in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land
 and wrath upon this people.","And they shall fall by the edge of the sword
 and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles
 until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.","And there shall be signs in the sun
 and in the moon
 and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations
 with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;","Men's hearts failing them for fear
 and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.","And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.","And when these things begin to come to pass
 then look up
 and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.","And he spake to them a parable; Behold the fig tree
 and all the trees;","When they now shoot forth
 ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand.","So likewise ye
 when ye see these things come to pass
 know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand.","Verily I say unto you
 This generation shall not pass away
 till all be fulfilled.","Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.","And take heed to yourselves
 lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting
 and drunkenness
 and cares of this life
 and so that day come upon you unawares.","For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth.","Watch ye therefore
 and pray always
 that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass
 and to stand before the Son of man.","And he sent Peter and John
 saying
 Go and prepare us the passover
 that we may eat.","And he said unto them
 Behold
 when ye are entered into the city
 there shall a man meet you
 bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he entereth in.","And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house
 The Master saith unto thee
 Where is the guestchamber
 where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?","And he shall shew you a large upper room furnished: there make ready.","And he said unto them
 With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer:","For I say unto you
 I will not any more eat thereof
 until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.","And he took the cup
 and gave thanks
 and said
 Take this
 and divide it among yourselves:","For I say unto you
 I will not drink of the fruit of the vine
 until the kingdom of God shall come.","And he took bread
 and gave thanks
 and brake it
 and gave unto them
 saying
 This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.","Likewise also the cup after supper
 saying
 This cup is the new testament in my blood
 which is shed for you.","But
 behold
 the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table.","And truly the Son of man goeth
 as it was determined: but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed!","And he said unto them
 The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors.","But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you
 let him be as the younger; and he that is chief
 as he that doth serve.","For whether is greater
 he that sitteth at meat
 or he that serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as he that serveth.","Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations.","And I appoint unto you a kingdom
 as my Father hath appointed unto me;","That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom
 and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.","And the Lord said
 Simon
 Simon
 behold
 Satan hath desired to have you
 that he may sift you as wheat:","But I have prayed for thee
 that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted
 strengthen thy brethren.","And he said unto him
 Lord
 I am ready to go with thee
 both into prison
 and to death.","And he said
 I tell thee
 Peter
 the cock shall not crow this day
 before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.","And he said unto them
 When I sent you without purse
 and scrip
 and shoes
 lacked ye any thing? And they said
 Nothing.","Then said he unto them
 But now
 he that hath a purse
 let him take it
 and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no sword
 let him sell his garment
 and buy one.","For I say unto you
 that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me
 And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end.","And they said
 Lord
 behold
 here are two swords. And he said unto them
 It is enough.","And when he was at the place
 he said unto them
 Pray that ye enter not into temptation.","Saying
 Father
 if thou be willing
 remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will
 but thine
 be done.","And said unto them
 Why sleep ye? rise and pray
 lest ye enter into temptation.","But Jesus said unto him
 Judas
 betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?","And Jesus answered and said
 Suffer ye thus far. And he touched his ear
 and healed him.","Then Jesus said unto the chief priests
 and captains of the temple
 and the elders
 which were come to him
 Be ye come out
 as against a thief
 with swords and staves?","When I was daily with you in the temple
 ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour
 and the power of darkness.","And the Lord turned
 and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord
 how he had said unto him
 Before the cock crow
 thou shalt deny me thrice.","Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them
 If I tell you
 ye will not believe:","And if I also ask you
 ye will not answer me
 nor let me go.","Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God.","Then said they all
 Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them
 Ye say that I am.","And Pilate asked him
 saying
 Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said
 Thou sayest it.","When Pilate heard of Galilee
 he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.","Said unto them
 Ye have brought this man unto me
 as one that perverteth the people: and
 behold
 I
 having examined him before you
 have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:","And he said unto them the third time
 Why
 what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him
 and let him go.","But Jesus turning unto them said
 Daughters of Jerusalem
 weep not for me
 but weep for yourselves
 and for your children.","For
 behold
 the days are coming
 in the which they shall say
 Blessed are the barren
 and the wombs that never bare
 and the paps which never gave suck.","Then shall they begin to say to the mountains
 Fall on us; and to the hills
 Cover us.","For if they do these things in a green tree
 what shall be done in the dry?","Then said Jesus
 Father
 forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment
 and cast lots.","And Jesus said unto him
 Verily I say unto thee
 Today shalt thou be with me in paradise.","And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice
 he said
 Father
 into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus
 he gave up the ghost.","And as they were afraid
 and bowed down their faces to the earth
 they said unto them
 Why seek ye the living among the dead?","And he said unto them
 What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another
 as ye walk
 and are sad?","And he said unto them
 What things? And they said unto him
 Concerning Jesus of Nazareth
 which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:","Then he said unto them
 O fools
 and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:","Ought not Christ to have suffered these things
 and to enter into his glory?","And as they thus spake
 Jesus himself stood in the midst of them
 and saith unto them
 Peace be unto you.","And he said unto them
 Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?","Behold my hands and my feet
 that it is I myself: handle me
 and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones
 as ye see me have.","And while they yet believed not for joy
 and wondered
 he said unto them
 Have ye here any meat?","And he said unto them
 These are the words which I spake unto you
 while I was yet with you
 that all things must be fulfilled
 which were written in the law of Moses
 and in the prophets
 and in the psalms
 concerning me.","And said unto them
 Thus it is written
 and thus it behooved Christ to suffer
 and to rise from the dead the third day:","And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations
 beginning at Jerusalem.","And ye are witnesses of these things.","And
 behold
 I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem
 until ye be endued with power from on high.","And he said to them
 \u201cWhy were you searching for me? Did you not know that it was necessary for me to be in the house of my Father?\u201d ","And Jesus replied to him
 \u201cIt is written
 \u2018Man will not live on bread alone.\u2019\u201d","And the devil said to him
 \u201cI will give you all this domain and their glory
 because it has been handed over to me
 and I can give it to whomever I want. ","And Jesus answered and said to him
 \u201cIt is written
 \u2018You shall worship the Lord your God
 and serve only him.\u2019\u201d","And he brought him to Jerusalem
 and had him stand on the highest point of the temple and said to him
 \u201cIf you are the Son of God
 throw yourself down from here
 ","And Jesus answered and said to him
 \u201cIt is said
 \u2018You are not to put to the test the Lord your God.\u2019\u201d ","\u201cThe Spirit of the Lord is upon me
 because of which he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives
 and recovery of sight to the blind
 to send out in freedom those who are oppressed
","to proclaim the favorable year of the Lord.\u201d","And he began to say to them
 \u201cToday this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cDoubtless you will tell me this parable: \u2018Physician
 heal yourself!\u2019 Whatever we have heard that took place in Capernaum
 do here in your hometown also!\u201d ","And he said
 \u201cTruly I say to you that no prophet is acceptable in his own hometown. ","But in truth I say to you
 there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah
 when the sky was shut for three years and six months while a great famine took place over all the land. ","And Elijah was sent to none of them
 but only to Zarephath in the region of Sidon
 to a woman who was a widow. ","And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha
 and none of them was made clean except Naaman the Syrian.\u201d ","And they were astounded at his teaching
 because he spoke with authority.","And Jesus rebuked him
 saying
 \u201cBe silent and come out of him!\u201d And after throwing him down in their midst
 the demon came out of him without hurting him at all. ","And demons also were coming out of many
 crying out and saying
 \u201cYou are the Son of God!\u201d And he rebuked them and did not permit them to speak
 because they knew that he was the Christ.","But he said to them
 \u201cIt is necessary for me to proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns also
 because I was sent for this purpose. ","And when he stopped speaking
 he said to Simon
 \u201cPut out into the deep water and let down your nets for a catch.\u201d ","and so also were James and John
 the sons of Zebedee
 who were business partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon
 \u201cDo not be afraid! From now on you will be catching people!\u201d ","And extending his hand he touched him
 saying
 \u201cI am willing; be clean.\u201d And immediately the leprosy went away from him. ","And he ordered him
 \u201cTell no one
 but go and show yourself to the priest and bring the offering for your cleansing just as Moses commanded
 for a testimony to them. ","And when he saw their faith
 he said
 \u201cFriend
 your sins are forgiven you.\u201d ","But Jesus
 perceiving their thoughts
 answered and said to them
 \u201cWhy are you reasoning in your hearts? ","Which is easier to say
 \u2018Your sins are forgiven you
\u2019 or to say
 \u2018Get up and walk?\u2019 ","But in order that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins
\u201d he said to the one who was paralyzed
 \u201cI say to you
 \u2018Get up and pick up your stretcher and go to your home.\u2019\u201d ","And after these things
 he went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax booth
 and he said to him
 \u201cFollow me!\u201d ","And Jesus answered and said to them
 \u201cThose who are healthy do not have need of a physician
 but those who are sick. ","I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.\u201d","And they said to him
 \u201cThe disciples of John fast often and make prayers\u2014likewise also the disciples of the Pharisees\u2014but yours are eating and drinking!\u201d ","So he said to them
 \u201cYou are not able to make the bridegroom\u2019s attendants fast as long as the bridegroom is with them
 are you? ","But days will come
 and when the bridegroom is taken away from them
 then they will fast in those days.\u201d ","And he also told a parable to them: \u201cNo one tears a patch from a new garment and puts it on an old garment. Otherwise
 he will have torn the new also
 and the old will not match the patch that is from the new. ","And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise
 the new wine will burst the wineskins
 and it will be spilled and the wineskins will be destroyed. ","But new wine must be put into new wineskins.","And no one after drinking old wine wants new
 because he says
 \u2018The old is just fine!\u2019\u201d","And Jesus answered and said to them
 \u201cHave you not read this
 what David did when he and those who were with him were hungry\u2014","how he entered into the house of God and took the bread of the presentation
 which it is not permitted to eat (except the priests alone)
 and ate it and gave it to those with him?\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cThe Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.\u201d","But he knew their thoughts and said to the man who had the withered hand
 \u201cGet up and stand in the middle
\u201d and he got up and stood there. ","And Jesus said to them
 \u201cI ask you whether it is permitted on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil
 to save a life or to destroy it?\u201d ","And after looking around at them all
 he said to him
 \u201cStretch out your hand
\u201d and he did
 and his hand was restored. ","Blessed are those who are hungry now
 because you will be satisfied. Blessed are those who weep now
 Because you will laugh.","Blessed are you when people hate you
 and when they exclude you and revile you and spurn your name as evil on account of the Son of Man. ","Rejoice in that day
 and leap for joy
 for behold
 your reward is great in heaven. For their fathers used to do the same things to the prophets.","\u201cBut woe to you who are rich
 because you have received your comfort.","Woe to you who are satisfied now
 because you will be hungry. Woe
 you who laugh now
 because you will mourn and weep.","Woe whenever all people speak well of you
 for their fathers used to do the same things to the false prophets.","\u201cBut to you who are listening I say: Love your enemies
 do good to those who hate you
 ","bless those who curse you
 pray for those who mistreat you. ","To the one who strikes you on the cheek
 offer the other also
 and from the one who takes away your cloak
 do not withhold your tunic also. ","Give to everyone who asks you
 and from the one who takes away your things
 do not ask for them back. ","And just as you want people to do to you
 do the same to them.","\u201cAnd if you love those who love you
 what kind of credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them! ","And if you do good to those who do good to you
 what kind of credit is that to you? Even the sinners do the same! ","And if you lend to those from whom you expect to receive back
 what kind of credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners
 so that they may get back an equal amount! ","But love your enemies
 and do good
 and lend expecting back nothing
 and your reward will be great
 and you will be sons of the Most High
 because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked. ","Be merciful
 just as your Father is merciful!","\u201cAnd do not judge
 and you will never be judged. And do not condemn
 and you will never be condemned. Pardon
 and you will be pardoned. ","Give
 and it will be given to you
 a good measure\u2014pressed down
 shaken
 overflowing\u2014they will pour out into your lap. For with the measure by which you measure out
 it will be measured out to you in return.\u201d","And he also told them a parable: \u201cSurely a blind person cannot lead the blind
 can he? Will they not both fall into a pit? ","A disciple is not superior to his teacher
 but everyone
 when he is fully trained
 will be like his teacher. ","And why do you see the speck that is in your brother\u2019s eye
 but do not notice the beam of wood that is in your own eye? ","How are you able to say to your brother
 \u201cBrother
 allow me to remove the speck that is in your eye
\u201d while you yourself do not see the beam of wood in your own eye? Hypocrite! First remove the beam of wood from your own eye
 and then you will see clearly to remove the speck that is in your brother\u2019s eye!","\u201cFor there is no good tree that produces bad fruit
 nor on the other hand a bad tree that produces good fruit
 ","for each tree is known by its own fruit. For figs are not gathered from thorn plants
 nor are grapes harvested from thorn bushes. ","The good person out of the good treasury of his heart brings forth good
 and the evil person out of his evil treasury brings forth evil. For out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.","\u201cAnd why do you call me \u2018Lord
 Lord
\u2019 and do not do what I tell you?","\u201cEveryone who comes to me and listens to my words and does them\u2014I will show you what he is like:","he is like a man building a house
 who dug and went down deep and laid the foundation on the rock. And when a flood came
 the river burst against that house and was not able to shake it
 because it had been built well. ","But the one who hears my words and does not do them is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation
 which the river burst against
 and immediately it collapsed\u2014and the collapse of that house was great!\u201d","And when Jesus heard these things
 he marveled at him
 and turning around to the crowd that was following him
 he said
 \u201cI tell you
 not even in Israel have I found such great faith!\u201d ","And when the Lord saw her
 he had compassion for her and said to her
 \u201cDo not weep!\u201d ","And he came up and touched the bier
 and those who were carrying it stopped. And he said
 \u201cYoung man
 I say to you
 get up!\u201d ","And he answered and said to them
 \u201cGo and tell John what you have seen and heard: the blind receive sight
 the lame walk
 lepers are cleansed
 the deaf hear; the dead are raised
 the poor have good news announced to them. ","And whoever is not offended by me is blessed.\u201d","And when the messengers of John had departed
 he began to speak to the crowds concerning John: \u201cWhat did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? ","But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Behold
 those who are in splendid clothing and luxury are in the royal palaces. ","But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes
 I tell you
 and even more than a prophet! ","It is this man about whom it is written: \u2018Behold
 I am sending my messenger before your face
 who will prepare your way before you.\u2019","I tell you
 there is no one greater among those born of women than John
 but the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he. ","\u201cTo what then shall I compare the people of this generation
 and what are they like? ","They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling out to one another
 who say
 \u2018We played the flute for you and you did not dance; we sang a lament and you did not weep.\u2019","For John the Baptist has come not eating bread or drinking wine
 and you say
 \u2018He has a demon!\u2019 ","The Son of Man has come eating and drinking
 and you say
 \u2018Behold
 a man who is a glutton and a drunkard
 a friend of tax collectors and sinners!\u2019 ","And wisdom is vindicated by all her children.\u201d","Now when the Pharisee who invited him saw this
 he spoke to himself
 saying
 \u201cIf this man were a prophet
 he would have known who and what kind of woman this is who is touching him
 that she is a sinner.\u201d ","And Jesus answered and said to him
 \u201cSimon
 I have something to say to you.\u201d And he said
 \u201cTeacher
 say it.\u201d ","\u201cThere were two debtors who owed a certain creditor. One owed five hundred denarii and the other fifty.","When they were not able to repay him
 he forgave the debts of both. Now which of them will love him more?\u201d ","Simon answered and said
 \u201cI suppose that it is the one to whom he forgave more.\u201d And he said to him
 \u201cYou have judged correctly.\u201d ","And turning toward the woman
 he said to Simon
 \u201cDo you see this woman? I entered into your house. You did not give me water for my feet
 but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. ","You did not give me a kiss
 but from the time I entered
 she has not stopped kissing my feet. ","You did not anoint my head with olive oil
 but she anointed my feet with perfumed oil. ","For this reason I tell you
 her sins\u2014which were many\u2014have been forgiven
 for she loved much. But the one to whom little is forgiven loves little.\u201d ","And he said to her
 \u201cYour sins are forgiven.\u201d ","And he said to the woman
 \u201cYour faith has saved you. Go in peace.\u201d","And while a large crowd was gathering and they were going to him from town after town
 he spoke by means of a parable: ","\u201cThe sower went out to sow his seed
 and while he was sowing
 some seed fell on the side of the path and was trampled under foot
 and the birds of the sky devoured it. ","And other seed fell on the rock
 and when it came up
 it withered
 because it did not have moisture. ","And other seed fell in the midst of the thorn plants
 and the thorn plants grew up with it and choked it. ","And other seed fell on the good soil
 and when it came up
 it produced a hundred times as much grain.\u201d As he said these things
 he called out
 \u201cThe one who has ears to hear
 let him hear!\u201d","And he said
 \u201cTo you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God
 but to the rest they are in parables
 so that \u2018Seeing they may not see
 and hearing they may not understand.\u2019","Now the parable means this: the seed is the word of God
 ","and those beside the path are the ones who have heard. Then the devil comes and takes away the word from their heart
 so that they may not believe and be saved. ","And those on the rock are those who receive the word with joy when they hear it
 and these do not have enough root
 who believe for a time and in a time of testing fall away. ","And the seed that fell into the thorn plants\u2014these are the ones who hear and as they go along are choked by the worries and riches and pleasures of life
 and they do not bear fruit to maturity. ","But the seed on the good soil\u2014these are the ones who
 after hearing the word
 hold fast to it with a noble and good heart
 and bear fruit with patient endurance.","\u201cAnd no one
 after lighting a lamp
 covers it with a jar or puts it under a bed
 but puts it on a lampstand
 so that those who come in can see the light. ","For nothing is secret that will not become evident
 and nothing hidden that will never be known and come to light. ","Therefore consider how you listen
 for whoever has
 to him more will be given
 and whoever does not have
 even what he thinks that he has will be taken away from him.\u201d","And it was reported to him
 \u201cYour mother and your brothers are standing outside wanting to see you.\u201d ","But he answered and said to them
 \u201cThese are my mother and my brothers\u2014the ones who hear the word of God and do it.","Now it happened that on one of the days both he and his disciples got into a boat
 and he said to them
 \u201cLet us cross over to the other side of the lake.\u201d And they set sail
 ","And he said to them
 \u201cWhere is your faith?\u201d But they were afraid and were astonished
 saying to one another
 \u201cWho then is this
 that he commands even the winds and the water and they obey him?\u201d","So Jesus asked him
 \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d And he said
 \u201cLegion
\u201d because many demons had entered into him. ","\u201cReturn to your home and tell all that God has done for you.\u201d And he went away
 proclaiming throughout the whole town all that Jesus had done for him.","And Jesus said
 \u201cWho is the one who touched me?\u201d And when they all denied it
 Peter said
 \u201cMaster
 the crowds are pressing you hard and crowding you!\u201d ","But Jesus said
 \u201cSomeone touched me
 because I know power has gone out from me.\u201d ","And he said to her
 \u201cDaughter
 your faith has saved you. Go in peace.\u201d","But Jesus
 when he heard this
 replied to him
 \u201cDo not be afraid! Only believe
 and she will be healed.\u201d ","And they were all weeping and mourning for her
 but he said
 \u201cDo not weep! For she is not dead
 but is sleeping.\u201d ","But he took her hand and called
 saying
 \u201cChild
 get up.\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cTake along nothing for the journey\u2014neither a staff
 nor a traveler\u2019s bag
 nor bread
 nor money
 nor to have two tunics apiece. ","And into whatever house you enter
 stay there and depart from there. ","And as for all those who do not welcome you\u2014when you depart from that town
 shake off the dust from your feet for a testimony against them.\u201d ","But he said to them
 \u201cYou give them something to eat!\u201d And they said
 \u201cWe have no more than five loaves and two fish
 unless perhaps we go and purchase food for all these people.\u201d ","(For there were about five thousand men.) So he said to his disciples
 \u201cHave them sit down in groups of about fifty each.\u201d ","And it happened that while he was praying alone
 the disciples were with him. And he asked them
 saying
 \u201cWho do the crowds say that I am?\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cBut who do you say that I am?\u201d And Peter answered and said
 \u201cThe Christ of God.\u201d","saying
 \u201cIt is necessary for the Son of Man to suffer many things and to be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes
 and to be killed
 and to be raised on the third day.","And he said to them all
 \u201cIf anyone wants to come after me
 he must deny himself and take up his cross every day and follow me. ","For whoever wants to save his life will lose it
 but whoever loses his life on account of me
 this person will save it. ","For what is a person benefited if he gains the whole world but loses or forfeits himself?","For whoever is ashamed of me and my words
 the Son of Man will be ashamed of this person when he comes in his glory and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels. ","But I tell you truly
 there are some of those standing here who will never experience death until they see the kingdom of God.\u201d","And it happened that as they were going away from him
 Peter said to Jesus
 \u201cMaster
 it is good for us to be here. And let us make three shelters
 one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah
\u201d not knowing what he was saying. ","So Jesus answered and said
 \u201cO unbelieving and perverted generation! How long will I be with you and put up with you? Bring your son here!\u201d ","\u201cYou take these words to heart
 for the Son of Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men.\u201d ","and said to them
 \u201cWhoever welcomes this child in my name welcomes me
 and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me. For the one who is least among you all\u2014this one is great.\u201d","But Jesus said to him
 \u201cDo not prevent him
 because whoever is not against you is for you.\u201d","And Jesus said to him
 \u201cFoxes have dens and birds of the sky have nests
 but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.\u201d ","And he said to another
 \u201cFollow me!\u201d But he said
 \u201cLord
 first allow me to go and bury my father.\u201d ","But he said to him
 \u201cLeave the dead to bury their own dead! But you go and proclaim the kingdom of God.\u201d ","But Jesus said
 \u201cNo one who puts his hand on the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God!\u201d","And he said to them
 \u201cThe harvest is plentiful
 but the workers are few. Therefore ask the Lord of the harvest that he send out workers into his harvest. ","Go! Behold
 I am sending you out like lambs in the midst of wolves! ","Do not carry a money bag or a traveler\u2019s bag or sandals
 and greet no one along the road. ","And into whatever house you enter
 first say
 \u201cPeace be to this household!\u201d ","And if a son of peace is there
 your peace will rest on him. But if not
 it will return to you. ","And remain in the same house
 eating and drinking whatever they provide
 for the worker is worthy of his pay. Do not move from house to house. ","And into whatever town you enter and they welcome you
 eat whatever is set before you
 ","and heal the sick in it
 and say to them
 \u201cThe kingdom of God has come near to you.\u201d ","But into whatever town you enter and they do not welcome you
 go out into its streets and say
 ","\u201cEven the dust of your town that clings to our feet we wipe off against you! Nevertheless know this: that the kingdom of God has come near!\u201d","I tell you that it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom than for that town!","Woe to you
 Chorazin! Woe to you
 Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon
 they would have repented long ago
 sitting in sackcloth and ashes! ","But it will be more bearable for Tyre and for Sidon in the judgment than for you!","And you
 Capernaum
 will you be exalted to heaven? No! You will be brought down to Hades! ","The one who listens to you listens to me
 and the one who rejects you rejects me. But the one who rejects me rejects the one who sent me.\u201d","So he said to them
 \u201cI saw Satan falling like lightning from heaven. ","Behold
 I have given you the authority to tread on snakes and scorpions
 and over all the power of the enemy
 and nothing will ever harm you. ","Nevertheless
 do not rejoice in this
 that the spirits are subject to you
 but rejoice that your names are inscribed in heaven.\u201d","At that same time he rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said
 \u201cI praise you
 Father
 Lord of heaven and earth
 that you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to young children. Yes
 Father
 for this was pleasing before you. ","All things have been handed over to me by my Father
 and no one knows who the Son is except the Father and who the Father is except the Son
 and anyone to whom the Son wants to reveal him.\u201d","And turning to the disciples
 he said privately
 \u201cBlessed are the eyes that see the things which you see! ","For I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see the things which you see
 and did not see them
 and to hear the things which you hear
 and did not hear them.\u201d","And behold
 a certain legal expert stood up to test him
 saying
 \u201cTeacher
 what must I do so that I will inherit eternal life?\u201d ","And he said to him
 \u201cWhat is written in the law? How do you read it?\u201d ","And he said to him
 \u201cYou have answered correctly. Do this and you will live.\u201d","And Jesus replied and said
 \u201cA certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho
 and fell into the hands of robbers
 who both stripped him and beat him. After inflicting blows on him
 they went away
 leaving him half dead. ","Now by coincidence a certain priest was going down on that road
 and when he saw him
 he passed by on the opposite side. ","And in the same way also a Levite
 when he came down to the place and saw him
 passed by on the opposite side. ","But a certain Samaritan who was traveling came up to him and
 when he saw him
 had compassion. ","And he came up and bandaged his wounds
 pouring on olive oil and wine
 and he put him on his own animal and brought him to an inn and took care of him. ","And on the next day
 he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper
 and said
 \u201cTake care of him
 and whatever you spend in addition
 I will repay to you when I return. ","Which of these three do you suppose became a neighbor of the man who fell among the robbers?\u201d","So he said
 \u201cThe one who showed mercy to him.\u201d And Jesus said to him
 \u201cYou go and do likewise.\u201d","But the Lord answered and said to her
 \u201cMartha
 Martha
 you are anxious and troubled about many things! ","But few things are necessary
 or only one thing
 for Mary has chosen the better part
 which will not be taken away from her.\u201d","And it happened that while he was in a certain place praying
 when he stopped a certain one of his disciples said to him
 \u201cLord
 teach us to pray
 just as John also taught his disciples.\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cWhen you pray
 say
 \u201cFather
 may your name be treated as holy. May your kingdom come.","Give us each day our daily bread.","And forgive us our sins
 for we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us. And do not lead us into temptation.\u201d","And he said to them
 \u201cWho of you will have a friend
 and will go to him at midnight and say to him
 \u2018Friend
 lend me three loaves
 ","because a friend of mine has come to me on a journey
 and I do not have anything to set before him.\u2019 ","And that one will answer from inside and say
 \u2018Do not cause me trouble! The door has already been shut and my children are with me in bed! I am not able to get up to give you anything.\u2019 ","I tell you
 even if he does not give him anything after he gets up because he is his friend
 at any rate because of his impudence he will get up and give him whatever he needs.","And I tell you
 ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and it will be opened for you. ","For everyone who asks receives
 and the one who seeks finds
 and to the one who knocks it will be opened. ","But what father from among you
 if his son will ask for a fish
 instead of a fish will give him a snake? ","Or also
 if he will ask for an egg
 will give him a scorpion? ","Therefore if you
 although you are evil
 know how to give good gifts to your children
 how much more will the Father from heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?\u201d","And he was expelling a mute demon. Now it happened that when the demon came out
 the man who had been mute spoke
 and the crowds were astonished. ","But he
 knowing their thoughts
 said to them
 \u201cEvery kingdom divided against itself is laid waste
 and a divided household falls. ","So if Satan also is divided against himself
 how will his kingdom stand? For you say that I expel demons by Beelzebul. ","But if I expel demons by Beelzebul
 by whom do your sons expel them? For this reason they will be your judges! ","But if I expel demons by the finger of God
 then the kingdom of God has come upon you! ","When a strong man
 fully armed
 guards his own palace
 his possessions are safe. ","But when a stronger man attacks him and conquers him
 he takes away his full armor in which he trusted and distributes his plunder. ","The one who is not with me is against me
 and the one who does not gather with me scatters.","\u201cWhenever an unclean spirit has gone out of a person
 it travels through waterless places searching for rest
 and does not find it. It says
 \u2018I will return to my house from which I came out.\u2019 ","And when it arrives it finds the house swept and put in order.","Then it goes and brings along seven other spirits more evil than itself
 and they go in and live there. And the last state of that person becomes worse than the first!\u201d","Now it happened that as he said these things
 a certain woman from the crowd raised her voice and said to him
 \u201cBlessed is the womb that bore you
 and the breasts at which you nursed!\u201d ","But he said
 \u201cOn the contrary
 blessed are those who hear the word of God and follow it!\u201d","And as the crowds were increasing
 he began to say
 \u201cThis generation is an evil generation! It demands a sign
 and no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah! ","For just as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites
 so also the Son of Man will be to this generation. ","The queen of the south will rise up at the judgment with the people of this generation and condemn them
 because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon
 and behold
 something greater than Solomon is here! ","The people of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it
 because they repented at the proclamation of Jonah
 and behold
 something greater than Jonah is here!","\u201cNo one after lighting a lamp puts it in a cellar or under a bushel basket
 but on a lampstand
 so that those who come in can see the light. ","Your eye is the lamp of the body. When your eye is sincere
 your whole body is full of light also. But when it is evil
 your body is dark also. ","Therefore pay careful attention that the light in you is not darkness!","If therefore your whole body is full of light
 not having any part dark
 it will be completely full of light
 as when the lamp with its light gives light to you.\u201d","But the Lord said to him
 \u201cNow you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish
 but your inside is full of greediness and wickedness. ","Fools! Did not the one who made the outside make the inside also?","But give as charitable giving the things that are within
 and behold
 everything is clean for you.","\u201cBut woe to you
 Pharisees
 because you pay a tenth of mint and rue and every garden herb
 and neglect justice and love for God! But it was necessary to do these things without neglecting those things also. ","Woe to you
 Pharisees
 because you love the best seat in the synagogues and the greetings in the marketplaces! ","Woe to you
 because you are like unmarked graves
 and the people who walk over them do not know it!","So he said
 \u201cWoe to you also
 legal experts
 because you load people with burdens hard to bear
 and you yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers! ","Woe to you
 because you build the tombs of the prophets
 and your fathers killed them! ","As a result you are witnesses
 and you approve of the deeds of your fathers
 because they killed them and you build their tombs! ","For this reason also the wisdom of God said
 \u2018I will send to them prophets and apostles
 and some of them they will kill and persecute
\u2019 ","so that the blood of all the prophets that has been shed from the foundation of the world may be required of this generation
 ","from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah
 who perished between the altar and the temple building. Yes
 I tell you
 it will be required of this generation! ","Woe to you
 legal experts
 because you have taken away the key to knowledge! You did not enter yourselves
 and you hindered those who were entering!\u201d","During this time when a crowd of many thousands had gathered together
 so that they were trampling one another
 he began to say to his disciples first
 \u201cBeware for yourselves of the leaven of the Pharisees
 which is hypocrisy. ","But nothing is concealed that will not be revealed
 and secret that will not be made known. ","Therefore everything that you have said in the dark will be heard in the light
 and what you have whispered in the inner rooms will be proclaimed on the housetops.","\u201cAnd I tell you
 my friends
 do not be afraid of those who kill the body
 and after these things do not have anything more to do. ","But I will show you whom you should fear: fear the one who has authority
 after the killing
 to throw you into hell! Yes
 I tell you
 fear this one! ","Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? And not one of them is forgotten in the sight of God.","But even the hairs of your head are all numbered! Do not be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.","\u201cAnd I tell you
 everyone who acknowledges me before people
 the Son of Man also will acknowledge him before the angels of God
 ","but the one who denies me before people will be denied before the angels of God.","And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man
 it will be forgiven him
 but to the one who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit
 it will not be forgiven. ","But when they bring you before the synagogues and the rulers and the authorities
 do not be anxious how or what you should speak in your own defense or what you should say
 ","for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that same hour what it is necessary to say.\u201d","But he said to him
 \u201cMan
 who made me a judge or an arbitrator over you?\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cWatch out and guard yourselves from all greediness
 because not even when someone has an abundance does his life consist of his possessions.\u201d ","And he told a parable to them
 saying
 \u201cThe land of a certain rich man yielded an abundant harvest. ","And he reasoned to himself
 saying
 \u2018What should I do? For I do not have anywhere I can gather in my crops.\u2019 ","And he said
 \u2018I will do this: I will tear down my barns and build larger ones
 and I will gather in there all my grain and possessions. ","And I will say to my soul
 \u201cSoul
 you have many possessions stored up for many years. Relax
 eat
 drink
 celebrate!\u201d\u2019 ","But God said to him
 \u2018Fool! This night your life is demanded from you
 and the things which you have prepared\u2014whose will they be?\u2019 ","So is the one who stores up treasure for himself
 and who is not rich toward God!\u201d","And he said to his disciples
 \u201cFor this reason I tell you
 do not be anxious for your life
 what you will eat
 or for your body
 what you will wear. ","For life is more than food
 and the body more than clothing. ","Consider the ravens
 that they neither sow nor reap; to them there is neither storeroom nor barn
 and God feeds them. How much more are you worth than the birds? ","And which of you by being anxious is able to add an hour to his life span?","If then you are not even able to do a very little thing
 why are you anxious about the rest? ","Consider the lilies
 how they grow: they do not toil or spin
 but I say to you
 not even Solomon in all his glory was dressed like one of these. ","But if God clothes the grass in the field in this way
 although it is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven
 how much more will he do so for you
 you of little faith? ","And you
 do not consider what you will eat and what you will drink
 and do not be anxious. ","For all the nations of the world seek after these things
 and your Father knows that you need these things. ","But seek his kingdom and these things will be added to you.","\u201cDo not be afraid
 little flock
 because your Father is well pleased to give you the kingdom. ","Sell your possessions and give charitable gifts. Make for yourselves money bags that do not wear out
 an inexhaustible treasure in heaven where thief does not approach or moth destroy. ","For where your treasure is
 there your heart will be also.","\u201cYou must be prepared for action and your lamps burning.","And you
 be like people who are waiting for their master when he returns from the wedding feast
 so that when he comes back and knocks
 they can open the door for him immediately. ","Blessed are those slaves whom the master will find on the alert when he returns! Truly I say to you that he will dress himself for service and have them recline at the table and will come by and serve them.","Even if he should come back in the second or in the third watch of the night and find them like this
 blessed are they! ","But understand this
 that if the master of the house had known what hour the thief was coming
 he would not have left his house to be broken into. ","You also must be ready
 because the Son of Man is coming at an hour that you do not think he will come.\u201d","And the Lord said
 \u201cWho then is the faithful wise manager whom the master will put in charge over his servants to give them their food allowance at the right time? ","Blessed is that slave whom his master will find so doing when he comes back.","Truly I say to you that he will put him in charge of all his possessions.","But if that slave should say to himself
 \u2018My master is taking a long time to return
\u2019 and he begins to beat the male slaves and the female slaves and to eat and drink and get drunk
 ","the master of that slave will come on a day that he does not expect and at an hour that he does not know
 and will cut him in two and assign his place with the unbelievers. ","And that slave who knew the will of his master and did not prepare or do according to his will will be given a severe beating.","But the one who did not know and did things deserving blows will be given a light beating. And from everyone to whom much has been given
 much will be demanded
 and from him to whom they entrusted much
 they will ask him for even more.","\u201cI have come to bring fire on the earth
 and how I wish that it had been kindled already! ","But I have a baptism to be baptized with
 and how I am distressed until it is accomplished! ","Do you think that I have come to grant peace on the earth? No
 I tell you
 but rather division! ","For from now on there will be five in one household
 divided three against two and two against three. ","They will be divided
 father against son and son against father
 mother against daughter and daughter against mother
 mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.\u201d","And he also said to the crowds
 \u201cWhen you see a cloud coming up in the west
 you say at once
 \u2018A rainstorm is coming
\u2019 and so it happens. ","And when you see the south wind blowing
 you say
 \u2018There will be burning heat
\u2019 and it happens. ","Hypocrites! You know how to evaluate the appearance of the earth and the sky
 but how is it you do not know how to evaluate this present time?","And why do you not also judge for yourselves what is right?","For as you are going with your accuser before the magistrate
 make an effort to come to a settlement with him on the way
 so that he will not drag you to the judge
 and the judge will hand you over to the bailiff
 and the bailiff will throw you into prison. ","I tell you
 you will never get out of there until you have paid back even the last cent!\u201d","And he answered and said to them
 \u201cDo you think that these Galileans were sinners worse than all the Galileans
 because they suffered these things? ","No
 I tell you
 but unless you repent you will all perish as well! ","Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them\u2014do you think that they were sinners worse than all the people who live in Jerusalem?","No
 I tell you
 but unless you repent
 you will all perish as well!\u201d","And he told this parable: \u201cA certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard
 and he came looking for fruit on it and did not find any. ","So he said to the gardener
 \u2018Behold
 for three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree and did not find any. Cut it down! Why should it even exhaust the soil?\u2019 ","But he answered and said to him
 \u2018Sir
 leave it alone this year also
 until I dig around it and put manure on it. ","And if indeed it produces fruit in the coming year
 so much the better
 but if not
 you can cut it down.\u2019\u201d","And when he saw her
 Jesus summoned her and said to her
 \u201cWoman
 you are freed from your disability!\u201d ","But the Lord answered and said to him
 \u201cHypocrites! Does not each one of you untie his ox or his donkey from the feeding trough on the Sabbath and lead it away to water it? ","And this woman
 who is a daughter of Abraham

 \u201cWhat is the kingdom of God like
 and to what shall I compare it? ","It is like a mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his own garden

 and the birds of the sky nested in its branches.\u201d","And again he said
 \u201cTo what shall I compare the kingdom of God? ","It is like yeast that a woman took and hid in three measures of wheat flour until the whole batch was leavened.\u201d","And someone said to him

 are there only a few who are saved?\u201d And he said to them
 ","\u201cMake every effort to enter through the narrow door

 ","when once the master of the house has gotten up and shut the door
 and you begin to stand outside and knock on the door
 saying

 open the door for us!\u2019 And he will answer and say to you
 \u2018I do not know where you are from!\u2019 ","Then you will begin to say
 \u2018We ate and drank in your presence

 saying to you
 \u2018I do not know where you are from! Go away from me

 some are last who will be first

 you will never see me until the time will come when you say

 do not recline at the table in the place of honor

 \u2018Give the place to this person
\u2019 and then with shame you will begin to take the last place. ","But when you are invited
 go and recline at the table in the last place
 so that when the one who invited you comes
 he will say to you
 \u2018Friend

 and the one who humbles himself will be exalted.\u201d","And he also said to the one who had invited him
 \u201cWhen you give a dinner or a banquet

 invite the poor

 the blind
 ","and you will be blessed

 he said to him
 \u201cBlessed is everyone who will eat bread in the kingdom of God!\u201d ","But he said to him
 \u201cA certain man was giving a large banquet and invited many. ","And he sent his slave at the hour of the banquet to say to those who have been invited

 \u2018I have married a wife
 and for this reason I am not able to come.\u2019 ","And the slave came and reported these things to his master. Then the master of the house became angry and said to his slave
 \u2018Go out quickly into the streets and alleys of the city and bring in here the poor and crippled and blind and lame!\u2019 ","And the slave said
 \u2018Sir
 what you ordered has been done
 and there is still room.\u2019 ","And the master said to the slave
 \u2018Go out into the highways and hedges and press them to come in
 so that my house will be filled! ","For I say to you that none of those persons who were invited will taste my banquet!\u2019\u201d","Now large crowds were going along with him
 and he turned around and said to them
 ","\u201cIf anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters
 and furthermore
 even his own life
 he cannot be my disciple. ","Whoever does not carry his own cross and follow me cannot be my disciple.","For which of you
 wanting to build a tower
 does not first sit down and calculate the cost to see if he has enough to complete it? ","Otherwise after he has laid the foundation and is not able to finish it
 all who see it will begin to ridicule him
 ","saying
 \u2018This man began to build and was not able to finish!\u2019 ","Or what king
 going out to engage another king in battle
 does not sit down first and deliberate whether he is able with ten thousand to oppose the one coming against him with twenty thousand. ","But if not
 while the other is still far away
 he sends an ambassador and asks for terms of peace. ","In the same way
 therefore
 every one of you who does not renounce all his own possessions cannot be my disciple.","\u201cNow salt is good
 but if salt becomes tasteless
 with what will it be made salty? ","It is usable neither for the soil nor for the manure pile; they throw it out. The one who has ears to hear
 let him hear!\u201d","\u201cWhat man of you
 having a hundred sheep and losing one of them
 does not leave the ninety-nine in the grassland and go after the one that was lost until he finds it? ","And when he has found it
 he places it on his shoulders
 rejoicing. ","And when he returns to his home
 he calls together his friends and neighbors
 saying to them
 \u2018Rejoice with me
 because I have found my sheep that was lost!\u2019 ","I tell you that in the same way
 there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous people who have no need of repentance.","Or what woman who has ten drachmas
 if she loses one drachma
 does not light a lamp and sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it? ","And when she has found it
 she calls together her friends and neighbors
 saying
 \u2018Rejoice with me
 because I have found the drachma that I had lost!\u2019 ","In the same way
 I tell you
 there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.\u201d","And he said
 \u201cA certain man had two sons. ","And the younger of them said to his father
 \u2018Father
 give me the share of the property that is coming to me.\u2019 So he divided his assets between them. ","And after not many days
 the younger son gathered everything and went on a journey to a distant country
 and there he squandered his wealth by living wastefully. ","And after he had spent everything
 there was a severe famine throughout that country
 and he began to be in need. ","And he went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country
 and he sent him into his fields to tend pigs. ","And he was longing to fill his stomach with the carob pods that the pigs were eating
 and no one was giving anything to him.","\u201cBut when he came to himself
 he said
 \u2018How many of my father\u2019s hired workers have an abundance of food
 and I am dying here from hunger! ","I will set out and go to my father and will say to him
 \u2018Father
 I have sinned against heaven and in your sight! ","I am no longer worthy to be called your son! Make me like one of your hired workers.\u2019","And he set out and came to his own father. But while he was still a long way away
 his father saw him and had compassion
 and ran and embraced him and kissed him. ","And his son said to him
 \u2018Father
 I have sinned against heaven and in your sight! I am no longer worthy to be called your son!\u2019 ","But his father said to his slaves
 \u2018Quickly bring out the best robe and put it on him
 and put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet! ","And bring the fattened calf\u2014kill it and let us eat and celebrate
 ","because this son of mine was dead
 and is alive again! He was lost and is found!\u2019 And they began to celebrate.","\u201cNow his older son was in the field
 and when he came and approached the house
 he heard music and dancing. ","And he summoned one of the slaves and asked what these things meant.","And he said to him
 \u2018Your brother has come
 and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has gotten him back healthy.\u2019 ","But he became angry and did not want to go in. So his father came out and began to implore him.","But he answered and said to his father
 \u2018Behold
 so many years I have served you
 and have never disobeyed your command! And you never gave me a young goat so that I could celebrate with my friends! ","But when this son of yours returned\u2014who has consumed your assets with prostitutes\u2014you killed the fattened calf for him!\u2019","But he said to him
 \u2018Child
 you are always with me
 and everything I have belongs to you. ","But it was necessary to celebrate and to rejoice
 because this brother of yours was dead
 and is alive
 and was lost
 and is found!\u2019\u201d","And he also said to the disciples
 \u201cA certain man was rich
 who had a manager. And charges were brought to him that this person was squandering his possessions. ","And he summoned him and said to him
 \u2018What is this I hear about you? Give the account of your management
 because you can no longer manage.\u2019 ","And the manager said to himself
 \u2018What should I do
 because my master is taking away the management from me? I am not strong enough to dig; I am ashamed to beg. ","I know what I should do
 so that when I am removed from the management they will welcome me into their homes!\u2019 ","And he summoned each one of his own master\u2019s debtors and said to the first
 \u2018How much do you owe my master?\u2019 ","And he said
 \u2018A hundred measures of olive oil.\u2019 So he said to him
 \u2018Take your promissory note and sit down quickly and write fifty.\u2019 ","Then he said to another
 \u2018And how much do you owe?\u2019 And he said
 \u2018A hundred measures of wheat.\u2019 He said to him
 \u2018Take your promissory note and write eighty.\u2019 ","And the master praised the dishonest manager
 because he had acted shrewdly. For the sons of this age are shrewder than the sons of light with regard to their own generation. ","And I tell you
 make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous wealth
 so that when it runs out they will welcome you into the eternal dwellings.","\u201cThe one who is faithful in very little is also faithful in much
 and the one who is dishonest in very little is also dishonest in much. ","If then you have not been faithful with unrighteous wealth
 who will entrust to you the true riches? ","And if you have not been faithful with what belongs to another
 who will give you your own? ","No domestic slave is able to serve two masters
 for either he will hate the one and love the other
 or he will be devoted to one and will despise the other. You are not able to serve God and money.\u201d","And he said to them
 \u201cYou are the ones who justify themselves in the sight of men
 but God knows your hearts! For what is considered exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God.","\u201cThe law and the prophets were until John; from that time on the kingdom of God has been proclaimed
 and everyone is urgently pressed into it. ","But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one stroke of a letter of the law to become invalid.","\u201cEveryone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery
 and the one who marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery.","\u201cNow a certain man was rich
 and dressed in purple cloth and fine linen
 feasting sumptuously every day. ","And a certain poor man named Lazarus
 covered with sores
 lay at his gate
 ","and was longing to be filled with what fell from the table of the rich man. But even the dogs came and licked his sores.","Now it happened that the poor man died
 and he was carried away by the angels to Abraham\u2019s side. And the rich man also died and was buried. ","And in Hades he lifted up his eyes as he was in torment and saw Abraham from a distance
 and Lazarus at his side. ","And he called out and said
 \u2018Father Abraham
 have mercy on me
 and send Lazarus so that he could dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue
 because I am suffering pain in this flame!\u2019 ","But Abraham said
 \u2018Child
 remember that you received your good things during your life
 and Lazarus likewise bad things. But now he is comforted here
 but you are suffering pain. ","And in addition to all these things
 a great chasm has been established between us and you
 so that those who want to cross over from here to you are not able to do so
 nor can they cross over from there to us.\u2019 ","So he said
 \u2018Then I ask you
 father
 that you send him to my father\u2019s house
 ","for I have five brothers
 so that he could warn them
 in order that they also should not come to this place of torment!\u2019 ","But Abraham said
 \u2018They have Moses and the prophets; they must listen to them.\u2019 ","And he said
 \u2018No
 father Abraham
 but if someone from the dead goes to them
 they will repent!\u2019 ","But he said to him
 \u2018If they do not listen to Moses and the prophets
 neither will they be convinced if someone rises from the dead.\u2019\u201d","And he said to his disciples
 \u201cIt is impossible for causes for stumbling not to come
 but woe to him through whom they come! ","It would be better for him if a millstone is placed around his neck and he is thrown into the sea than that he causes one of these little ones to sin.","\u201cBe concerned about yourselves! If your brother sins
 rebuke him
 and if he repents
 forgive him. ","And if he sins against you seven times in a day
 and seven times he returns to you saying
 \u2018I repent
\u2019 you must forgive him.\u201d","So the Lord said
 \u201cIf you have faith like a mustard seed
 you could say to this mulberry tree
 \u2018Be uprooted and planted in the sea
\u2019 and it would obey you.","\u201cAnd which of you who has a slave plowing or shepherding sheep who comes in from the field will say to him
 \u2018Come here at once and recline at the table\u2019? ","Will he not rather say to him
 \u2018Prepare something that I may eat
 and dress yourself to serve me while I eat and drink
 and after these things you will eat and drink.\u2019 ","He will not be grateful to the slave because he did what was ordered
 will he? ","Thus you also
 when you have done all the things you were ordered to do
 say
 \u2018We are unworthy slaves; we have done what we were obligated to do.\u2019\u201d","And it happened that while traveling toward Jerusalem
 he was passing through the region between Samaria and Galilee. ","And when he saw them he said to them
 \u201cGo and show yourselves to the priests.\u201d And it happened that as they were going
 they were cleansed. ","So Jesus answered and said
 \u201cWere not ten cleansed? And where are the nine? ","Was no one found to turn back and give praise to God except this foreigner?\u201d","And he said to him
 \u201cGet up and go your way. Your faith has saved you.\u201d","Now when he was asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come
 he answered them and said
 \u201cThe kingdom of God does not come with things that can be observed
 ","nor will they say
 \u2018Behold
 here it is!\u2019 or \u2018There!\u2019 For behold
 the kingdom of God is in your midst.\u201d","And he said to the disciples
 \u201cDays will come when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man
 and you will not see it. ","And they will say to you
 \u2018Behold
 there!\u2019 \u2018Behold
 here!\u2019 Do not go out or run after them! ","For just as the lightning shines forth
 flashing from one place under heaven to another place under heaven
 so the Son of Man will be in his day. ","But first it is necessary for him to suffer many things
 and to be rejected by this generation. ","And just as it was in the days of Noah
 so also it will be in the days of the Son of Man\u2014","they were eating
 they were drinking
 they were marrying
 they were being given in marriage
 until the day Noah entered into the ark
 and the flood came and destroyed them all. ","Likewise
 just as it was in the days of Lot\u2014they were eating
 they were drinking
 they were buying
 they were selling
 they were planting
 they were building. ","But on the day that Lot went out from Sodom
 it rained fire and sulphur from heaven and destroyed them all. ","It will be just the same on the day that the Son of Man is revealed.","On that day
 whoever is on the housetop and his goods are in the house must not come down to take them away. And likewise the one who is in the field must not turn back ","Remember Lot\u2019s wife!","Whoever seeks to preserve his life will lose it
 but whoever loses it will keep it. ","I tell you that in that night there will be two in one bed; one will be taken and the other will be left.","There will be two women grinding at the same place; one will be taken and the other will be left.\u201d","And they answered and said to him
 \u201cWhere
 Lord?\u201d So he said to them
 \u201cWhere the dead body is
 there also the vultures will be gathered.\u201d","saying
 \u201cThere was a certain judge in a certain town who did not fear God and did not respect people. ","And there was a widow in that town
 and she kept coming to him
 saying
 \u2018Grant me justice against my adversary!\u2019 ","And he was not willing for a time
 but after these things he said to himself
 \u2018Even if I do not fear God or respect people
 ","yet because this widow is causing trouble for me
 I will grant her justice
 so that she does not wear me down in the end by her coming back!\u2019\u201d ","And the Lord said
 \u201cListen to what the unrighteous judge is saying! ","And will not God surely see to it that justice is done to his chosen ones who cry out to him day and night
 and will he delay toward them? ","I tell you that he will see to it that justice is done for them soon! Nevertheless
 when the Son of Man comes
 then will he find faith on earth?\u201d","\u201cTwo men went up to the temple to pray
 one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. ","The Pharisee stood and prayed these things with reference to himself: \u2018God
 I give thanks to you that I am not like other people\u2014swindlers
 unrighteous people
 adulterers
 or even like this tax collector! ","I fast twice a week; I give a tenth of all that I get.\u2019","But the tax collector
 standing far away
 did not want even to raise his eyes to heaven
 but was beating his breast
 saying
 \u2018God
 be merciful to me
 a sinner!\u2019 ","I tell you
 this man went down to his house justified rather than that one! For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled
 but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.\u201d","But Jesus called them to himself
 saying
 \u201cAllow the children to come to me
 and do not forbid them
 for to such belongs the kingdom of God. ","Truly I say to you
 whoever does not welcome the kingdom of God like a young child will never enter into it.\u201d","And Jesus said to him
 \u201cWhy do you call me good? No one is good except God alone. ","You know the commandments: \u2018Do not commit adultery
 do not murder
 do not steal
 do not give false testimony
 honor your father and mother.\u2019\u201d ","And he said
 \u201cAll these I have observed from my youth.\u201d ","And when he heard this
 Jesus said to him
 \u201cYou still lack one thing: Sell all that you have
 and distribute the proceeds to the poor\u2014and you will have treasure in heaven\u2014and come
 follow me.\u201d ","And Jesus took notice of him and said
 \u201cHow difficult it is for those who possess wealth to enter into the kingdom of God! ","For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter into the kingdom of God.","But he said
 \u201cWhat is impossible with men is possible with God.\u201d","And he said to them
 \u201cTruly I say to you that there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children on account of the kingdom of God
 ","who will not receive many times more in this time and in the age to come
 eternal life.\u201d","And taking aside the twelve
 he said to them
 \u201cBehold
 we are going up to Jerusalem

 ","and after flogging him they will kill him
 and on the third day he will rise.\u201d ","And they understood none of these things
 and this saying was concealed from them
 and they did not comprehend the things that were said.","\u201cWhat do you want me to do for you?\u201d And he said
 \u201cLord
 that I may regain my sight. ","And Jesus said to him
 \u201cRegain your sight! Your faith has saved you.\u201d ","And when he came to the place
 Jesus looked up and said to him
 \u201cZacchaeus
 come down quickly
 because it is necessary for me to stay at your house today!\u201d ","And Zacchaeus stopped and said to the Lord
 \u201cBehold
 half of my possessions
 Lord
 I am giving to the poor
 and if I have extorted anything from anyone
 I am paying it back four times as much!\u201d ","And Jesus said to him
 \u201cToday salvation has come to this house
 because he too is a son of Abraham. ","For the Son of Man came to seek and to save those who are lost.\u201d","Therefore he said
 \u201cA certain nobleman traveled to a distant country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return. ","And summoning ten of his own slaves
 he gave them ten minas and said to them
 \u2018Do business until I come back.\u2019 ","But his citizens hated him
 and sent a delegation after him
 saying
 \u2018We do not want this man to be king over us!\u2019 ","And it happened that when he returned after receiving the kingdom
 he ordered these slaves to whom he had given the money to be summoned to him
 so that he could know what they had gained by trading. ","So the first arrived
 saying
 \u2018Sir
 your mina has made ten minas more!\u2019 ","And he said to him
 \u2018Well done
 good slave! Because you have been faithful in a very small thing

 saying
 \u2018Sir
 your mina has made five minas.\u2019 ","So he said to this one also
 \u2018And you be over five cities.\u2019 ","And another came
 saying
 \u2018Sir
 behold your mina
 which I had put away for safekeeping in a piece of cloth. ","For I was afraid of you
 because you are a severe man\u2014you withdraw what you did not deposit
 and you reap what you did not sow!\u2019 ","He said to him
 \u2018By your own words I will judge you
 wicked slave! You knew that I am a severe man
 withdrawing what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not sow. ","And why did you not give my money to the bank
 and I
 when I returned
 would have collected it with interest?\u2019 ","And to the bystanders he said
 \u2018Take away from him the mina and give it to the one who has the ten minas!\u2019 ","And they said to him
 \u2018Sir
 he has ten minas.\u2019 ","\u2018I tell you that to everyone who has
 more will be given. But from the one who does not have
 even what he has will be taken away. ","But these enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them\u2014bring them here and slaughter them in my presence!\u2019\u201d","saying
 \u2018Go into the village in front of you

 \u201cIf you had known on this day\u2014even you\u2014the things that make for peace! But now they are hidden from your eyes. ","For days will come upon you and your enemies will put up an embankment against you

 and leased it to tenant farmers

 so that they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenant farmers sent him away empty-handed after beating him. ","And he proceeded to send another slave
 but they beat and dishonored that one also
 and sent him away empty-handed. ","And he proceeded to send a third
 but they wounded and threw out this one also. ","So the owner of the vineyard said
 \u2018What should I do? I will send my beloved son; perhaps they will respect him.\u2019 ","But when the tenant farmers saw him
 they began to reason with one another
 saying
 \u2018This is the heir. Let us kill him so that the inheritance will become ours!\u2019 ","And they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?","He will come and destroy those tenant farmers and give the vineyard to others.\u201d And when they heard this
 they said
 \u201cMay this never happen!\u201d ","But he looked intently at them and said
 \u201cWhat then is this that is written: \u2018The stone which the builders rejected
 this has become the cornerstone.\u2019","Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces
 and the one on whom it falls\u2014it will crush him!\u201d ","And they watched him closely and sent spies who pretended they were upright
 in order that they could catch him in a statement

 \u201cCaesar\u2019s.\u201d ","So he said to them
 \u201cWell then
 give to Caesar the things of Caesar

 they became silent.","And Jesus said to them
 \u201cThe sons of this age marry and are given in marriage

 \u201cWhere is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?\u201d\u2019 ","And he will show you a large furnished upstairs room. Make preparations there.\u201d","And he said to them
 \u201cI have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer. ","For I tell you that I will not eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.\u201d","And he took in hand a cup

 \u201cTake this and share it among yourselves. ","For I tell you
 from now on I will not drink of the product of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.\u201d","And he took bread

 he broke it and gave it to them

 \u201cNothing.\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cBut now the one who has a money bag must take it

 what is written about me is being fulfilled.\u201d ","So they said
 \u201cLord
 behold
 here are two swords!\u201d And he said to them
 \u201cIt is adequate.\u201d","And when he came to the place

 \u201cPray that you will not enter into temptation.\u201d ","saying
 \u201cFather

 saying
 \u201cAre you the king of the Jews?\u201d And he answered him and said
 \u201cYou say so.\u201d ","Now when Pilate heard this

 \u201cWhy are you looking for the living among the dead? ","And he said to them
 \u201cWhat are these matters that you are discussing with one another as you are walking along?\u201d And they stood still
 looking sad. ","And he said to them
 \u201cWhat things?\u201d So they said to him
 \u201cThe things concerning Jesus the Nazarene

 \u201cO foolish and slow in heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken! ","Was it not necessary that the Christ suffer these things and enter into his glory?\u201d","And while they were saying these things
 he himself stood there among them. ","And he said to them
 \u201cWhy are you frightened? And for what reason do doubts arise in your hearts? ","Look at my hands and my feet
 that I am I myself! Touch me and see
 because a ghost does not have flesh and bones

 he said to them
 \u201cDo you have anything to eat here?\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cThese are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you
 that everything that is written about me in the law of Moses and the prophets and psalms must be fulfilled.\u201d ","and said to them
 \u201cThus it is written that the Christ would suffer and would rise from the dead on the third day
 ","and repentance and the forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed in his name to all the nations
 beginning from Jerusalem. ","You are witnesses of these things.","And behold
 I am sending out what was promised by my Father upon you
 but you stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high.\u201d","And he said to them
 \u201cWhy were you looking for me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father\u2019s house?\u201d ","Jesus answered him
 \u201cIt is written
 \u2018One does not live by bread alone.\u2019\u201d ","The devil said to him
 \u201cI shall give to you all this power and their glory; for it has been handed over to me

 \u2018You shall not put the Lord
 your God
 to the test.\u2019\u201d ","\u201cThe Spirit of the Lord is upon me

 \u201cToday this scripture passage is fulfilled in your hearing.\u201d ","He said to them

 \u2018Do here in your native place the things that we heard were done in Capernaum.\u2019\u201d ","And he said
 \u201cAmen
 I say to you
 no prophet is accepted in his own native place. ","Indeed
 I tell you
 there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah when the sky was closed for three and a half years and a severe famine spread over the entire land. ","It was to none of these that Elijah was sent
 but only to a widow in Zarephath in the land of Sidon. ","Again
 there were many lepers in Israel during the time of Elisha the prophet; yet not one of them was cleansed
 but only Naaman the Syrian.\u201d ","and they were astonished at his teaching because he spoke with authority. ","Jesus rebuked him and said
 \u201cBe quiet! Come out of him!\u201d Then the demon threw the man down in front of them and came out of him without doing him any harm. ","And demons also came out from many
 shouting
 \u201cYou are the Son of God.\u201d But he rebuked them and did not allow them to speak because they knew that he was the Messiah.","But he said to them
 \u201cTo the other towns also I must proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God

 he said to Simon
 \u201cPut out into deep water and lower your nets for a catch.\u201d ","and likewise James and John
 the sons of Zebedee

 \u201cDo not be afraid; from now on you will be catching men.\u201d ","Jesus stretched out his hand
 touched him

 \u201cI do will it. Be made clean.\u201d And the leprosy left him immediately. ","Then he ordered him not to tell anyone
 but \u201cGo
 show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing what Moses prescribed; that will be proof for them.\u201d ","When he saw their faith
 he said
 \u201cAs for you
 your sins are forgiven.\u201d ","Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them in reply
 \u201cWhat are you thinking in your hearts? ","Which is easier
 to say
 \u2018Your sins are forgiven
\u2019 or to say
 \u2018Rise and walk\u2019? ","But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins\u201d\u2014he said to the man who was paralyzed

 \u201cCan you make the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them? ","But the days will come
 and when the bridegroom is taken away from them
 then they will fast in those days.\u201d ","And he also told them a parable. \u201cNo one tears a piece from a new cloak to patch an old one. Otherwise

 no one pours new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise
 the new wine will burst the skins

 and the skins will be ruined. ","Rather
 new wine must be poured into fresh wineskins. "," no one who has been drinking old wine desires new

 what credit is that to you? Even sinners love those who love them. ","And if you do good to those who do good to you
 what credit is that to you? Even sinners do the same. ","If you lend money to those from whom you expect repayment
 what credit  that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners
 and get back the same amount. ","But rather
 love your enemies and do good to them

 nor does a rotten tree bear good fruit. ","For every tree is known by its own fruit. For people do not pick figs from thornbushes
 nor do they gather grapes from brambles. ","A good person out of the store of goodness in his heart produces good
 but an evil person out of a store of evil produces evil; for from the fullness of the heart the mouth speaks.","\u201cWhy do you call me
 \u2018Lord

 among those born of women

 \u201cSimon
 I have something to say to you.\u201d \u201cTell me

 \u201cYou have judged rightly.\u201d ","Then he turned to the woman and said to Simon
 \u201cDo you see this woman? When I entered your house
 you did not give me water for my feet

 but she has not ceased kissing my feet since the time I entered. ","You did not anoint my head with oil

 her many sins have been forgiven; hence
 she has shown great love. But the one to whom little is forgiven

 with people from one town after another journeying to him

 and hear but not understand.\u2019","\u201cThis is the meaning of the parable. The seed is the word of God. ","Those on the path are the ones who have heard

 when they hear
 receive the word with joy

 they are the ones who have heard

 they are choked by the anxieties and riches and pleasures of life

 when they have heard the word
 embrace it with a generous and good heart
 and bear fruit through perseverance.","\u201cNo one who lights a lamp conceals it with a vessel or sets it under a bed; rather

 then
 how you hear. To anyone who has
 more will be given

 \u2018The kingdom of God is at hand for you.\u2019 ","Whatever town you enter and they do not receive you
 go out into the streets and say
 ","\u2018The dust of your town that clings to our feet

 it will be more tolerable for Sodom on that day than for that town.","\u201cWoe to you
 Chorazin! Woe to you
 Bethsaida! For if the mighty deeds done in your midst had been done in Tyre and Sidon
 they would long ago have repented
 sitting in sackcloth and ashes. ","But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you. ","And as for you
 Capernaum
 \u2018Will you be exalted to heaven? You will go down to the netherworld.\u2019 ","Whoever listens to you listens to me. Whoever rejects you rejects me. And whoever rejects me rejects the one who sent me.\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cI have observed Satan fall like lightning from the sky. ","Behold
 I have given you the power \u2018to tread upon serpents\u2019 and scorpions and upon the full force of the enemy and nothing will harm you. ","Nevertheless
 do not rejoice because the spirits are subject to you
 but rejoice because your names are written in heaven.\u201d","At that very moment he rejoiced  the holy Spirit and said
 \u201cI give you praise
 Father
 Lord of heaven and earth
 for although you have hidden these things from the wise and the learned you have revealed them to the childlike. Yes
 Father
 such has been your gracious will. ","All things have been handed over to me by my Father. No one knows who the Son is except the Father
 and who the Father is except the Son and anyone to whom the Son wishes to reveal him.\u201d","Turning to the disciples in private he said
 \u201cBlessed are the eyes that see what you see. ","For I say to you
 many prophets and kings desired to see what you see
 but did not see it
 and to hear what you hear
 but did not hear it.\u201d","There was a scholar of the law who stood up to test him and said
 \u201cTeacher
 what must I do to inherit eternal life?\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cWhat is written in the law? How do you read it?\u201d ","He replied to him
 \u201cYou have answered correctly; do this and you will live.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cA man fell victim to robbers as he went down from Jerusalem to Jericho. They stripped and beat him and went off leaving him half-dead. ","A priest happened to be going down that road
 but when he saw him
 he passed by on the opposite side. ","Likewise a Levite came to the place
 and when he saw him
 he passed by on the opposite side. ","But a Samaritan traveler who came upon him was moved with compassion at the sight. ","He approached the victim
 poured oil and wine over his wounds and bandaged them. Then he lifted him up on his own animal
 took him to an inn and cared for him. ","The next day he took out two silver coins and gave them to the innkeeper with the instruction
 \u2018Take care of him. If you spend more than what I have given you
 I shall repay you on my way back.\u2019 ","Which of these three
 in your opinion
 was neighbor to the robbers\u2019 victim?\u201d ","He answered
 \u201cThe one who treated him with mercy.\u201d Jesus said to him
 \u201cGo and do likewise.\u201d","The Lord said to her in reply
 \u201cMartha
 Martha
 you are anxious and worried about many things. ","There is need of only one thing. Mary has chosen the better part and it will not be taken from her.\u201d","He was praying in a certain place
 and when he had finished
 one of his disciples said to him
 \u201cLord

 \u201cWhen you pray
 say: Father
 hallowed be your name

 \u201cSuppose one of you has a friend to whom he goes at midnight and says
 \u2018Friend
 lend me three loaves of bread
 ","for a friend of mine has arrived at my house from a journey and I have nothing to offer him
\u2019 ","and he says in reply from within
 \u2018Do not bother me; the door has already been locked and my children and I are already in bed. I cannot get up to give you anything.\u2019 ","I tell you
 if he does not get up to give him the loaves because of their friendship
 he will get up to give him whatever he needs because of his persistence.","\u201cAnd I tell you
 ask and you will receive; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. ","For everyone who asks
 receives; and the one who seeks
 finds; and to the one who knocks
 the door will be opened. ","What father among you would hand his son a snake when he asks for a fish? ","Or hand him a scorpion when he asks for an egg? ","If you then

 the mute person spoke and the crowds were amazed. ","But he knew their thoughts and said to them
 \u201cEvery kingdom divided against itself will be laid waste and house will fall against house. ","And if Satan is divided against himself
 how will his kingdom stand? For you say that it is by Beelzebul that I drive out demons. ","If I
 then
 drive out demons by Beelzebul
 by whom do your own people drive them out? Therefore they will be your judges. ","But if it is by the finger of God that  drive out demons
 then the kingdom of God has come upon you. ","When a strong man fully armed guards his palace
 his possessions are safe. ","But when one stronger than he attacks and overcomes him

 it roams through arid regions searching for rest but

 it says
 \u2018I shall return to my home from which I came.\u2019 ","But upon returning
 it finds it swept clean and put in order. ","Then it goes and brings back seven other spirits more wicked than itself who move in and dwell there
 and the last condition of that person is worse than the first.\u201d","While he was speaking
 a woman from the crowd called out and said to him
 \u201cBlessed is the womb that carried you and the breasts at which you nursed.\u201d ","He replied
 \u201cRather
 blessed are those who hear the word of God and observe it.\u201d","While still more people gathered in the crowd
 he said to them
 \u201cThis generation is an evil generation; it seeks a sign

 \u201cOh you Pharisees! Although you cleanse the outside of the cup and the dish
 inside you are filled with plunder and evil. ","You fools! Did not the maker of the outside also make the inside? ","But as to what is within
 give alms
 and behold
 everything will be clean for you. ","Woe to you Pharisees! You pay tithes of mint and of rue and of every garden herb

 without overlooking the others. ","Woe to you Pharisees! You love the seat of honor in synagogues and greetings in marketplaces. ","Woe to you! You are like unseen graves over which people unknowingly walk.\u201d","And he said
 \u201cWoe also to you scholars of the law! You impose on people burdens hard to carry

 you bear witness and give consent to the deeds of your ancestors
 for they killed them and you do the building. ","Therefore
 the wisdom of God said
 \u2018I will send to them prophets and apostles; some of them they will kill and persecute\u2019 ","in order that this generation might be charged with the blood of all the prophets shed since the foundation of the world
 ","from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah who died between the altar and the temple building. Yes
 I tell you

 scholars of the law! You have taken away the key of knowledge. You yourselves did not enter and you stopped those trying to enter.\u201d ","Meanwhile
 so many people were crowding together that they were trampling one another underfoot. He began to speak
 first to his disciples
 \u201cBeware of the leaven\u2014that is
 the hypocrisy\u2014of the Pharisees.","\u201cThere is nothing concealed that will not be revealed
 nor secret that will not be known. ","Therefore whatever you have said in the darkness will be heard in the light

 do not be afraid of those who kill the body but after that can do no more. ","I shall show you whom to fear. Be afraid of the one who after killing has the power to cast into Gehenna; yes
 I tell you
 be afraid of that one. ","Are not five sparrows sold for two small coins? Yet not one of them has escaped the notice of God. ","Even the hairs of your head have all been counted. Do not be afraid. You are worth more than many sparrows. ","I tell you
 everyone who acknowledges me before others the Son of Man will acknowledge before the angels of God. ","But whoever denies me before others will be denied before the angels of God.","\u201cEveryone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven
 but the one who blasphemes against the holy Spirit will not be forgiven. ","When they take you before synagogues and before rulers and authorities
 do not worry about how or what your defense will be or about what you are to say. ","For the holy Spirit will teach you at that moment what you should say.\u201d","He replied to him
 \u201cFriend
 who appointed me as your judge and arbitrator?\u201d ","Then he said to the crowd
 \u201cTake care to guard against all greed

 one\u2019s life does not consist of possessions.\u201d","Then he told them a parable. \u201cThere was a rich man whose land produced a bountiful harvest.","He asked himself
 \u2018What shall I do
 for I do not have space to store my harvest?\u2019 ","And he said
 \u2018This is what I shall do: I shall tear down my barns and build larger ones. There I shall store all my grain and other goods ","and I shall say to myself
 \u201cNow as for you
 you have so many good things stored up for many years
 rest
 eat
 drink
 be merry!\u201d\u2019 ","But God said to him
 \u2018You fool
 this night your life will be demanded of you; and the things you have prepared
 to whom will they belong?\u2019 ","Thus will it be for the one who stores up treasure for himself but is not rich in what matters to God.\u201d","He said to  disciples
 \u201cTherefore I tell you
 do not worry about your life and what you will eat
 or about your body and what you will wear.","For life is more than food and the body more than clothing. ","Notice the ravens: they do not sow or reap; they have neither storehouse nor barn
 yet God feeds them. How much more important are you than birds! ","Can any of you by worrying add a moment to your life-span? ","If even the smallest things are beyond your control
 why are you anxious about the rest? ","Notice how the flowers grow. They do not toil or spin. But I tell you
 not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of them. ","If God so clothes the grass in the field that grows today and is thrown into the oven tomorrow
 will he not much more provide for you
 O you of little faith? ","As for you
 do not seek what you are to eat and what you are to drink
 and do not worry anymore. ","All the nations of the world seek for these things
 and your Father knows that you need them. ","Instead
 seek his kingdom

 little flock
 for your Father is pleased to give you the kingdom. ","Sell your belongings and give alms. Provide money bags for yourselves that do not wear out
 an inexhaustible treasure in heaven that no thief can reach nor moth destroy. ","For where your treasure is
 there also will your heart be.","\u201cGird your loins and light your lamps ","and be like servants who await their master\u2019s return from a wedding
 ready to open immediately when he comes and knocks. ","Blessed are those servants whom the master finds vigilant on his arrival. Amen
 I say to you
 he will gird himself
 have them recline at table
 and proceed to wait on them. ","And should he come in the second or third watch and find them prepared in this way
 blessed are those servants. ","Be sure of this: if the master of the house had known the hour when the thief was coming
 he would not have let his house be broken into. ","You also must be prepared
 for at an hour you do not expect
 the Son of Man will come.\u201d","And the Lord replied
 \u201cWho
 then
 is the faithful and prudent steward whom the master will put in charge of his servants to distribute  food allowance at the proper time? ","Blessed is that servant whom his master on arrival finds doing so. ","Truly
 I say to you
 he will put him in charge of all his property. ","But if that servant says to himself
 \u2018My master is delayed in coming
\u2019 and begins to beat the menservants and the maidservants
 to eat and drink and get drunk
 ","then that servant\u2019s master will come on an unexpected day and at an unknown hour and will punish him severely and assign him a place with the unfaithful. ","That servant who knew his master\u2019s will but did not make preparations nor act in accord with his will shall be beaten severely; ","and the servant who was ignorant of his master\u2019s will but acted in a way deserving of a severe beating shall be beaten only lightly.

 I tell you
 but rather division. ","From now on a household of five will be divided
 three against two and two against three; ","a father will be divided against his son and a son against his father
 a mother against her daughter and a daughter against her mother
 a mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.\u201d","He also said to the crowds
 \u201cWhen you see  cloud rising in the west you say immediately that it is going to rain\u2014and so it does; ","and when you notice that the wind is blowing from the south you say that it is going to be hot\u2014and so it is. ","You hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky; why do you not know how to interpret the present time?","\u201cWhy do you not judge for yourselves what is right? ","If you are to go with your opponent before a magistrate
 make an effort to settle the matter on the way; otherwise your opponent will turn you over to the judge

 and the constable throw you into prison. ","I say to you
 you will not be released until you have paid the last penny.\u201d","He said to them in reply
 \u201cDo you think that because these Galileans suffered in this way they were greater sinners than all other Galileans? ","By no means! But I tell you

 you will all perish as they did! ","Or those eighteen people who were killed when the tower at Siloam fell on them\u2014do you think they were more guilty than everyone else who lived in Jerusalem? ","By no means! But I tell you
 if you do not repent
 you will all perish as they did!\u201d","And he told them this parable: \u201cThere once was a person who had a fig tree planted in his orchard
 and when he came in search of fruit on it but found none
 ","he said to the gardener
 \u2018For three years now I have come in search of fruit on this fig tree but have found none.  cut it down. Why should it exhaust the soil?\u2019 ","He said to him in reply
 \u2018Sir
 leave it for this year also

 he called to her and said
 \u201cWoman
 you are set free of your infirmity.\u201d ","The Lord said to him in reply
 \u201cHypocrites! Does not each one of you on the sabbath untie his ox or his ass from the manger and lead it out for watering? ","This daughter of Abraham
 whom Satan has bound for eighteen years now
 ought she not to have been set free on the sabbath day from this bondage?\u201d ","Then he said
 \u201cWhat is the kingdom of God like? To what can I compare it? ","It is like a mustard seed that a person took and planted in the garden. When it was fully grown
 it became a large bush and \u2018the birds of the sky dwelt in its branches.\u2019\u201d","Again he said
 \u201cTo what shall I compare the kingdom of God? ","It is like yeast that a woman took and mixed  with three measures of wheat flour until the whole batch of dough was leavened.\u201d","Someone asked him
 \u201cLord
 will only a few people be saved?\u201d He answered them
 ","\u201cStrive to enter through the narrow door

 \u2018We ate and drank in your company and you taught in our streets.\u2019 ","Then he will say to you

 asking
 \u201cIs it lawful to cure on the sabbath or not?\u201d ","Then he said to them
 \u201cWho among you

 when you are invited
 go and take the lowest place so that when the host comes to you he may say
 \u2018My friend
 move up to a higher position.\u2019 Then you will enjoy the esteem of your companions at the table. ","For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled
 but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.\u201d ","Then he said to the host who invited him
 \u201cWhen you hold a lunch or a dinner

 when you hold a banquet
 invite the poor
 the crippled

 the blind; ","blessed indeed will you be because of their inability to repay you. For you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.\u201d","One of his fellow guests on hearing this said to him
 \u201cBlessed is the one who will dine in the kingdom of God.\u201d ","He replied to him
 \u201cA man gave a great dinner to which he invited many. ","When the time for the dinner came
 he dispatched his servant to say to those invited
 \u2018Come
 everything is now ready.\u2019 ","But one by one
 they all began to excuse themselves. The first said to him
 \u2018I have purchased a field and must go to examine it; I ask you
 consider me excused.\u2019 ","And another said
 \u2018I have purchased five yoke of oxen and am on my way to evaluate them; I ask you
 consider me excused.\u2019 ","And another said
 \u2018I have just married a woman
 and therefore I cannot come.\u2019 ","The servant went and reported this to his master. Then the master of the house in a rage commanded his servant
 \u2018Go out quickly into the streets and alleys of the town and bring in here the poor and the crippled
 the blind and the lame.\u2019 ","The servant reported
 \u2018Sir
 your orders have been carried out and still there is room.\u2019 ","The master then ordered the servant
 \u2018Go out to the highways and hedgerows and make people come in that my home may be filled. ","For
 I tell you
 none of those men who were invited will taste my dinner.\u2019\u201d","Great crowds were traveling with him

 ","\u201cIf any one comes to me without hating his father and mother
 wife and children

 he cannot be my disciple. ","Whoever does not carry his own cross and come after me cannot be my disciple. ","Which of you wishing to construct a tower does not first sit down and calculate the cost to see if there is enough for its completion? ","Otherwise
 after laying the foundation and finding himself unable to finish the work the onlookers should laugh at him ","and say
 \u2018This one began to build but did not have the resources to finish.\u2019 ","Or what king marching into battle would not first sit down and decide whether with ten thousand troops he can successfully oppose another king advancing upon him with twenty thousand troops? ","But if not

 he sets it on his shoulders with great joy ","and
 upon his arrival home
 he calls together his friends and neighbors and says to them
 \u2018Rejoice with me because I have found my lost sheep.\u2019 ","I tell you
 in just the same way there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous people who have no need of repentance.","\u201cOr what woman having ten coins and losing one would not light a lamp and sweep the house
 searching carefully until she finds it?","And when she does find it
 she calls together her friends and neighbors and says to them
 \u2018Rejoice with me because I have found the coin that I lost.\u2019 ","In just the same way

 \u201cA man had two sons
","and the younger son said to his father
 \u2018Father
 give me the share of your estate that should come to me.\u2019 So the father divided the property between them. ","After a few days
 the younger son collected all his belongings and set off to a distant country where he squandered his inheritance on a life of dissipation. ","When he had freely spent everything
 a severe famine struck that country
 and he found himself in dire need. ","So he hired himself out to one of the local citizens who sent him to his farm to tend the swine. ","And he longed to eat his fill of the pods on which the swine fed
 but nobody gave him any. ","Coming to his senses he thought
 \u2018How many of my father\u2019s hired workers have more than enough food to eat
 but here am I
 dying from hunger. ","I shall get up and go to my father and I shall say to him
 \u201cFather
 I have sinned against heaven and against you. ","I no longer deserve to be called your son; treat me as you would treat one of your hired workers.\u201d\u2019 ","So he got up and went back to his father. While he was still a long way off
 his father caught sight of him
 and was filled with compassion. He ran to his son
 embraced him and kissed him. ","His son said to him
 \u2018Father
 I have sinned against heaven and against you; I no longer deserve to be called your son.\u2019 ","But his father ordered his servants
 \u2018Quickly bring the finest robe and put it on him; put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. ","Take the fattened calf and slaughter it. Then let us celebrate with a feast
 ","because this son of mine was dead
 and has come to life again; he was lost
 and has been found.\u2019 Then the celebration began. ","Now the older son had been out in the field and
 on his way back
 as he neared the house
 he heard the sound of music and dancing. ","He called one of the servants and asked what this might mean. ","The servant said to him
 \u2018Your brother has returned and your father has slaughtered the fattened calf because he has him back safe and sound.\u2019 ","He became angry
 and when he refused to enter the house
 his father came out and pleaded with him. ","He said to his father in reply
 \u2018Look
 all these years I served you and not once did I disobey your orders; yet you never gave me even a young goat to feast on with my friends. ","But when your son returns who swallowed up your property with prostitutes
 for him you slaughter the fattened calf.\u2019 ","He said to him
 \u2018My son
 you are here with me always; everything I have is yours. ","But now we must celebrate and rejoice
 because your brother was dead and has come to life again; he was lost and has been found.\u2019\u201d","Then he also said to his disciples
 \u201cA rich man had a steward who was reported to him for squandering his property.","He summoned him and said
 \u2018What is this I hear about you? Prepare a full account of your stewardship
 because you can no longer be my steward.\u2019 ","The steward said to himself
 \u2018What shall I do
 now that my master is taking the position of steward away from me? I am not strong enough to dig and I am ashamed to beg. ","I know what I shall do so that
 when I am removed from the stewardship
 they may welcome me into their homes.\u2019 ","He called in his master\u2019s debtors one by one. To the first he said
 \u2018How much do you owe my master?\u2019 ","He replied
 \u2018One hundred measures of olive oil.\u2019 He said to him
 \u2018Here is your promissory note. Sit down and quickly write one for fifty.\u2019 ","Then to another he said
 \u2018And you
 how much do you owe?\u2019 He replied
 \u2018One hundred kors of wheat.\u2019 He said to him
 \u2018Here is your promissory note; write one for eighty.\u2019 ","And the master commended that dishonest steward for acting prudently. \u201cFor the children of this world are more prudent in dealing with their own generation than are the children of light.","I tell you
 make friends for yourselves with dishonest wealth
 so that when it fails
 you will be welcomed into eternal dwellings. ","The person who is trustworthy in very small matters is also trustworthy in great ones; and the person who is dishonest in very small matters is also dishonest in great ones. ","If
 therefore
 you are not trustworthy with dishonest wealth
 who will trust you with true wealth? ","If you are not trustworthy with what belongs to another
 who will give you what is yours? ","No servant can serve two masters. He will either hate one and love the other
 or be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.\u201d","And he said to them
 \u201cYou justify yourselves in the sight of others
 but God knows your hearts; for what is of human esteem is an abomination in the sight of God.","\u201cThe law and the prophets lasted until John; but from then on the kingdom of God is proclaimed
 and everyone who enters does so with violence.","It is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for the smallest part of a letter of the law to become invalid.","\u201cEveryone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery
 and the one who marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery.","\u201cThere was a rich man who dressed in purple garments and fine linen and dined sumptuously each day. ","And lying at his door was a poor man named Lazarus
 covered with sores
 ","who would gladly have eaten his fill of the scraps that fell from the rich man\u2019s table. Dogs even used to come and lick his sores. ","When the poor man died
 he was carried away by angels to the bosom of Abraham. The rich man also died and was buried
 ","and from the netherworld
 where he was in torment
 he raised his eyes and saw Abraham far off and Lazarus at his side. ","And he cried out
 \u2018Father Abraham
 have pity on me. Send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue
 for I am suffering torment in these flames.\u2019 ","Abraham replied
 \u2018My child
 remember that you received what was good during your lifetime while Lazarus likewise received what was bad; but now he is comforted here
 whereas you are tormented. ","Moreover
 between us and you a great chasm is established to prevent anyone from crossing who might wish to go from our side to yours or from your side to ours.\u2019 ","He said
 \u2018Then I beg you
 father
 send him to my father\u2019s house
 ","for I have five brothers
 so that he may warn them
 lest they too come to this place of torment.\u2019 ","But Abraham replied
 \u2018They have Moses and the prophets. Let them listen to them.\u2019 ","He said
 \u2018Oh no
 father Abraham
 but if someone from the dead goes to them
 they will repent.\u2019 ","Then Abraham said
 \u2018If they will not listen to Moses and the prophets
 neither will they be persuaded if someone should rise from the dead.\u2019\u201d","He said to his disciples
 \u201cThings that cause sin will inevitably occur
 but woe to the person through whom they occur.","It would be better for him if a millstone were put around his neck and he be thrown into the sea than for him to cause one of these little ones to sin. ","Be on your guard! If your brother sins
 rebuke him; and if he repents
 forgive him. ","And if he wrongs you seven times in one day and returns to you seven times saying
 \u2018I am sorry
\u2019 you should forgive him.\u201d","The Lord replied
 \u201cIf you have faith the size of a mustard seed
 you would say to  mulberry tree
 \u2018Be uprooted and planted in the sea
\u2019 and it would obey you.","\u201cWho among you would say to your servant who has just come in from plowing or tending sheep in the field
 \u2018Come here immediately and take your place at table\u2019? ","Would he not rather say to him
 \u2018Prepare something for me to eat. Put on your apron and wait on me while I eat and drink. You may eat and drink when I am finished\u2019? ","Is he grateful to that servant because he did what was commanded? ","So should it be with you. When you have done all you have been commanded
 say
 \u2018We are unprofitable servants; we have done what we were obliged to do.\u2019\u201d","As he continued his journey to Jerusalem
 he traveled through Samaria and Galilee. ","And when he saw them
 he said
 \u201cGo show yourselves to the priests.\u201d As they were going they were cleansed. ","Jesus said in reply
 \u201cTen were cleansed
 were they not? Where are the other nine? ","Has none but this foreigner returned to give thanks to God?\u201d ","Then he said to him
 \u201cStand up and go; your faith has saved you.\u201d","Asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come
 he said in reply
 \u201cThe coming of the kingdom of God cannot be observed
","and no one will announce
 \u2018Look
 here it is
\u2019 or
 \u2018There it is.\u2019 For behold
 the kingdom of God is among you.\u201d","Then he said to his disciples
 \u201cThe days will come when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man
 but you will not see it.","There will be those who will say to you
 \u2018Look
 there he is
\u2019  \u2018Look
 here he is.\u2019 Do not go off
 do not run in pursuit. ","For just as lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one side to the other
 so will the Son of Man be [in his day]. ","But first he must suffer greatly and be rejected by this generation. ","As it was in the days of Noah
 so it will be in the days of the Son of Man; ","they were eating and drinking
 marrying and giving in marriage up to the day that Noah entered the ark
 and the flood came and destroyed them all. ","Similarly
 as it was in the days of Lot: they were eating
 drinking
 buying
 selling
 planting
 building; ","on the day when Lot left Sodom
 fire and brimstone rained from the sky to destroy them all. ","So it will be on the day the Son of Man is revealed. ","On that day
 a person who is on the housetop and whose belongings are in the house must not go down to get them
 and likewise a person in the field must not return to what was left behind. ","Remember the wife of Lot. ","Whoever seeks to preserve his life will lose it
 but whoever loses it will save it. ","I tell you
 on that night there will be two people in one bed; one will be taken
 the other left. ","And there will be two women grinding meal together; one will be taken
 the other left.\u201d  [36 ] ","They said to him in reply
 \u201cWhere
 Lord?\u201d He said to them
 \u201cWhere the body is
 there also the vultures will gather.\u201d","\u201cThere was a judge in a certain town who neither feared God nor respected any human being. ","And a widow in that town used to come to him and say
 \u2018Render a just decision for me against my adversary.\u2019 ","For a long time the judge was unwilling
 but eventually he thought
 \u2018While it is true that I neither fear God nor respect any human being
 ","because this widow keeps bothering me I shall deliver a just decision for her lest she finally come and strike me.\u2019\u201d ","The Lord said
 \u201cPay attention to what the dishonest judge says. ","Will not God then secure the rights of his chosen ones who call out to him day and night? Will he be slow to answer them? ","I tell you
 he will see to it that justice is done for them speedily. But when the Son of Man comes
 will he find faith on earth?\u201d","\u201cTwo people went up to the temple area to pray; one was a Pharisee and the other was a tax collector. ","The Pharisee took up his position and spoke this prayer to himself
 \u2018O God
 I thank you that I am not like the rest of humanity\u2014greedy
 dishonest
 adulterous\u2014or even like this tax collector. ","I fast twice a week
 and I pay tithes on my whole income.\u2019 ","But the tax collector stood off at a distance and would not even raise his eyes to heaven but beat his breast and prayed
 \u2018O God
 be merciful to me a sinner.\u2019 ","I tell you
 the latter went home justified
 not the former; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled
 and the one who humbles himself will be exalted.\u201d","Jesus
 however
 called the children to himself and said
 \u201cLet the children come to me and do not prevent them; for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. ","Amen
 I say to you
 whoever does not accept the kingdom of God like a child will not enter it.\u201d","Jesus answered him
 \u201cWhy do you call me good? No one is good but God alone. ","You know the commandments
 \u2018You shall not commit adultery; you shall not kill; you shall not steal; you shall not bear false witness; honor your father and your mother.\u2019\u201d ","And he replied
 \u201cAll of these I have observed from my youth.\u201d ","When Jesus heard this he said to him
 \u201cThere is still one thing left for you: sell all that you have and distribute it to the poor
 and you will have a treasure in heaven. Then come
 follow me.\u201d ","Jesus looked at him [now sad] and said
 \u201cHow hard it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God!","For it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.\u201d ","And he said
 \u201cWhat is impossible for human beings is possible for God.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cAmen
 I say to you
 there is no one who has given up house or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God ","who will not receive  an overabundant return in this present age and eternal life in the age to come.\u201d","Then he took the Twelve aside and said to them
 \u201cBehold
 we are going up to Jerusalem and everything written by the prophets about the Son of Man will be fulfilled. ","He will be handed over to the Gentiles and he will be mocked and insulted and spat upon; ","and after they have scourged him they will kill him

 \u201cLord

 \u201cHave sight; your faith has saved you.\u201d ","When he reached the place
 Jesus looked up and said to him
 \u201cZacchaeus

 \u201cToday salvation has come to this house because this man too is a descendant of Abraham. ","For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save what was lost.\u201d","So he said
 \u201cA nobleman went off to a distant country to obtain the kingship for himself and then to return. ","He called ten of his servants and gave them ten gold coins and told them

 despised him and sent a delegation after him to announce

 he had the servants called
 to whom he had given the money
 to learn what they had gained by trading. ","The first came forward and said
 \u2018Sir
 your gold coin has earned ten additional ones.\u2019 ","He replied
 \u2018Well done
 good servant! You have been faithful in this very small matter; take charge of ten cities.\u2019 ","Then the second came and reported
 \u2018Your gold coin
 sir
 has earned five more.\u2019 ","And to this servant too he said
 \u2018You
 take charge of five cities.\u2019 ","Then the other servant came and said
 \u2018Sir
 here is your gold coin; I kept it stored away in a handkerchief
 ","for I was afraid of you
 because you are a demanding person; you take up what you did not lay down and you harvest what you did not plant.\u2019 ","He said to him
 \u2018With your own words I shall condemn you
 you wicked servant. You knew I was a demanding person
 taking up what I did not lay down and harvesting what I did not plant; ","why did you not put my money in a bank? Then on my return I would have collected it with interest.\u2019 ","And to those standing by he said
 \u2018Take the gold coin from him and give it to the servant who has ten.\u2019 ","But they said to him
 \u2018Sir
 he has ten gold coins.\u2019 ","\u2018I tell you
 to everyone who has
 more will be given

 even what he has will be taken away. ","Now as for those enemies of mine who did not want me as their king
 bring them here and slay them before me.\u2019\u201d VI. The Teaching Ministry in Jerusalem","He said
 \u201cGo into the village opposite you

 \u2018Why are you untying it?\u2019 you will answer
 \u2018The Master has need of it.\u2019\u201d ","Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him
 \u201cTeacher

 ","was John\u2019s baptism of heavenly or of human origin?\u201d ","Then Jesus said to them
 \u201cNeither shall I tell you by what authority I do these things.\u201d","Then he proceeded to tell the people this parable. \u201c man planted a vineyard
 leased it to tenant farmers
 and then went on a journey for a long time. ","At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenant farmers to receive some of the produce of the vineyard. But they beat the servant and sent him away empty-handed. ","So he proceeded to send another servant
 but him also they beat and insulted and sent away empty-handed. ","Then he proceeded to send a third
 but this one too they wounded and threw out. ","The owner of the vineyard said
 \u2018What shall I do? I shall send my beloved son; maybe they will respect him.\u2019 ","But when the tenant farmers saw him they said to one another
 \u2018This is the heir. Let us kill him that the inheritance may become ours.\u2019 ","So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What will the owner of the vineyard do to them? ","He will come and put those tenant farmers to death and turn over the vineyard to others.\u201d When the people heard this
 they exclaimed
 \u201cLet it not be so!\u201d ","But he looked at them and asked
 \u201cWhat then does this scripture passage mean: \u2018The stone which the builders rejected has become the cornerstone\u2019?","Everyone who falls on that stone will be dashed to pieces; and it will crush anyone on whom it falls.\u201d ","They watched him closely and sent agents pretending to be righteous who were to trap him in speech

 \u201cCaesar\u2019s.\u201d ","So he said to them
 \u201cThen repay to Caesar what belongs to Caesar and to God what belongs to God.\u201d ","They were unable to trap him by something he might say before the people

 \u201cThe children of this age marry and are given in marriage; ","but those who are deemed worthy to attain to the coming age and to the resurrection of the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage. ","They can no longer die

 \u201cIt is written: \u2018You shall worship the Lord your God and serve Him only.\u2019\u201d","And he brought Him into Jerusalem and had Him stand on the pinnacle of the temple
 and said to Him
 \u201cIf You are the Son of God
 throw Yourself down from here;","And Jesus answered and said to him
 \u201cIt has been stated
 \u2018You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.\u2019\u201d","\u201cThe Spirit of the Lord is upon Me
 Because He anointed Me to bring good news to the poor. He has sent Me to proclaim release to captives
 And recovery of sight to the blind
 To set free those who are oppressed
","To proclaim the favorable year of the Lord.\u201d","Now He began to say to them
 \u201cToday this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cNo doubt you will quote this proverb to Me: \u2018Physician
 heal yourself! All the miracles that we heard were done in Capernaum
 do here in your hometown as well.\u2019\u201d","But He said
 \u201cTruly I say to you
 no prophet is welcome in his hometown.","But I say to you in truth
 there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah
 when the sky was shut up for three years and six months
 when a severe famine came over all the land;","and yet Elijah was sent to none of them
 but only to Zarephath
 in the land of Sidon
 to a woman who was a widow.","And there were many with leprosy in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet; and none of them was cleansed
 but only Naaman the Syrian.\u201d","and they were amazed at His teaching
 because His message was delivered with authority.","But Jesus rebuked him
 saying
 \u201cBe quiet and come out of him!\u201d And when the demon had thrown him down in the midst of the people
 it came out of him without doing him any harm.","Demons also were coming out of many
 shouting
 \u201cYou are the Son of God!\u201d And yet He was rebuking them and would not allow them to speak
 because they knew that He was the Christ.","But He said to them
 \u201cI must also preach the kingdom of God to the other cities
 because I was sent for this purpose.\u201d","Now when He had finished speaking
 He said to Simon
 \u201cPut out into the deep water and let down your nets for a catch.\u201d","and likewise also were James and John
 sons of Zebedee
 who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon
 \u201cDo not fear; from now on you will be catching people.\u201d","And He reached out with His hand and touched him
 saying
 \u201cI am willing; be cleansed.\u201d And immediately the leprosy left him.","And He ordered him to tell no one
 saying
 \u201cBut go and show yourself to the priest
 and make an offering for your cleansing
 just as Moses commanded
 as a testimony to them.\u201d","And seeing their faith
 He said
 \u201cFriend
 your sins are forgiven you.\u201d","But Jesus
 aware of their thoughts
 responded and said to them
 \u201cWhy are you thinking this way in your hearts?","Which is easier
 to say: \u2018Your sins are forgiven you
\u2019 or to say
 \u2018Get up and walk\u2019?","But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins
\u201d He said to the man who was paralyzed
 \u201cI say to you
 get up
 and pick up your stretcher
 and go home.\u201d","After that He went out and looked at a tax collector named Levi sitting in the tax office
 and He said to him
 \u201cFollow Me.\u201d","And Jesus answered and said to them
 \u201cIt is not those who are healthy who need a physician
 but those who are sick.","I have not come to call the righteous to repentance
 but sinners.\u201d","And they said to Him
 \u201cThe disciples of John often fast and offer prayers
 the disciples of the Pharisees also do the same
 but Yours eat and drink.\u201d","And Jesus said to them
 \u201cYou cannot make the attendants of the groom fast while the groom is with them
 can you?","But the days will come; and when the groom is taken away from them
 then they will fast in those days.\u201d","And He was also telling them a parable: \u201cNo one tears a piece of cloth from a new garment and puts it on an old garment; otherwise he will both tear the new
 and the patch from the new garment will not match the old.","And no one pours new wine into old wineskins; otherwise the new wine will burst the skins and it will be spilled out
 and the skins will be ruined.","But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins.","And no one
 after drinking old wine wants new; for he says
 \u2018The old is fine.\u2019\u201d","And Jesus
 answering them
 said
 \u201cHave you not even read what David did when he was hungry
 he and those who were with him
","how he entered the house of God
 and took and ate the consecrated bread
 which is not lawful for anyone to eat except the priests alone
 and gave it to his companions?\u201d","And He was saying to them
 \u201cThe Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.\u201d","But He knew what they were thinking
 and He said to the man with the withered hand
 \u201cGet up and come forward!\u201d And he got up and came forward.","And Jesus said to them
 \u201cI ask you whether it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath or to do harm
 to save a life or to destroy it?\u201d","And after looking around at them all
 He said to him
 \u201cStretch out your hand!\u201d And he did so; and his hand was restored.","Blessed are you who are hungry now
 for you will be satisfied. Blessed are you who weep now
 for you will laugh.","Blessed are you when the people hate you
 and when they exclude you
 and insult you
 and scorn your name as evil
 on account of the Son of Man.","Rejoice on that day and jump for joy
 for behold
 your reward is great in heaven. For their fathers used to treat the prophets the same way.","But woe to you who are rich
 for you are receiving your comfort in full.","Woe to you who are well-fed now
 for you will be hungry. Woe to you who laugh now
 for you will mourn and weep.","Woe to you when all the people speak well of you; for their fathers used to treat the false prophets the same way.","\u201cBut I say to you who hear
 love your enemies
 do good to those who hate you
","bless those who curse you
 pray for those who are abusive to you.","Whoever hits you on the cheek
 offer him the other also; and whoever takes away your cloak
 do not withhold your tunic from him either.","Give to everyone who asks of you
 and whoever takes away what is yours
 do not demand it back.","Treat people the same way you want them to treat you.","If you love those who love you
 what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them.","And if you do good to those who do good to you
 what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same.","And if you lend to those from whom you expect to receive
 what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners in order to receive back the same amount.","But love your enemies and do good
 and lend
 expecting nothing in return; and your reward will be great
 and you will be sons of the Most High; for He Himself is kind to ungrateful and evil people.","Be merciful
 just as your Father is merciful.","\u201cDo not judge
 and you will not be judged; and do not condemn
 and you will not be condemned; pardon
 and you will be pardoned.","Give
 and it will be given to you. They will pour into your lap a good measure\u2014pressed down
 shaken together
 and running over. For by your standard of measure it will be measured to you in return.\u201d","Now He also spoke a parable to them: \u201cA person who is blind cannot guide another who is blind
 can he? Will they not both fall into a pit?","A student is not above the teacher; but everyone
 when he has been fully trained
 will be like his teacher.","Why do you look at the speck that is in your brother\u2019s eye
 but do not notice the log that is in your own eye?","How can you say to your brother
 \u2018Brother
 let me take out the speck that is in your eye
\u2019 when you yourself do not see the log that is in your own eye? You hypocrite
 first take the log out of your own eye
 and then you will see clearly to take out the speck that is in your brother\u2019s eye.","For there is no good tree that bears bad fruit
 nor
 on the other hand
 a bad tree that bears good fruit.","For each tree is known by its own fruit. For people do not gather figs from thorns
 nor do they pick grapes from a briar bush.","The good person out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth what is good; and the evil person out of the evil treasure brings forth what is evil; for his mouth speaks from that which fills his heart.","\u201cNow why do you call Me
 \u2018Lord
 Lord
\u2019 and do not do what I say?","Everyone who comes to Me and hears My words and acts on them
 I will show you whom he is like:","he is like a man building a house
 who dug deep and laid a foundation on the rock; and when there was a flood
 the river burst against that house and yet it could not shake it
 because it had been well built.","But the one who has heard and has not acted accordingly is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation; and the river burst against it and it immediately collapsed
 and the ruin of that house was great.\u201d","Now when Jesus heard this
 He was amazed at him
 and turned and said to the crowd that was following Him
 \u201cI say to you
 not even in Israel have I found such great faith.\u201d","When the Lord saw her
 He felt compassion for her and said to her
 \u201cDo not go on weeping.\u201d","And He came up and touched the coffin; and the bearers came to a halt. And He said
 \u201cYoung man
 I say to you
 arise!\u201d","And He answered and said to them
 \u201cGo and report to John what you have seen and heard: people who were blind receive sight
 people who limped walk
 people with leprosy are cleansed and people who were deaf hear
 dead people are raised up
 and people who are poor have the gospel preached to them.","And blessed is anyone who does not take offense at Me.\u201d","When the messengers of John had left
 He began to speak to the crowds about John: \u201cWhat did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?","But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Those who are splendidly clothed and live in luxury are found in royal palaces!","But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes
 I tell you
 and one who is more than a prophet.","This is the one about whom it is written: \u2018Behold
 I am sending My messenger ahead of You
 Who will prepare Your way before You.\u2019","I say to you
 among those born of women there is no one greater than John; yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.\u201d","\u201cTo what then shall I compare the people of this generation
 and what are they like?","They are like children who sit in the marketplace and call to one another
 and say
 \u2018We played the flute for you
 and you did not dance; we sang a song of mourning
 and you did not weep.\u2019","For John the Baptist has come neither eating bread nor drinking wine
 and you say
 \u2018He has a demon!\u2019","The Son of Man has come eating and drinking
 and you say
 \u2018Behold
 a gluttonous man and a heavy drinker
 a friend of tax collectors and sinners!\u2019","And yet wisdom is vindicated by all her children.\u201d","Now when the Pharisee who had invited Him saw this
 he said to himself
 \u201cIf this man were a prophet He would know who and what sort of person this woman is who is touching Him
 that she is a sinner!\u201d","And Jesus responded and said to him
 \u201cSimon
 I have something to say to you.\u201d And he replied
 \u201cSay it
 Teacher.\u201d","\u201cA moneylender had two debtors: the one owed five hundred denarii
 and the other
 fifty.","When they were unable to repay
 he canceled the debts of both. So which of them will love him more?\u201d","Simon answered and said
 \u201cI assume the one for whom he canceled the greater debt.\u201d And He said to him
 \u201cYou have judged correctly.\u201d","And turning toward the woman
 He said to Simon
 \u201cDo you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave Me no water for My feet
 but she has wet My feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.","You gave Me no kiss; but she has not stopped kissing My feet since the time I came in.","You did not anoint My head with oil
 but she anointed My feet with perfume.","For this reason I say to you
 her sins
 which are many
 have been forgiven
 for she loved much; but the one who is forgiven little
 loves little.\u201d","And He said to her
 \u201cYour sins have been forgiven.\u201d","And He said to the woman
 \u201cYour faith has saved you; go in peace.\u201d","Now when a large crowd was coming together
 and those from the various cities were journeying to Him
 He spoke by way of a parable:","\u201cThe sower went out to sow his seed; and as he sowed
 some fell beside the road
 and it was trampled underfoot
 and the birds of the sky ate it up.","Other seed fell on rocky soil
 and when it came up
 it withered away because it had no moisture.","Other seed fell among the thorns; and the thorns grew up with it and choked it out.","And yet other seed fell into the good soil
 and grew up
 and produced a crop a hundred times as much.\u201d As He said these things
 He would call out
 \u201cThe one who has ears to hear
 let him hear.\u201d","And He said
 \u201cTo you it has been granted to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God
 but to the rest they are told in parables
 so that while seeing they may not see
 and while hearing they may not understand.","\u201cNow this is the parable: the seed is the word of God.","And those beside the road are the ones who have heard
 then the devil comes and takes away the word from their heart
 so that they will not believe and be saved.","Those on the rocky soil are the ones who
 when they hear
 receive the word with joy; and yet these do not have a firm root; they believe for a while
 and in a time of temptation they fall away.","And the seed which fell among the thorns
 these are the ones who have heard
 and as they go on their way they are choked by worries
 riches
 and pleasures of this life
 and they bring no fruit to maturity.","But the seed in the good soil
 these are the ones who have heard the word with a good and virtuous heart
 and hold it firmly
 and produce fruit with perseverance.","\u201cNow no one lights a lamp and covers it over with a container
 or puts it under a bed; but he puts it on a lampstand so that those who come in may see the light.","For nothing is concealed that will not become evident
 nor anything hidden that will not be known and come to light.","So take care how you listen; for whoever has
 to him more will be given; and whoever does not have
 even what he thinks he has will be taken away from him.\u201d","And it was reported to Him
 \u201cYour mother and Your brothers are standing outside
 wishing to see You.\u201d","But He answered and said to them
 \u201cMy mother and My brothers are these who hear the word of God and do it.\u201d","Now on one of those days Jesus and His disciples got into a boat
 and He said to them
 \u201cLet\u2019s cross over to the other side of the lake.\u201d So they launched out.","And He said to them
 \u201cWhere is your faith?\u201d But they were fearful and amazed
 saying to one another
 \u201cWho then is this
 that He commands even the winds and the water
 and they obey Him?\u201d","And Jesus asked him
 \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d And he said
 \u201cLegion\u201d; because many demons had entered him.","\u201cReturn to your home and describe what great things God has done for you.\u201d So he went away
 proclaiming throughout the city what great things Jesus had done for him.","And Jesus said
 \u201cWho is the one who touched Me?\u201d And while they were all denying it
 Peter said
 \u201cMaster
 the people are crowding and pressing in on You.\u201d","But Jesus said
 \u201cSomeone did touch Me
 for I was aware that power had left Me.\u201d","And He said to her
 \u201cDaughter
 your faith has made you well; go in peace.\u201d","But when Jesus heard this
 He responded to him
 \u201cDo not be afraid any longer; only believe
 and she will be made well.\u201d","Now they were all weeping and mourning for her; but He said
 \u201cStop weeping
 for she has not died
 but is asleep.\u201d","He
 however
 took her by the hand and spoke forcefully
 saying
 \u201cChild
 arise!\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cTake nothing for your journey
 neither a staff
 nor a bag
 nor bread
 nor money; and do not even have two tunics.","And whatever house you enter
 stay there until you leave that city.","And as for all who do not receive you
 when you leave that city
 shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them.\u201d","But He said to them
 \u201cYou give them something to eat!\u201d But they said
 \u201cWe have no more than five loaves and two fish
 unless perhaps we go and buy food for all these people.\u201d","(For there were about five thousand men.) But He said to His disciples
 \u201cHave them recline to eat in groups of about fifty each.\u201d","And it happened that while He was praying alone
 the disciples were with Him
 and He questioned them
 saying
 \u201cWho do the people say that I am?\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cBut who do you say that I am?\u201d And Peter answered and said
 \u201cThe Christ of God.\u201d","saying
 \u201cThe Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes
 and be killed and be raised on the third day.\u201d","And He was saying to them all
 \u201cIf anyone wants to come after Me
 he must deny himself
 take up his cross daily
 and follow Me.","For whoever wants to save his life will lose it
 but whoever loses his life for My sake
 this is the one who will save it.","For what good does it do a person if he gains the whole world
 but loses or forfeits himself?","For whoever is ashamed of Me and My words
 the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when He comes in His glory and the glory of the Father and the holy angels.","But I say to you truthfully
 there are some of those standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God.\u201d","And as these two men were leaving Him
 Peter said to Jesus
 \u201cMaster
 it is good that we are here; and let\u2019s make three tabernacles: one for You
 one for Moses
 and one for Elijah\u201d\u2014not realizing what he was saying.","And Jesus answered and said
 \u201cYou unbelieving and perverse generation
 how long shall I be with you and put up with you? Bring your son here.\u201d","\u201cAs for you
 let these words sink into your ears: for the Son of Man is going to be handed over to men.\u201d","and He said to them
 \u201cWhoever receives this child in My name receives Me
 and whoever receives Me receives Him who sent Me; for the one who is least among all of you
 this is the one who is great.\u201d","But Jesus said to him
 \u201cDo not hinder him; for the one who is not against you is for you.\u201d","And Jesus said to him
 \u201cThe foxes have holes and the birds of the sky have nests
 but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head.\u201d","And He said to another
 \u201cFollow Me.\u201d But he said
 \u201cLord
 permit me first to go and bury my father.\u201d","But He said to him
 \u201cAllow the dead to bury their own dead; but as for you
 go and proclaim everywhere the kingdom of God.\u201d","But Jesus said to him
 \u201cNo one
 after putting his hand to the plow and looking back
 is fit for the kingdom of God.\u201d","And He was saying to them
 \u201cThe harvest is plentiful
 but the laborers are few; therefore plead with the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest.","Go; behold
 I am sending you out like lambs in the midst of wolves.","Carry no money belt
 no bag
 no sandals
 and greet no one along the way.","And whatever house you enter
 first say
 \u2018Peace be to this house.\u2019","And if a man of peace is there
 your peace will rest upon him; but if not
 it will return to you.","Stay in that house
 eating and drinking what they provide; for the laborer is deserving of his wages. Do not move from house to house.","Whatever city you enter and they receive you
 eat what is served to you;","and heal those in it who are sick
 and say to them
 \u2018The kingdom of God has come near to you.\u2019","But whatever city you enter and they do not receive you
 go out into its streets and say
","\u2018Even the dust of your city which clings to our feet we wipe off in protest against you; yet be sure of this
 that the kingdom of God has come near.\u2019","I say to you
 it will be more tolerable on that day for Sodom than for that city.","\u201cWoe to you
 Chorazin! Woe to you
 Bethsaida! For if the miracles that occurred in you had occurred in Tyre and Sidon
 they would have repented long ago
 sitting in sackcloth and ashes.","But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you.","And you
 Capernaum
 will not be exalted to heaven
 will you? You will be brought down to Hades!","\u201cThe one who listens to you listens to Me
 and the one who rejects you rejects Me; but the one who rejects Me rejects the One who sent Me.\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cI watched Satan fall from heaven like lightning.","Behold
 I have given you authority to walk on snakes and scorpions
 and authority over all the power of the enemy
 and nothing will injure you.","Nevertheless
 do not rejoice in this
 that the spirits are subject to you
 but rejoice that your names are recorded in heaven.\u201d","At that very time He rejoiced greatly in the Holy Spirit
 and said
 \u201cI praise You
 Father
 Lord of heaven and earth
 that You have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to infants. Yes
 Father
 for doing so was well pleasing in Your sight.","All things have been handed over to Me by My Father
 and no one knows who the Son is except the Father
 and who the Father is except the Son
 and anyone to whom the Son determines to reveal Him.\u201d","Turning to the disciples
 He said privately
 \u201cBlessed are the eyes that see the things you see;","for I tell you that many prophets and kings wanted to see the things that you see
 and did not see them
 and to hear the things that you hear
 and did not hear them.\u201d","And behold
 a lawyer stood up and put Him to the test
 saying
 \u201cTeacher
 what shall I do to inherit eternal life?\u201d","And He said to him
 \u201cWhat is written in the Law? How does it read to you?\u201d","And He said to him
 \u201cYou have answered correctly; do this and you will live.\u201d","Jesus replied and said
 \u201cA man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho
 and he encountered robbers
 and they stripped him and beat him
 and went away leaving him half dead.","And by coincidence a priest was going down on that road
 and when he saw him
 he passed by on the other side.","Likewise a Levite also
 when he came to the place and saw him
 passed by on the other side.","But a Samaritan who was on a journey came upon him; and when he saw him
 he felt compassion
","and came to him and bandaged up his wounds
 pouring oil and wine on them; and he put him on his own animal
 and brought him to an inn and took care of him.","On the next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper and said
 \u2018Take care of him; and whatever more you spend
 when I return
 I will repay you.\u2019","Which of these three do you think proved to be a neighbor to the man who fell into the robbers\u2019 hands?\u201d","And he said
 \u201cThe one who showed compassion to him.\u201d Then Jesus said to him
 \u201cGo and do the same.\u201d","But the Lord answered and said to her
 \u201cMartha
 Martha
 you are worried and distracted by many things;","but only one thing is necessary; for Mary has chosen the good part
 which shall not be taken away from her.\u201d","It happened that while Jesus was praying in a certain place
 when He had finished
 one of His disciples said to Him
 \u201cLord
 teach us to pray
 just as John also taught his disciples.\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cWhen you pray
 say: \u2018Father
 hallowed be Your name. Your kingdom come.","Give us each day our daily bread.","And forgive us our sins
 For we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us. And do not lead us into temptation.\u2019\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cSuppose one of you has a friend
 and goes to him at midnight and says to him
 \u2018Friend
 lend me three loaves
","because a friend of mine has come to me from a journey and I have nothing to serve him\u2019;","and from inside he answers and says
 \u2018Do not bother me; the door has already been shut and my children and I are in bed; I cannot get up and give you anything.\u2019","I tell you
 even if he will not get up and give him anything just because he is his friend
 yet because of his shamelessness he will get up and give him as much as he needs.","\u201cSo I say to you
 ask
 and it will be given to you; seek
 and you will find; knock
 and it will be opened to you.","For everyone who asks receives
 and the one who seeks finds
 and to the one who knocks
 it will be opened.","Now which one of you fathers will his son ask for a fish
 and instead of a fish
 he will give him a snake?","Or he will even ask for an egg
 and his father will give him a scorpion?","So if you
 despite being evil
 know how to give good gifts to your children
 how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him?\u201d","And He was casting out a mute demon; when the demon had gone out
 the man who was previously unable to speak talked
 and the crowds were amazed.","But He knew their thoughts and said to them
 \u201cEvery kingdom divided against itself is laid waste; and a house divided against itself falls.","And if Satan also has been divided against himself
 how will his kingdom stand? For you claim that I cast out the demons by Beelzebul.","Yet if by Beelzebul I cast out the demons
 by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore
 they will be your judges.","But if I cast out the demons by the finger of God
 then the kingdom of God has come upon you.","When a strong man
 fully armed
 guards his own house
 his possessions are secure.","But when someone stronger than he attacks him and overpowers him
 that man takes away his armor on which he had relied and distributes his plunder.","The one who is not with Me is against Me; and the one who does not gather with Me scatters.","\u201cWhen the unclean spirit comes out of a person
 it passes through waterless places seeking rest
 and not finding any
 it then says
 \u2018I will return to my house from which I came.\u2019","And when it comes
 it finds it swept and put in order.","Then it goes and brings along seven other spirits more evil than itself
 and they come in and live there; and the last condition of that person becomes worse than the first.\u201d","While Jesus was saying these things
 one of the women in the crowd raised her voice and said to Him
 \u201cBlessed is the womb that carried You
 and the breasts at which You nursed!\u201d","But He said
 \u201cOn the contrary
 blessed are those who hear the word of God and follow it.\u201d","Now as the crowds were increasing
 He began to say
 \u201cThis generation is a wicked generation; it demands a sign
 and so no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah.","For just as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites
 so will the Son of Man be to this generation.","The Queen of the South will rise up with the men of this generation at the judgment and condemn them
 because she came from the ends of the earth to listen to the wisdom of Solomon; and behold
 something greater than Solomon is here.","The men of Nineveh will stand up with this generation at the judgment and condemn it
 because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold
 something greater than Jonah is here.","\u201cNo one lights a lamp and puts it away in a cellar nor under a basket
 but on the lampstand
 so that those who enter may see the light.","Your eye is the lamp of your body; when your eye is clear
 your whole body also is full of light; but when it is bad
 your body also is full of darkness.","So watch out that the light in you is not darkness.","Therefore if your whole body is full of light
 without any dark part
 it will be wholly illuminated
 as when the lamp illuminates you with its light.\u201d","But the Lord said to him
 \u201cNow you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and of the dish; but your inside is full of greed and wickedness.","You foolish ones
 did He who made the outside not make the inside also?","But give that which is within as a charitable gift
 and then all things are clean for you.","\u201cBut woe to you Pharisees! For you pay tithes of mint
 rue
 and every kind of garden herb
 and yet you ignore justice and the love of God; but these are the things you should have done without neglecting the others.","Woe to you Pharisees! For you love the seat of honor in the synagogues and personal greetings in the marketplaces.","Woe to you! For you are like unseen tombs
 and the people who walk over them are unaware of it.\u201d","But He said
 \u201cWoe to you lawyers as well! For you load people with burdens that are hard to bear
 while you yourselves will not even touch the burdens with one of your fingers.","Woe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets
 and it was your fathers who killed them.","So you are witnesses and you approve of the deeds of your fathers; because it was they who killed them
 and you build their tombs.","For this reason also
 the wisdom of God said
 \u2018I will send them prophets and apostles
 and some of them they will kill
 and some they will persecute
","so that the blood of all the prophets
 shed since the foundation of the world
 may be charged against this generation
","from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah
 who was killed between the altar and the house of God; yes
 I tell you
 it shall be charged against this generation.\u2019","Woe to you lawyers! For you have taken away the key of knowledge; you yourselves did not enter
 and you hindered those who were entering.\u201d","Under these circumstances
 after so many thousands of people had gathered together that they were stepping on one another
 He began saying to His disciples first of all
 \u201cBeware of the leaven of the Pharisees
 which is hypocrisy.","But there is nothing covered up that will not be revealed
 and hidden that will not be known.","Accordingly
 whatever you have said in the dark will be heard in the light
 and what you have whispered in the inner rooms will be proclaimed on the housetops.","\u201cNow I say to you
 My friends
 do not be afraid of those who kill the body
 and after that have nothing more that they can do.","But I will warn you whom to fear: fear the One who
 after He has killed someone
 has the power to throw that person into hell; yes
 I tell you
 fear Him!","Are five sparrows not sold for two assaria? And yet not one of them has gone unnoticed in the sight of God.","But even the hairs of your head are all counted. Do not fear; you are more valuable than a great number of sparrows.","\u201cNow I say to you
 everyone who confesses Me before people
 the Son of Man will also confess him before the angels of God;","but the one who denies Me before people will be denied before the angels of God.","And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man
 it will be forgiven him; but the one who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit
 it will not be forgiven him.","Now when they bring you before the synagogues and the officials and the authorities
 do not worry about how or what you are to speak in your defense
 or what you are to say;","for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour what you ought to say.\u201d","But He said to him
 \u201cYou there\u2014who appointed Me a judge or arbitrator over the two of you?\u201d","But He said to them
 \u201cBeware
 and be on your guard against every form of greed; for not even when one is affluent does his life consist of his possessions.\u201d","And He told them a parable
 saying
 \u201cThe land of a rich man was very productive.","And he began thinking to himself
 saying
 \u2018What shall I do
 since I have no place to store my crops?\u2019","And he said
 \u2018This is what I will do: I will tear down my barns and build larger ones
 and I will store all my grain and my goods there.","And I will say to myself
 \u201cYou have many goods stored up for many years to come; relax
 eat
 drink
 and enjoy yourself!\u201d\u2019","But God said to him
 \u2018You fool! This very night your soul is demanded of you; and as for all that you have prepared
 who will own it now?\u2019","Such is the one who stores up treasure for himself
 and is not rich in relation to God.\u201d","And He said to His disciples
 \u201cFor this reason I tell you
 do not worry about your life
 as to what you are to eat; nor for your body
 as to what you are to wear.","For life is more than food
 and the body is more than clothing.","Consider the ravens
 that they neither sow nor reap; they have no storeroom nor barn
 and yet God feeds them; how much more valuable you are than the birds!","And which of you by worrying can add a day to his life\u2019s span?","Therefore if you cannot do even a very little thing
 why do you worry about the other things?","Consider the lilies
 how they grow: they neither labor nor spin; but I tell you
 not even Solomon in all his glory clothed himself like one of these.","Now if God so clothes the grass in the field
 which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace
 how much more will He clothe you? You of little faith!","And do not seek what you are to eat and what you are to drink
 and do not keep worrying.","For all these things are what the nations of the world eagerly seek; and your Father knows that you need these things.","But seek His kingdom
 and these things will be provided to you.","Do not be afraid
 little flock
 because your Father has chosen to give you the kingdom.","\u201cSell your possessions and give to charity; make yourselves money belts that do not wear out
 an inexhaustible treasure in heaven
 where no thief comes near nor does a moth destroy.","For where your treasure is
 there your heart will be also.","\u201cBe prepared
 and keep your lamps lit.","You are also to be like people who are waiting for their master when he returns from the wedding feast
 so that they may immediately open the door for him when he comes and knocks.","Blessed are those slaves whom the master will find on the alert when he comes; truly I say to you
 that he will prepare himself to serve
 and have them recline at the table
 and he will come up and serve them.","Whether he comes in the second watch
 or even in the third
 and finds them so
 blessed are those slaves.","\u201cBut be sure of this
 that if the head of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming
 he would not have allowed his house to be broken into.","You too
 be ready; because the Son of Man is coming at an hour that you do not think He will.\u201d","And the Lord said
 \u201cWho then is the faithful and sensible steward
 whom his master will put in charge of his servants
 to give them their rations at the proper time?","Blessed is that slave whom his master finds so doing when he comes.","Truly I say to you that he will put him in charge of all his possessions.","But if that slave says in his heart
 \u2018My master will take a long time to come
\u2019 and he begins to beat the other slaves
 both men and women
 and to eat and drink and get drunk;","then the master of that slave will come on a day that he does not expect
 and at an hour that he does not know
 and will cut him in two
 and assign him a place with the unbelievers.","And that slave who knew his master\u2019s will and did not get ready or act in accordance with his will
 will receive many blows
","but the one who did not know it
 and committed acts deserving of a beating
 will receive only a few blows. From everyone who has been given much
 much will be demanded; and to whom they entrusted much
 of him they will ask all the more.","\u201cI have come to cast fire upon the earth; and how I wish it were already kindled!","But I have a baptism to undergo
 and how distressed I am until it is accomplished!","Do you think that I came to provide peace on earth? No
 I tell you
 but rather division;","for from now on five members in one household will be divided
 three against two and two against three.","They will be divided
 father against son and son against father
 mother against daughter and daughter against mother
 mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.\u201d","And He was also saying to the crowds
 \u201cWhenever you see a cloud rising in the west
 you immediately say
 \u2018A shower is coming
\u2019 and so it turns out.","And whenever you feel a south wind blowing
 you say
 \u2018It will be a hot day
\u2019 and it turns out that way.","You hypocrites! You know how to analyze the appearance of the earth and the sky
 but how is it that you do not know how to analyze this present time?","\u201cAnd why do you not even judge by yourselves what is right?","For when you are going with your accuser to appear before the magistrate
 on the way
 make an effort to settle with him
 so that he does not drag you before the judge
 and the judge hand you over to the officer
 and the officer throw you into prison.","I tell you
 you will not get out of there until you have paid up the very last lepton.\u201d","And Jesus responded and said to them
 \u201cDo you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans just because they have suffered this fate?","No
 I tell you
 but unless you repent
 you will all likewise perish.","Or do you think that those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them were worse offenders than all the other people who live in Jerusalem?","No
 I tell you
 but unless you repent
 you will all likewise perish.\u201d","And He began telling this parable: \u201cA man had a fig tree which had been planted in his vineyard; and he came looking for fruit on it and did not find any.","And he said to the vineyard-keeper
 \u2018Look! For three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree without finding any. Cut it down! Why does it even use up the ground?\u2019","But he answered and said to him
 \u2018Sir
 leave it alone for this year too
 until I dig around it and put in fertilizer;","and if it bears fruit next year
 fine; but if not
 cut it down.\u2019\u201d","When Jesus saw her
 He called her over and said to her
 \u201cWoman
 you are freed from your sickness.\u201d","But the Lord answered him and said
 \u201cYou hypocrites
 does each of you on the Sabbath not untie his ox or donkey from the stall and lead it away to water it?","And this woman
 a daughter of Abraham as she is
 whom Satan has bound for eighteen long years
 should she not have been released from this restraint on the Sabbath day?\u201d","So He was saying
 \u201cWhat is the kingdom of God like
 and to what shall I compare it?","It is like a mustard seed
 which a man took and threw into his own garden; and it grew and became a tree
 and the birds of the sky nested in its branches.\u201d","And again He said
 \u201cTo what shall I compare the kingdom of God?","It is like leaven
 which a woman took and hid in three sata of flour until it was all leavened.\u201d","And someone said to Him
 \u201cLord
 are there just a few who are being saved?\u201d And He said to them
","\u201cStrive to enter through the narrow door; for many
 I tell you
 will seek to enter and will not be able.","Once the head of the house gets up and shuts the door
 and you begin standing outside and knocking on the door
 saying
 \u2018Lord
 open up to us!\u2019 and He then will answer and say to you
 \u2018I do not know where you are from.\u2019","Then you will begin saying
 \u2018We ate and drank in Your presence
 and You taught in our streets!\u2019","And yet He will say
 \u2018I do not know where you are from; leave Me
 all you evildoers.\u2019","In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham
 Isaac
 Jacob
 and all the prophets in the kingdom of God
 but yourselves being thrown out.","And they will come from east and west
 and from north and south
 and will recline at the table in the kingdom of God.","And behold
 some are last who will be first
 and some are first who will be last.\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cGo and tell that fox
 \u2018Behold
 I am casting out demons and performing healings today and tomorrow
 and on the third day I reach My goal.\u2019","Nevertheless I must go on My journey today and tomorrow and the next day; for it cannot be that a prophet would perish outside Jerusalem.","Jerusalem
 Jerusalem
 the city that kills the prophets and stones those who have been sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together
 just as a hen gathers her young under her wings
 and you were unwilling!","Behold
 your house is left to you desolate; and I say to you
 you will not see Me until you say
 \u2018Blessed is the One who comes in the name of the Lord!\u2019\u201d","And Jesus responded and said to the lawyers and Pharisees
 \u201cIs it lawful to heal on the Sabbath
 or not?\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cWhich one of you will have a son or an ox fall into a well
 and will not immediately pull him out on a Sabbath day?\u201d","\u201cWhenever you are invited by someone to a wedding feast
 do not take the place of honor
 for someone more distinguished than you may have been invited by him
","and the one who invited you both will come and say to you
 \u2018Give your place to this person
\u2019 and then in disgrace you will proceed to occupy the last place.","But whenever you are invited
 go and take the last place
 so that when the one who has invited you comes
 he will say to you
 \u2018Friend
 move up higher\u2019; then you will have honor in the sight of all who are dining at the table with you.","For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled
 and the one who humbles himself will be exalted.\u201d","Now He also went on to say to the one who had invited Him
 \u201cWhenever you give a luncheon or a dinner
 do not invite your friends
 your brothers
 your relatives
 nor wealthy neighbors
 otherwise they may also invite you to a meal in return
 and that will be your repayment.","But whenever you give a banquet
 invite people who are poor
 who have disabilities
 who are limping
 and people who are blind;","and you will be blessed
 since they do not have the means to repay you; for you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.\u201d","Now when one of those who were reclining at the table with Him heard this
 he said to Him
 \u201cBlessed is everyone who will eat bread in the kingdom of God!\u201d","But He said to him
 \u201cA man was giving a big dinner
 and he invited many;","and at the dinner hour he sent his slave to tell those who had been invited
 \u2018Come
 because everything is ready now.\u2019","And yet they all alike began to make excuses. The first one said to him
 \u2018I purchased a field and I need to go out to look at it; please consider me excused.\u2019","And another one said
 \u2018I bought five yoke of oxen
 and I am going to try them out; please consider me excused.\u2019","And another one said
 \u2018I took a woman as my wife
 and for that reason I cannot come.\u2019","And the slave came back and reported this to his master. Then the head of the household became angry and said to his slave
 \u2018Go out at once into the streets and lanes of the city and bring in here those who are poor
 those with disabilities
 those who are blind
 and those who are limping.\u2019","And later the slave said
 \u2018Master
 what you commanded has been done
 and still there is room.\u2019","And the master said to the slave
 \u2018Go out into the roads and the hedges and press upon them to come in
 so that my house will be filled.","For I tell you
 none of those men who were invited shall taste my dinner.\u2019\u201d","Now large crowds were going along with Him
 and He turned and said to them
","\u201cIf anyone comes to Me and does not hate his own father
 mother
 wife
 children
 brothers
 sisters
 yes
 and even his own life
 he cannot be My disciple.","Whoever does not carry his own cross and come after Me cannot be My disciple.","For which one of you
 when he wants to build a tower
 does not first sit down and calculate the cost
 to see if he has enough to complete it?","Otherwise
 when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish
 all who are watching it will begin to ridicule him
","saying
 \u2018This person began to build
 and was not able to finish!\u2019","Or what king
 when he sets out to meet another king in battle
 will not first sit down and consider whether he is strong enough with ten thousand men to face the one coming against him with twenty thousand?","Otherwise
 while the other is still far away
 he sends a delegation and requests terms of peace.","So then
 none of you can be My disciple who does not give up all his own possessions.","\u201cTherefore
 salt is good; but if even salt has become tasteless
 with what will it be seasoned?","It is useless either for the soil or the manure pile
 so it is thrown out. The one who has ears to hear
 let him hear.\u201d","\u201cWhat man among you
 if he has a hundred sheep and has lost one of them
 does not leave the other ninety-nine in the open pasture and go after the one that is lost
 until he finds it?","And when he has found it
 he puts it on his shoulders
 rejoicing.","And when he comes home
 he calls together his friends and his neighbors
 saying to them
 \u2018Rejoice with me
 because I have found my sheep that was lost!\u2019","I tell you that in the same way
 there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous people who have no need of repentance.","\u201cOr what woman
 if she has ten silver coins and loses one coin
 does not light a lamp and sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it?","And when she has found it
 she calls together her friends and neighbors
 saying
 \u2018Rejoice with me
 because I have found the coin which I had lost!\u2019","In the same way
 I tell you
 there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.\u201d","And He said
 \u201cA man had two sons.","The younger of them said to his father
 \u2018Father
 give me the share of the estate that is coming to me.\u2019 And so he divided his wealth between them.","And not many days later
 the younger son gathered everything together and went on a journey to a distant country
 and there he squandered his estate in wild living.","Now when he had spent everything
 a severe famine occurred in that country
 and he began doing without.","So he went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country
 and he sent him into his fields to feed pigs.","And he longed to have his fill of the carob pods that the pigs were eating
 and no one was giving him anything.","But when he came to his senses
 he said
 \u2018How many of my father\u2019s hired laborers have more than enough bread
 but I am dying here from hunger!","I will set out and go to my father
 and will say to him
 \u201cFather
 I have sinned against heaven
 and in your sight;","I am no longer worthy to be called your son; treat me as one of your hired laborers.\u201d\u2019","So he set out and came to his father. But when he was still a long way off
 his father saw him and felt compassion for him
 and ran and embraced him and kissed him.","And the son said to him
 \u2018Father
 I have sinned against heaven and in your sight; I am no longer worthy to be called your son.\u2019","But the father said to his slaves
 \u2018Quickly bring out the best robe and put it on him
 and put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet;","and bring the fattened calf
 slaughter it
 and let\u2019s eat and celebrate;","for this son of mine was dead and has come to life again; he was lost and has been found.\u2019 And they began to celebrate.","\u201cNow his older son was in the field
 and when he came and approached the house
 he heard music and dancing.","And he summoned one of the servants and began inquiring what these things could be.","And he said to him
 \u2018Your brother has come
 and your father has slaughtered the fattened calf because he has received him back safe and sound.\u2019","But he became angry and was not willing to go in; and his father came out and began pleading with him.","But he answered and said to his father
 \u2018Look! For so many years I have been serving you and I have never neglected a command of yours; and yet you never gave me a young goat
 so that I might celebrate with my friends;","but when this son of yours came
 who has devoured your wealth with prostitutes
 you slaughtered the fattened calf for him.\u2019","And he said to him
 \u2018Son
 you have always been with me
 and all that is mine is yours.","But we had to celebrate and rejoice
 because this brother of yours was dead and has begun to live
 and was lost and has been found.\u2019\u201d","Now He was also saying to the disciples
 \u201cThere was a rich man who had a manager
 and this manager was reported to him as squandering his possessions.","And he summoned him and said to him
 \u2018What is this I hear about you? Give an accounting of your management
 for you can no longer be manager.\u2019","And the manager said to himself
 \u2018What am I to do
 since my master is taking the management away from me? I am not strong enough to dig; I am ashamed to beg.","I know what I will do
 so that when I am removed from the management people will welcome me into their homes.\u2019","And he summoned each one of his master\u2019s debtors
 and he began saying to the first
 \u2018How much do you owe my master?\u2019","And he said
 \u2018A hundred jugs of oil.\u2019 And he said to him
 \u2018Take your bill
 and sit down quickly and write fifty.\u2019","Then he said to another
 \u2018And how much do you owe?\u2019 And he said
 \u2018A hundred kors of wheat.\u2019 He *said to him
 \u2018Take your bill
 and write eighty.\u2019","And his master complimented the unrighteous manager because he had acted shrewdly; for the sons of this age are more shrewd in relation to their own kind than the sons of light.","And I say to you
 make friends for yourselves by means of the wealth of unrighteousness
 so that when it is all gone
 they will receive you into the eternal dwellings.","\u201cThe one who is faithful in a very little thing is also faithful in much; and the one who is unrighteous in a very little thing is also unrighteous in much.","Therefore if you have not been faithful in the use of unrighteous wealth
 who will entrust the true wealth to you?","And if you have not been faithful in the use of that which is another\u2019s
 who will give you that which is your own?","No servant can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other
 or he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth.\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cYou are the ones who justify yourselves in the sight of people
 but God knows your hearts; because that which is highly esteemed among people is detestable in the sight of God.","\u201cThe Law and the Prophets were proclaimed until John came; since that time the gospel of the kingdom of God has been preached
 and everyone is forcing his way into it.","But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one stroke of a letter of the Law to fail.","\u201cEveryone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery
 and he who marries one who is divorced from a husband commits adultery.","\u201cNow there was a rich man
 and he habitually dressed in purple and fine linen
 enjoying himself in splendor every day.","And a poor man named Lazarus was laid at his gate
 covered with sores
","and longing to be fed from the scraps which fell from the rich man\u2019s table; not only that
 the dogs also were coming and licking his sores.","Now it happened that the poor man died and was carried away by the angels to Abraham\u2019s arms; and the rich man also died and was buried.","And in Hades he raised his eyes
 being in torment
 and *saw Abraham far away and Lazarus in his arms.","And he cried out and said
 \u2018Father Abraham
 have mercy on me and send Lazarus
 so that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool off my tongue
 for I am in agony in this flame.\u2019","But Abraham said
 \u2018Child
 remember that during your life you received your good things
 and likewise Lazarus bad things; but now he is being comforted here
 and you are in agony.","And besides all this
 between us and you a great chasm has been set
 so that those who want to go over from here to you will not be able
 nor will any people cross over from there to us.\u2019","And he said
 \u2018Then I request of you
 father
 that you send him to my father\u2019s house\u2014","for I have five brothers\u2014in order that he may warn them
 so that they will not come to this place of torment as well.\u2019","But Abraham *said
 \u2018They have Moses and the Prophets; let them hear them.\u2019","But he said
 \u2018No
 father Abraham
 but if someone goes to them from the dead
 they will repent!\u2019","But he said to him
 \u2018If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets
 they will not be persuaded even if someone rises from the dead.\u2019\u201d","Now He said to His disciples
 \u201cIt is inevitable that stumbling blocks come
 but woe to one through whom they come!","It is better for him if a millstone is hung around his neck and he is thrown into the sea
 than that he may cause one of these little ones to sin.","Be on your guard! If your brother sins
 rebuke him; and if he repents
 forgive him.","And if he sins against you seven times a day
 and returns to you seven times
 saying
 \u2018I repent
\u2019 you shall forgive him.\u201d","But the Lord said
 \u201cIf you had faith the size of a mustard seed
 you could say to this mulberry tree
 \u2018Be uprooted and be planted in the sea\u2019; and it would obey you.","\u201cNow which of you
 having a slave plowing or tending sheep
 will say to him after he comes in from the field
 \u2018Come immediately and recline at the table to eat\u2019?","On the contrary
 will he not say to him
 \u2018Prepare something for me to eat
 and properly clothe yourself and serve me while I eat and drink; and afterward you may eat and drink\u2019?","He does not thank the slave because he did the things which were commanded
 does he?","So you too
 when you do all the things which were commanded you
 say
 \u2018We are unworthy slaves; we have done only that which we ought to have done.\u2019\u201d","While He was on the way to Jerusalem
 He was passing between Samaria and Galilee.","When He saw them
 He said to them
 \u201cGo and show yourselves to the priests.\u201d And as they were going
 they were cleansed.","But Jesus responded and said
 \u201cWere there not ten cleansed? But the nine\u2014where are they?","Was no one found who returned to give glory to God
 except this foreigner?\u201d","And He said to him
 \u201cStand up and go; your faith has made you well.\u201d","Now He was questioned by the Pharisees as to when the kingdom of God was coming
 and He answered them and said
 \u201cThe kingdom of God is not coming with signs that can be observed;","nor will they say
 \u2018Look
 here it is!\u2019 or
 \u2018There it is!\u2019 For behold
 the kingdom of God is in your midst.\u201d","And He said to the disciples
 \u201cThe days will come when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man
 and you will not see it.","And they will say to you
 \u2018Look there
\u2019 or
 \u2018Look here!\u2019 Do not leave
 and do not run after them.","For just like the lightning
 when it flashes out of one part of the sky
 shines to the other part of the sky
 so will the Son of Man be in His day.","But first He must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.","And just as it happened in the days of Noah
 so will it also be in the days of the Son of Man:","people were eating
 they were drinking
 they were marrying
 and they were being given in marriage
 until the day that Noah entered the ark
 and the flood came and destroyed them all.","It was the same as happened in the days of Lot: they were eating
 they were drinking
 they were buying
 they were selling
 they were planting
 and they were building;","but on the day that Lot left Sodom
 it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all.","It will be just the same on the day that the Son of Man is revealed.","On that day
 the one who will be on the housetop
 with his goods in the house
 must not go down to take them out; and likewise the one in the field must not turn back.","Remember Lot\u2019s wife.","Whoever strives to save his life will lose it
 and whoever loses his life will keep it.","I tell you
 on that night there will be two in one bed; one will be taken and the other will be left.","There will be two women grinding at the same place; one will be taken and the other will be left.","And responding
 they *said to Him
 \u201cWhere
 Lord?\u201d And He said to them
 \u201cWhere the body is
 there also the vultures will be gathered.\u201d","saying
 \u201cIn a certain city there was a judge who did not fear God and did not respect any person.","Now there was a widow in that city
 and she kept coming to him
 saying
 \u2018Give me justice against my opponent.\u2019","For a while he was unwilling; but later he said to himself
 \u2018Even though I do not fear God nor respect any person
","yet because this widow is bothering me
 I will give her justice; otherwise by continually coming she will wear me out.\u2019\u201d","And the Lord said
 \u201cListen to what the unrighteous judge *said;","now
 will God not bring about justice for His elect who cry out to Him day and night
 and will He delay long for them?","I tell you that He will bring about justice for them quickly. However
 when the Son of Man comes
 will He find faith on the earth?\u201d","\u201cTwo men went up into the temple to pray
 one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.","The Pharisee stood and began praying this in regard to himself: \u2018God
 I thank You that I am not like other people: swindlers
 crooked
 adulterers
 or even like this tax collector.","I fast twice a week; I pay tithes of all that I get.\u2019","But the tax collector
 standing some distance away
 was even unwilling to raise his eyes toward heaven
 but was beating his chest
 saying
 \u2018God
 be merciful to me
 the sinner!\u2019","I tell you
 this man went to his house justified rather than the other one; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled
 but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.\u201d","But Jesus called for the little ones
 saying
 \u201cAllow the children to come to Me
 and do not forbid them
 for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.","Truly I say to you
 whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child will not enter it at all.\u201d","But Jesus said to him
 \u201cWhy do you call Me good? No one is good except God alone.","You know the commandments
 \u2018Do not commit adultery
 Do not murder
 Do not steal
 Do not give false testimony
 Honor your father and mother.\u2019\u201d","And he said
 \u201cAll these things I have kept since my youth.\u201d","Now when Jesus heard this
 He said to him
 \u201cOne thing you still lack; sell all that you possess and distribute the money to the poor
 and you will have treasure in heaven; and come
 follow Me.\u201d","And Jesus looked at him and said
 \u201cHow hard it is for those who are wealthy to enter the kingdom of God!","For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle
 than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God!\u201d","But He said
 \u201cThe things that are impossible with people are possible with God.\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cTruly I say to you
 there is no one who has left house
 or wife
 or brothers
 or parents
 or children for the sake of the kingdom of God
","who will not receive many times as much at this time
 and in the age to come
 eternal life.\u201d","Now He took the twelve aside and said to them
 \u201cBehold
 we are going up to Jerusalem
 and all the things that have been written through the prophets about the Son of Man will be accomplished.","For He will be handed over to the Gentiles
 and will be ridiculed
 and abused
 and spit upon
","and after they have flogged Him
 they will kill Him; and on the third day He will rise.\u201d","The disciples understood none of these things
 and the meaning of this statement was hidden from them
 and they did not comprehend the things that were said.","\u201cWhat do you want Me to do for you?\u201d And he said
 \u201cLord
 I want to regain my sight!\u201d","And Jesus said to him
 \u201cRegain your sight; your faith has made you well.\u201d","And when Jesus came to the place
 He looked up and said to him
 \u201cZaccheus
 hurry and come down
 for today I must stay at your house.\u201d","But Zaccheus stopped and said to the Lord
 \u201cBehold
 Lord
 half of my possessions I am giving to the poor
 and if I have extorted anything from anyone
 I am giving back four times as much.\u201d","And Jesus said to him
 \u201cToday salvation has come to this house
 because he
 too
 is a son of Abraham.","For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost.\u201d","So He said
 \u201cA nobleman went to a distant country to receive a kingdom for himself
 and then to return.","And he called ten of his own slaves and gave them ten minas
 and said to them
 \u2018Do business with this money until I come back.\u2019","But his citizens hated him and sent a delegation after him
 saying
 \u2018We do not want this man to reign over us.\u2019","When he returned after receiving the kingdom
 he ordered that these slaves
 to whom he had given the money
 be summoned to him so that he would learn how much they had made by the business they had done.","The first slave appeared
 saying
 \u2018Master
 your mina has made ten minas more.\u2019","And he said to him
 \u2018Well done
 good slave; since you have been faithful in a very little thing
 you are to have authority over ten cities.\u2019","The second one came
 saying
 \u2018Your mina
 master
 has made five minas.\u2019","And he said to him also
 \u2018And you are to be over five cities.\u2019","And then another came
 saying
 \u2018Master
 here is your mina
 which I kept tucked away in a handkerchief;","for I was afraid of you
 because you are a demanding man; you take up what you did not lay down
 and reap what you did not sow.\u2019","He *said to him
 \u2018From your own lips I will judge you
 you worthless slave. Did you know that I am a demanding man
 taking up what I did not lay down
 and reaping what I did not sow?","And so why did you not put my money in the bank
 and when I came back
 I would have collected it with interest?\u2019","And then he said to the other slaves who were present
 \u2018Take the mina away from him and give it to the one who has the ten minas.\u2019","And they said to him
 \u2018Master
 he already has ten minas.\u2019","\u2018I tell you that to everyone who has
 more shall be given
 but from the one who does not have
 even what he does have shall be taken away.","But as for these enemies of mine who did not want me to reign over them
 bring them here and slaughter them in my presence.\u2019\u201d","saying
 \u201cGo into the village ahead of you; there
 as you enter
 you will find a colt tied
 on which no one yet has ever sat; untie it and bring it here.","And if anyone asks you
 \u2018Why are you untying it?\u2019 you shall say this: \u2018The Lord has need of it.\u2019\u201d","And yet some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Him
 \u201cTeacher
 rebuke Your disciples!\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cI tell you
 if these stop speaking
 the stones will cry out!\u201d","saying
 \u201cIf you had known on this day
 even you
 the conditions for peace! But now they have been hidden from your eyes.","For the days will come upon you when your enemies will put up a barricade against you
 and surround you and hem you in on every side
","and they will level you to the ground
 and throw down your children within you
 and they will not leave in you one stone upon another
 because you did not recognize the time of your visitation.\u201d","saying to them
 \u201cIt is written: \u2018And My house will be a house of prayer
\u2019 but you have made it a den of robbers.\u201d","But He replied to them
 \u201cI will also ask you a question
 and you tell Me:","Was the baptism of John from heaven or from men?\u201d","And Jesus said to them
 \u201cNeither am I telling you by what authority I do these things.\u201d","But He began to tell the people this parable: \u201cA man planted a vineyard and leased it to vine-growers
 and went on a journey for a long time.","At the harvest time he sent a slave to the vine-growers
 so that they would give him his share of the produce of the vineyard; but the vine-growers beat him and sent him away empty-handed.","And he proceeded to send another slave; but they beat him also and treated him shamefully
 and sent him away empty-handed.","And he proceeded to send a third; but this one too they wounded and threw out.","Now the owner of the vineyard said
 \u2018What am I to do? I will send my beloved son; perhaps they will respect him.\u2019","But when the vine-growers saw him
 they discussed with one another
 saying
 \u2018This is the heir; let\u2019s kill him so that the inheritance will be ours.\u2019","And so they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What
 then
 will the owner of the vineyard do to them?","He will come and put these vine-growers to death
 and will give the vineyard to others.\u201d However
 when they heard this
 they said
 \u201cMay it never happen!\u201d","But Jesus looked at them and said
 \u201cThen what is this statement that has been written: \u2018A stone which the builders rejected
 This has become the chief cornerstone\u2019?","Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces; but on whomever it falls
 it will crush him.\u201d","And so they watched Him closely
 and sent spies who pretended to be righteous
 in order that they might catch Him in some statement
 so that they could hand Him over to the jurisdiction and authority of the governor.","\u201cShow Me a denarius. Whose image and inscription does it have?\u201d They said
 \u201cCaesar\u2019s.\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cThen pay to Caesar the things that are Caesar\u2019s
 and to God the things that are God\u2019s.\u201d","And they were unable to catch Him in a statement in the presence of the people; and they were amazed at His answer
 and said nothing.","Jesus said to them
 \u201cThe sons of this age marry and the women are given in marriage
","but those who are considered worthy to attain to that age and the resurrection from the dead
 neither marry nor are given in marriage;","for they cannot even die anymore
 for they are like angels
 and are sons of God
 being sons of the resurrection.","But as for the fact that the dead are raised
 even Moses revealed this in the passage about the burning bush
 where he calls the Lord the God of Abraham
 the God of Isaac
 and the God of Jacob.","Now He is not the God of the dead
 but of the living; for all live to Him.\u201d","But He said to them
 \u201cHow is it that they say the Christ is David\u2019s son?","For David himself says in the book of Psalms
 \u2018The Lord said to my Lord
 \u201cSit at My right hand
","Until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet.\u201d\u2019","Therefore David calls Him \u2018Lord
\u2019 and so how is He his son?\u201d","\u201cBeware of the scribes
 who like to walk around in long robes
 and love personal greetings in the marketplaces
 and chief seats in the synagogues and places of honor at banquets
","who devour widows\u2019 houses
 and for appearance\u2019s sake offer long prayers. These will receive all the more condemnation.\u201d","And He said
 \u201cTruly I say to you
 this poor widow put in more than all of them;","for they all contributed to the offering from their surplus; but she
 from her poverty
 put in all that she had to live on.\u201d","\u201cAs for these things which you are observing
 the days will come when there will not be left one stone upon another
 which will not be torn down.\u201d","And He said
 \u201cSee to it that you are not misled; for many will come in My name
 saying
 \u2018I am He
\u2019 and
 \u2018The time is near.\u2019 Do not go after them.","And when you hear of wars and revolts
 do not be alarmed; for these things must take place first
 but the end will not follow immediately.\u201d","Then He continued by saying to them
 \u201cNation will rise against nation
 and kingdom against kingdom
","and there will be massive earthquakes
 and in various places plagues and famines; and there will be terrible sights and great signs from heaven.","\u201cBut before all these things
 they will lay their hands on you and persecute you
 turning you over to the synagogues and prisons
 bringing you before kings and governors on account of My name.","It will lead to an opportunity for your testimony.","So make up your minds not to prepare beforehand to defend yourselves;","for I will provide you eloquence and wisdom which none of your adversaries will be able to oppose or refute.","But you will be betrayed even by parents
 brothers and sisters
 other relatives
 and friends
 and they will put some of you to death
","and you will be hated by all people because of My name.","And yet not a hair of your head will perish.","By your endurance you will gain your lives.","\u201cBut when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies
 then recognize that her desolation is near.","Then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains
 and those who are inside the city must leave
 and those who are in the country must not enter the city;","because these are days of punishment
 so that all things which have been written will be fulfilled.","Woe to those women who are pregnant
 and to those who are nursing babies in those days; for there will be great distress upon the land
 and wrath to this people;","and they will fall by the edge of the sword
 and will be led captive into all the nations; and Jerusalem will be trampled underfoot by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.","\u201cThere will be signs in the sun and moon and stars
 and on the earth distress among nations
 in perplexity at the roaring of the sea and the waves
","people fainting from fear and the expectation of the things that are coming upon the world; for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.","And then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.","But when these things begin to take place
 straighten up and lift up your heads
 because your redemption is drawing near.\u201d","And He told them a parable: \u201cLook at the fig tree and all the trees:","as soon as they put forth leaves
 you see for yourselves and know that summer is now near.","So you too
 when you see these things happening
 recognize that the kingdom of God is near.","Truly I say to you
 this generation will not pass away until all things take place.","Heaven and earth will pass away
 but My words will not pass away.","\u201cBut be on your guard
 so that your hearts will not be weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and the worries of life
 and that this day will not come on you suddenly
 like a trap;","for it will come upon all those who live on the face of all the earth.","But stay alert at all times
 praying that you will have strength to escape all these things that are going to take place
 and to stand before the Son of Man.\u201d","And so Jesus sent Peter and John
 saying
 \u201cGo and prepare the Passover for us
 so that we may eat it.\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cWhen you have entered the city
 a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you; follow him into the house that he enters.","And you shall say to the owner of the house
 \u2018The Teacher says to you
 \u201cWhere is the guest room in which I may eat the Passover with My disciples?\u201d\u2019","And he will show you a large
 furnished upstairs room; prepare it there.\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cI have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer;","for I say to you
 I shall not eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.\u201d","And when He had taken a cup and given thanks
 He said
 \u201cTake this and share it among yourselves;","for I say to you
 I will not drink of the fruit of the vine from now on until the kingdom of God comes.\u201d","And when He had taken some bread and given thanks
 He broke it and gave it to them
 saying
 \u201cThis is My body
 which is being given for you; do this in remembrance of Me.\u201d","And in the same way He took the cup after they had eaten
 saying
 \u201cThis cup
 which is poured out for you
 is the new covenant in My blood.","But behold
 the hand of the one betraying Me is with Mine on the table.","For indeed
 the Son of Man is going as it has been determined; but woe to that man by whom He is betrayed!\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cThe kings of the Gentiles domineer over them; and those who have authority over them are called \u2018Benefactors.\u2019","But it is not this way for you; rather
 the one who is the greatest among you must become like the youngest
 and the leader like the servant.","For who is greater
 the one who reclines at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines at the table? But I am among you as the one who serves.","\u201cYou are the ones who have stood by Me in My trials;","and just as My Father has granted Me a kingdom
 I grant you","that you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom
 and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.","\u201cSimon
 Simon
 behold
 Satan has demanded to sift you men like wheat;","but I have prayed for you
 that your faith will not fail; and you
 when you have turned back
 strengthen your brothers.\u201d","But he said to Him
 \u201cLord
 I am ready to go with You both to prison and to death!\u201d","But He said
 \u201cI tell you
 Peter
 the rooster will not crow today until you have denied three times that you know Me.\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cWhen I sent you out without money belt and bag and sandals
 you did not lack anything
 did you?\u201d They said
 \u201cNo
 nothing.\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cBut now
 whoever has a money belt is to take it along
 likewise also a bag
 and whoever has no sword is to sell his cloak and buy one.","For I tell you that this which is written must be fulfilled in Me: \u2018And He was counted with wrongdoers\u2019; for that which refers to Me has its fulfillment.\u201d","They said
 \u201cLord
 look
 here are two swords.\u201d And He said to them
 \u201cIt is enough.\u201d","Now when He arrived at the place
 He said to them
 \u201cPray that you do not come into temptation.\u201d","saying
 \u201cFather
 if You are willing
 remove this cup from Me; yet not My will
 but Yours be done.\u201d","and He said to them
 \u201cWhy are you sleeping? Get up and pray that you do not come into temptation.\u201d","But Jesus said to him
 \u201cJudas
 are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?\u201d","But Jesus responded and said
 \u201cStop! No more of this.\u201d And He touched his ear and healed him.","And Jesus said to the chief priests and officers of the temple and elders who had come against Him
 \u201cHave you come out with swords and clubs as you would against a man inciting a revolt?","While I was with you daily in the temple
 you did not lay hands on Me; but this hour and the power of darkness are yours.\u201d","And then the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord
 how He had told him
 \u201cBefore a rooster crows today
 you will deny Me three times.\u201d","\u201cIf You are the Christ
 tell us.\u201d But He said to them
 \u201cIf I tell you
 you will not believe;","and if I ask a question
 you will not answer.","But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.\u201d","And they all said
 \u201cSo You are the Son of God?\u201d And He said to them
 \u201cYou say correctly that I am.\u201d","Now Pilate asked Him
 saying
 \u201cSo You are the King of the Jews?\u201d And He answered him and said
 \u201cIt is as you say.\u201d","Now when Pilate heard this
 he asked whether the man was a Galilean.","and he said to them
 \u201cYou brought this man to me on the ground that he is inciting the people to revolt; and behold
 after examining Him before you
 I have found no basis at all in the case of this man for the charges which you are bringing against Him.","And he said to them a third time
 \u201cWhy
 what has this man done wrong? I have found in His case no grounds for a sentence of death; therefore I will punish Him and release Him.\u201d","But Jesus turned to them and said
 \u201cDaughters of Jerusalem
 stop weeping for Me
 but weep for yourselves and for your children.","For behold
 days are coming when they will say
 \u2018Blessed are those who cannot bear
 and the wombs that have not given birth
 and the breasts that have not nursed.\u2019","Then they will begin to say to the mountains
 \u2018Fall on us
\u2019 and to the hills
 \u2018Cover us.\u2019","For if they do these things when the tree is green
 what will happen when it is dry?\u201d","[But Jesus was saying
 \u201cFather
 forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing.\u201d] And they cast lots
 dividing His garments among themselves.","And He said to him
 \u201cTruly I say to you
 today you will be with Me in Paradise.\u201d","And Jesus
 crying out with a loud voice
 said
 \u201cFather
 into Your hands I entrust My spirit.\u201d And having said this
 He died.","and as the women were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground
 the men said to them
 \u201cWhy are you seeking the living One among the dead?","And He said to them
 \u201cWhat are these words that you are exchanging with one another as you are walking?\u201d And they came to a stop
 looking sad.","And He said to them
 \u201cWhat sort of things?\u201d And they said to Him
 \u201cThose about Jesus the Nazarene
 who proved to be a prophet mighty in deed and word in the sight of God and all the people
","And then He said to them
 \u201cYou foolish men and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!","Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and to come into His glory?\u201d","Now while they were telling these things
 Jesus Himself suddenly stood in their midst and *said to them
 \u201cPeace be to you.\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cWhy are you frightened
 and why are doubts arising in your hearts?","See My hands and My feet
 that it is I Myself; touch Me and see
 because a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you plainly see that I have.\u201d","While they still could not believe it because of their joy and astonishment
 He said to them
 \u201cHave you anything here to eat?\u201d","Now He said to them
 \u201cThese are My words which I spoke to you while I was still with you
 that all the things that are written about Me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled.\u201d","and He said to them
 \u201cSo it is written
 that the Christ would suffer and rise from the dead on the third day
","and that repentance for forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed in His name to all the nations
 beginning from Jerusalem.","You are witnesses of these things.","And behold
 I am sending the promise of My Father upon you; but you are to stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cWhy were you looking for me? Didn\u2019t you know that I must be in my Father\u2019s house?\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cIt is written in the Scriptures: \u2018A person does not live on bread alone.\u2019\u201d","The devil said to Jesus
 \u201cI will give you all these kingdoms and all their power and glory. It has all been given to me
 and I can give it to anyone I wish. ","Jesus answered
 \u201cIt is written in the Scriptures: \u2018You must worship the Lord your God and serve only him.\u2019\u201d","Then the devil led Jesus to Jerusalem and put him on a high place of the Temple. He said to Jesus
 \u201cIf you are the Son of God
 jump down. ","Jesus answered
 \u201cBut it also says in the Scriptures: \u2018Do not test the Lord your God.\u2019\u201d","\u201cThe Lord has put his Spirit in me
 because he appointed me to tell the Good News to the poor. He has sent me to tell the captives they are free and to tell the blind that they can see again. Isaiah 61:1 God sent me to free those who have been treated unfairly Isaiah 58:6","and to announce the time when the Lord will show his kindness.\u201d Isaiah 61:2","He began to say to them
 \u201cWhile you heard these words just now
 they were coming true!\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cI know that you will tell me the old saying: \u2018Doctor
 heal yourself.\u2019 You want to say
 \u2018We heard about the things you did in Capernaum. Do those things here in your own town!\u2019\u201d ","Then Jesus said
 \u201cI tell you the truth
 a prophet is not accepted in his hometown. ","But I tell you the truth
 there were many widows in Israel during the time of Elijah. It did not rain in Israel for three and one-half years
 and there was no food anywhere in the whole country. ","But Elijah was sent to none of those widows
 only to a widow in Zarephath
 a town in Sidon. ","And there were many with skin diseases living in Israel during the time of the prophet Elisha. But none of them were healed
 only Naaman
 who was from the country of Syria.\u201d","They were amazed at his teaching
 because he spoke with authority. ","Jesus commanded the evil spirit
 \u201cBe quiet! Come out of the man!\u201d The evil spirit threw the man down to the ground before all the people and then left the man without hurting him.","Demons came out of many people
 shouting
 \u201cYou are the Son of God.\u201d But Jesus commanded the demons and would not allow them to speak
 because they knew Jesus was the Christ.","But Jesus said to them
 \u201cI must preach about God\u2019s kingdom to other towns
 too. This is why I was sent.\u201d","When Jesus had finished speaking
 he said to Simon
 \u201cTake the boat into deep water
 and put your nets in the water to catch some fish.\u201d","James and John
 the sons of Zebedee
 Simon\u2019s partners. Jesus said to Simon
 \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. From now on you will fish for people.\u201d ","Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man and said
 \u201cI will. Be healed!\u201d Immediately the disease disappeared. ","Then Jesus said
 \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone about this
 but go and show yourself to the priest and offer a gift for your healing
 as Moses commanded. This will show the people what I have done.\u201d","Seeing their faith
 Jesus said
 \u201cFriend
 your sins are forgiven.\u201d","But Jesus knew what they were thinking and said
 \u201cWhy are you thinking these things? ","Which is easier: to say
 \u2018Your sins are forgiven
\u2019 or to say
 \u2018Stand up and walk\u2019? ","But I will prove to you that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.\u201d So Jesus said to the paralyzed man
 \u201cI tell you
 stand up
 take your mat
 and go home.\u201d","After this
 Jesus went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting in the tax collector\u2019s booth. Jesus said to him
 \u201cFollow me!\u201d ","Jesus answered them
 \u201cIt is not the healthy people who need a doctor
 but the sick. ","I have not come to invite good people but sinners to change their hearts and lives.\u201d","They said to Jesus
 \u201cJohn\u2019s followers often fast for a certain time and pray

 which grew a good crop. ","He thought to himself
 \u2018What will I do? I have no place to keep all my crops.\u2019 ","Then he said
 \u2018This is what I will do: I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones
 and there I will store all my grain and other goods. ","Then I can say to myself
 \u201cI have enough good things stored to last for many years. Rest
 eat
 drink
 and enjoy life!\u201d\u2019","\u201cBut God said to him
 \u2018Foolish man! Tonight your life will be taken from you. So who will get those things you have prepared for yourself?\u2019","\u201cThis is how it will be for those who store up things for themselves and are not rich toward God.\u201d","Jesus said to his followers
 \u201cSo I tell you
 don\u2019t worry about the food you need to live
 or about the clothes you need for your body. ","Life is more than food
 and the body is more than clothes. ","Look at the birds. They don\u2019t plant or harvest
 they don\u2019t have storerooms or barns
 but God feeds them. And you are worth much more than birds. ","You cannot add any time to your life by worrying about it.","If you cannot do even the little things
 then why worry about the big things? ","Consider how the lilies grow; they don\u2019t work or make clothes for themselves. But I tell you that even Solomon with his riches was not dressed as beautifully as one of these flowers.","God clothes the grass in the field
 which is alive today but tomorrow is thrown into the fire. So how much more will God clothe you? Don\u2019t have so little faith! ","Don\u2019t always think about what you will eat or what you will drink
 and don\u2019t keep worrying. ","All the people in the world are trying to get these things
 and your Father knows you need them. ","But seek God\u2019s kingdom
 and all your other needs will be met as well.","\u201cDon\u2019t fear
 little flock
 because your Father wants to give you the kingdom. ","Sell your possessions and give to the poor. Get for yourselves purses that will not wear out
 the treasure in heaven that never runs out
 where thieves can\u2019t steal and moths can\u2019t destroy. ","Your heart will be where your treasure is.","\u201cBe dressed
 ready for service
 and have your lamps shining. ","Be like servants who are waiting for their master to come home from a wedding party. When he comes and knocks
 the servants immediately open the door for him. ","They will be blessed when their master comes home
 because he sees that they were watching for him. I tell you the truth
 the master will dress himself to serve and tell the servants to sit at the table
 and he will serve them. ","Those servants will be blessed when he comes in and finds them still waiting
 even if it is midnight or later.","\u201cRemember this: If the owner of the house knew what time a thief was coming
 he would not allow the thief to enter his house. ","So you also must be ready
 because the Son of Man will come at a time when you don\u2019t expect him!\u201d","The Lord said
 \u201cWho is the wise and trusted servant that the master trusts to give the other servants their food at the right time? ","When the master comes and finds the servant doing his work
 the servant will be blessed. ","I tell you the truth
 the master will choose that servant to take care of everything he owns. ","But suppose the servant thinks to himself
 \u2018My master will not come back soon
\u2019 and he begins to beat the other servants
 men and women
 and to eat and drink and get drunk. ","The master will come when that servant is not ready and is not expecting him. Then the master will cut him in pieces and send him away to be with the others who don\u2019t obey.","\u201cThe servant who knows what his master wants but is not ready
 or who does not do what the master wants
 will be beaten with many blows! ","But the servant who does not know what his master wants and does things that should be punished will be beaten with few blows. From everyone who has been given much
 much will be demanded. And from the one trusted with much
 much more will be expected.","\u201cI came to set fire to the world
 and I wish it were already burning! ","I have a baptism to suffer through
 and I feel very troubled until it is over. ","Do you think I came to give peace to the earth? No
 I tell you
 I came to divide it. ","From now on
 a family with five people will be divided
 three against two
 and two against three. ","They will be divided: father against son and son against father
 mother against daughter and daughter against mother
 mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.\u201d","Then Jesus said to the people
 \u201cWhen you see clouds coming up in the west
 you say
 \u2018It\u2019s going to rain
\u2019 and it happens. ","When you feel the wind begin to blow from the south
 you say
 \u2018It will be a hot day
\u2019 and it happens. ","Hypocrites! You know how to understand the appearance of the earth and sky. Why don\u2019t you understand what is happening now?","\u201cWhy can\u2019t you decide for yourselves what is right?","If your enemy is taking you to court
 try hard to settle it on the way. If you don\u2019t

 you will not get out of there until you have paid everything you owe.\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cDo you think this happened to them because they were more sinful than all others from Galilee? ","No
 I tell you. But unless you change your hearts and lives
 you will be destroyed as they were! ","What about those eighteen people who died when the tower of Siloam fell on them? Do you think they were more sinful than all the others who live in Jerusalem?","No
 I tell you. But unless you change your hearts and lives
 you will all be destroyed too!\u201d","Jesus told this story: \u201cA man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard. He came looking for some fruit on the tree
 but he found none. ","So the man said to his gardener
 \u2018I have been looking for fruit on this tree for three years
 but I never find any. Cut it down. Why should it waste the ground?\u2019 ","But the servant answered
 \u2018Master
 let the tree have one more year to produce fruit. Let me dig up the dirt around it and put on some fertilizer. ","If the tree produces fruit next year
 good. But if not
 you can cut it down.\u2019\u201d","When Jesus saw her
 he called her over and said
 \u201cWoman
 you are free from your sickness.\u201d ","The Lord answered

 a daughter of Abraham
 has been held by Satan for eighteen years. Surely it is not wrong for her to be freed from her sickness on a Sabbath day!\u201d ","Then Jesus said
 \u201cWhat is God\u2019s kingdom like? What can I compare it with? ","It is like a mustard seed that a man plants in his garden. The seed grows and becomes a tree
 and the wild birds build nests in its branches.\u201d","Jesus said again
 \u201cWhat can I compare God\u2019s kingdom with? ","It is like yeast that a woman took and hid in a large tub of flour until it made all the dough rise.\u201d","Someone said to Jesus
 \u201cLord
 will only a few people be saved?\u201d Jesus said
 ","\u201cTry hard to enter through the narrow door

 \u2018Come. Everything is ready.\u2019","\u201cBut all the guests made excuses. The first one said
 \u2018I have just bought a field

 \u2018I have just bought five pairs of oxen; I must go and try them. Please excuse me.\u2019 ","A third person said
 \u2018I just got married; I can\u2019t come.\u2019 ","So the servant returned and told his master what had happened. Then the master became angry and said
 \u2018Go at once into the streets and alleys of the town
 and bring in the poor
 the crippled

 \u2018Master
 I did what you commanded

 he happily puts it on his shoulders ","and goes home. He calls to his friends and neighbors and says
 \u2018Be happy with me because I found my lost sheep.\u2019 ","In the same way
 I tell you there is more joy in heaven over one sinner who changes his heart and life
 than over ninety-nine good people who don\u2019t need to change.","\u201cSuppose a woman has ten silver coins
 but loses one. She will light a lamp
 sweep the house

 \u2018Be happy with me because I have found the coin that I lost.\u2019 ","In the same way
 there is joy in the presence of the angels of God when one sinner changes his heart and life.\u201d","Then Jesus said
 \u201cA man had two sons. ","The younger son said to his father
 \u2018Give me my share of the property.\u2019 So the father divided the property between his two sons. ","Then the younger son gathered up all that was his and traveled far away to another country. There he wasted his money in foolish living.","After he had spent everything
 a time came when there was no food anywhere in the country
 and the son was poor and hungry. ","So he got a job with one of the citizens there who sent the son into the fields to feed pigs.","The son was so hungry that he wanted to eat the pods the pigs were eating
 but no one gave him anything. ","When he realized what he was doing
 he thought
 \u2018All of my father\u2019s servants have plenty of food. But I am here
 almost dying with hunger. ","I will leave and return to my father and say to him
 \u201cFather
 I have sinned against God and against you. ","I am no longer worthy to be called your son

 his father saw him and felt sorry for his son. So the father ran to him and hugged and kissed him. ","The son said
 \u2018Father
 I have sinned against God and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.\u2019 ","But the father said to his servants
 \u2018Hurry! Bring the best clothes and put them on him. Also
 put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. ","And get our fat calf and kill it so we can have a feast and celebrate.","My son was dead
 but now he is alive again! He was lost
 but now he is found!\u2019 So they began to celebrate.","\u201cThe older son was in the field
 and as he came closer to the house
 he heard the sound of music and dancing. ","So he called to one of the servants and asked what all this meant.","The servant said
 \u2018Your brother has come back
 and your father killed the fat calf
 because your brother came home safely.\u2019 ","The older son was angry and would not go in to the feast. So his father went out and begged him to come in.","But the older son said to his father
 \u2018I have served you like a slave for many years and have always obeyed your commands. But you never gave me even a young goat to have at a feast with my friends. ","But your other son
 who wasted all your money on prostitutes
 comes home
 and you kill the fat calf for him!\u2019 ","The father said to him
 \u2018Son
 you are always with me

 but now he is alive. He was lost
 but now he is found.\u2019\u201d","Jesus also said to his followers
 \u201cOnce there was a rich man who had a manager to take care of his business. This manager was accused of cheating him. ","So he called the manager in and said to him
 \u2018What is this I hear about you? Give me a report of what you have done with my money
 because you can\u2019t be my manager any longer.\u2019 ","The manager thought to himself
 \u2018What will I do since my master is taking my job away from me? I am not strong enough to dig ditches
 and I am ashamed to beg. ","I know what I\u2019ll do so that when I lose my job people will welcome me into their homes.\u2019","\u201cSo the manager called in everyone who owed the master any money. He asked the first one
 \u2018How much do you owe?\u2019 ","He answered
 \u2018Eight hundred gallons of olive oil.\u2019 The manager said to him
 \u2018Take your bill
 sit down quickly
 and write four hundred gallons.\u2019 ","Then the manager asked another one
 \u2018How much do you owe?\u2019 He answered
 \u2018One thousand bushels of wheat.\u2019 Then the manager said to him
 \u2018Take your bill and write eight hundred bushels.\u2019 ","So
 the master praised the dishonest manager for being clever. Yes
 worldly people are more clever with their own kind than spiritual people are.","\u201cI tell you
 make friends for yourselves using worldly riches so that when those riches are gone
 you will be welcomed in those homes that continue forever. ","Whoever can be trusted with a little can also be trusted with a lot
 and whoever is dishonest with a little is dishonest with a lot. ","If you cannot be trusted with worldly riches
 then who will trust you with true riches? ","And if you cannot be trusted with things that belong to someone else
 who will give you things of your own?","\u201cNo servant can serve two masters. The servant will hate one master and love the other
 or will follow one master and refuse to follow the other. You cannot serve both God and worldly riches.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cYou make yourselves look good in front of people
 but God knows what is really in your hearts. What is important to people is hateful in God\u2019s sight.","\u201cThe law of Moses and the writings of the prophets were preached until John came. Since then the Good News about the kingdom of God is being told
 and everyone tries to enter it by force. ","It would be easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for the smallest part of a letter in the law to be changed.","\u201cIf a man divorces his wife and marries another woman
 he is guilty of adultery
 and the man who marries a divorced woman is also guilty of adultery.\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cThere was a rich man who always dressed in the finest clothes and lived in luxury every day. ","And a very poor man named Lazarus
 whose body was covered with sores
 was laid at the rich man\u2019s gate. ","He wanted to eat only the small pieces of food that fell from the rich man\u2019s table. And the dogs would come and lick his sores.","Later
 Lazarus died
 and the angels carried him to the arms of Abraham. The rich man died
 too

 he was in much pain. The rich man saw Abraham far away with Lazarus at his side. ","He called
 \u2018Father Abraham
 have mercy on me! Send Lazarus to dip his finger in water and cool my tongue

 \u2018Child

 and you are suffering. ","Besides
 there is a big pit between you and us
 so no one can cross over to you
 and no one can leave there and come here.\u2019 ","The rich man said
 \u2018Father
 then please send Lazarus to my father\u2019s house. ","I have five brothers
 and Lazarus could warn them so that they will not come to this place of pain.\u2019 ","But Abraham said
 \u2018They have the law of Moses and the writings of the prophets; let them learn from them.\u2019 ","The rich man said
 \u2018No
 father Abraham! If someone goes to them from the dead
 they would believe and change their hearts and lives.\u2019 ","But Abraham said to him
 \u2018If they will not listen to Moses and the prophets
 they will not listen to someone who comes back from the dead.\u2019\u201d","Jesus said to his followers
 \u201cThings that cause people to sin will happen
 but how terrible for the person who causes them to happen! ","It would be better for you to be thrown into the sea with a large stone around your neck than to cause one of these little ones to sin.","So be careful! \u201cIf another follower sins
 warn him
 and if he is sorry and stops sinning
 forgive him. ","If he sins against you seven times in one day and says that he is sorry each time
 forgive him.\u201d","The Lord said

 you would say to him
 \u2018Prepare something for me to eat. Then get yourself ready and serve me. After I finish eating and drinking
 you can eat.\u2019 ","The servant does not get any special thanks for doing what his master commanded.","It is the same with you. When you have done everything you are told to do

 and they did not realize what was said.","\u201cWhat do you want me to do for you?\u201d He said
 \u201cLord

 \u201cI will give half of my possessions to the poor. And if I have cheated anyone
 I will pay back four times more.\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cSalvation has come to this house today

 \u2018We don\u2019t want this man to be our king.\u2019","\u201cBut the man became king. When he returned home
 he said
 \u2018Call those servants who have my money so I can know how much they earned with it.\u2019","\u201cThe first servant came and said

 \u2018Excellent! You are a good servant. Since I can trust you with small things
 I will let you rule over ten of my cities.\u2019","\u201cThe second servant said
 \u2018Sir
 I earned five coins with your one.\u2019 ","The king said to this servant
 \u2018You can rule over five cities.\u2019","\u201cThen another servant came in and said to the king
 \u2018Sir

 \u2018I will condemn you by your own words

 \u201cThen I won\u2019t tell you what authority I have to do these things.\u201d","Then Jesus told the people this story: \u201cA man planted a vineyard and leased it to some farmers. Then he went away for a long time.","When it was time for the grapes to be picked
 he sent a servant to the farmers to get some of the grapes. But they beat the servant and sent him away empty-handed. ","Then he sent another servant. They beat this servant also
 and showed no respect for him

 \u2018What will I do now? I will send my son whom I love. Maybe they will respect him.\u2019 ","But when the farmers saw the son
 they said to each other
 \u2018This son will inherit the vineyard. If we kill him
 it will be ours.\u2019 ","So the farmers threw the son out of the vineyard and killed him. \u201cWhat will the owner of this vineyard do to them?","He will come and kill those farmers and will give the vineyard to other farmers.\u201d When the people heard this story
 they said
 \u201cLet this never happen!\u201d","But Jesus looked at them and said
 \u201cThen what does this verse mean: \u2018The stone that the builders rejected became the cornerstone\u2019?  Psalm 118:22","Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken
 and the person on whom it falls
 that person will be crushed!\u201d","So they watched Jesus and sent some spies who acted as if they were sincere.

 they became silent.","Jesus said to them
 \u201cOn earth
 people marry and are given to someone to marry. ","But those who will be worthy to be raised from the dead and live again will not marry
 nor will they be given to someone to marry. ","In that life they are like angels and cannot die. They are children of God
 because they have been raised from the dead. ","Even Moses clearly showed that the dead are raised to life. When he wrote about the burning bush

 he was amazed at the commander. Jesus turned to the crowd that was following him. He said

 he felt sorry for her. So he said
 \u201cDon\u2019t cry.\u201d","Then he went up and touched the coffin. Those carrying it stood still. Jesus said

","Blessed is anyone who does not give up their faith because of me.\u201d","So John\u2019s messengers left. Then Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John. He said

 no one more important than John has ever been born. But the least important person in God\u2019s kingdom is more important than John is.\u201d","Jesus went on to say

 he told a story. He said
 ","\u201cA farmer went out to plant his seed. He scattered the seed on the ground. Some fell on a path. People walked on it

 the plants dried up because they had no water. ","Other seed fell among thorns. The thorns grew up with it and crowded out the plants.","Still other seed fell on good soil. It grew up and produced a crop 100 times more than the farmer planted.\u201d When Jesus said this

The seed is God\u2019s message.","The seed on the path stands for God\u2019s message in the hearts of those who hear. But then the devil comes. He takes away the message from their hearts. He does it so they won\u2019t believe. Then they can\u2019t be saved.","The seed on rocky ground stands for those who hear the message and receive it with joy. But they have no roots. They believe for a while. But when they are tested
 they fall away from the faith. ","The seed that fell among thorns stands for those who hear the message. But as they go on their way
 they are choked by life\u2019s worries
 riches and pleasures. So they do not reach full growth. ","But the seed on good soil stands for those with an honest and good heart. Those people hear the message. They keep it in their hearts. They remain faithful and produce a good crop.","\u201cNo one lights a lamp and then hides it in a clay jar or puts it under a bed. Instead

So why worry about the rest?","\u201cThink about how the wild flowers grow. They don\u2019t work or make clothing. But here is what I tell you.

 the grass is here only today. Tomorrow it is thrown into the fire. Your faith is so small! ","Don\u2019t spend time thinking about what you will eat or drink. Don\u2019t worry about it.","People who are ungodly run after all those things. Your Father knows that you need them.","But put God\u2019s kingdom first.

 \u201cSuppose a master puts one of his servants in charge of his other servants. The servant\u2019s job is to give them the food they are to receive at the right time.

 \u201cThere was a man who had two sons. ","The younger son spoke to his father. He said
 \u2018Father
 give me my share of the family property.\u2019 So the father divided his property between his two sons.","\u201cNot long after that
 the younger son packed up all he had. Then he left for a country far away. There he wasted his money on wild living. ","He spent everything he had. Then the whole country ran low on food. So the son didn\u2019t have what he needed.","He went to work for someone who lived in that country. That person sent the son to the fields to feed the pigs.","The son wanted to fill his stomach with the food the pigs were eating.

 \u2018How many of my father\u2019s hired servants have more than enough food! But here I am dying from hunger! ","I will get up and go back to my father. I will say to him
 \u201cFather

 \u2018Father
 I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer fit to be called your son.\u2019","\u201cBut the father said to his servants
 \u2018Quick! Bring the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. ","Bring the fattest calf and kill it.

 he heard music and dancing. ","So he called one of the servants. He asked him what was going on.","\u2018Your brother has come home
\u2019 the servant replied. \u2018Your father has killed the fattest calf. He has done this because your brother is back safe and sound.\u2019","\u201cThe older brother became angry. He refused to go in. So his father went out and begged him.","But he answered his father
 \u2018Look! All these years I\u2019ve worked like a slave for you. I have always obeyed your orders. You never gave me even a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends. ","But this son of yours wasted your money with some prostitutes. Now he comes home. And for him you kill the fattest calf!\u2019","\u201c\u2009\u2018My son
\u2019 the father said

 \u201cThere was a rich man who had a manager. Some said that the manager was wasting what the rich man owned. ","So the rich man told him to come in. He asked him
 \u2018What is this I hear about you? Tell me exactly how you have handled what I own. You can\u2019t be my manager any longer.\u2019","\u201cThe manager said to himself
 \u2018What will I do now? My master is taking away my job. I\u2019m not strong enough to dig. And I\u2019m too ashamed to beg. ","I know what I\u2019m going to do. I\u2019ll do something so that when I lose my job here
 people will welcome me into their houses.\u2019","\u201cSo he called in each person who owed his master something. He asked the first one
 \u2018How much do you owe my master?\u2019","\u201c\u2009\u2018I owe 900 gallons of olive oil
\u2019 he replied. \u201cThe manager told him
 \u2018Take your bill. Sit down quickly and change it to 450 gallons.\u2019","\u201cThen he asked the second one
 \u2018And how much do you owe?\u2019 \u201c\u2009\u2018I owe 1
000 bushels of wheat

 \u2018Take your bill and change it to 800 bushels.\u2019","\u201cThe manager had not been honest. But the master praised him for being clever. The people of this world are clever in dealing with those who are like themselves. They are more clever than God\u2019s people.","I tell you
 use the riches of this world to help others. In that way
 you will make friends for yourselves. Then when your riches are gone
 you will be welcomed into your eternal home in heaven.","\u201cSuppose you can be trusted with something very little. Then you can also be trusted with something very large.

Then who will trust you with true riches?","Suppose you have not been worthy of trust in handling someone else\u2019s property. Then who will give you property of your own?","\u201cNo one can serve two masters at the same time. Either you will hate one of them and love the other. Or you will be faithful to one and dislike the other. You can\u2019t serve God and money at the same time.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cYou try to make yourselves look good in the eyes of other people. But God knows your hearts. What people think is worth a lot is hated by God.","\u201cThe teachings of the Law and the Prophets were preached until John the Baptist came. Since then
 the good news of God\u2019s kingdom is being preached. And everyone is trying very hard to enter it. ","It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the smallest part of a letter to drop out of the Law.","\u201cAnyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery. Also
 the man who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.","\u201cOnce there was a rich man. He was dressed in purple cloth and fine linen. He lived an easy life every day.","A man named Lazarus was placed at his gate. Lazarus was a beggar. His body was covered with sores.","Even dogs came and licked his sores.

 the rich man was suffering terribly. He looked up and saw Abraham far away. Lazarus was by his side. ","So the rich man called out
 \u2018Father Abraham! Have pity on me! Send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water. Then he can cool my tongue with it. I am in terrible pain in this fire.\u2019","\u201cBut Abraham replied
 \u2018Son

 \u2018Then I beg you

 \u2018They do not listen to Moses and the Prophets. So they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.\u2019\u2009\u201d","Jesus spoke to his disciples. \u201cThings that make people sin are sure to come

 \u2018Don\u2019t be afraid; from now on you will fish for people.\u2019 ","Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. \u2018I am willing
\u2019 he said. \u2018Be clean!\u2019 And immediately the leprosy left him.","Then Jesus ordered him
 \u2018Don\u2019t tell anyone
 but go
 show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing
 as a testimony to them.\u2019","When Jesus saw their faith
 he said
 \u2018Friend
 your sins are forgiven.\u2019","Jesus knew what they were thinking and asked
 \u2018Why are you thinking these things in your hearts? ","Which is easier: to say
 \u201cYour sins are forgiven
\u201d or to say
 \u201cGet up and walk\u201d? ","But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.\u2019 So he said to the paralysed man
 \u2018I tell you
 get up
 take your mat and go home.\u2019 ","After this
 Jesus went out and saw a tax collector by the name of Levi sitting at his tax booth. \u2018Follow me
\u2019 Jesus said to him
 ","Jesus answered them
 \u2018It is not the healthy who need a doctor
 but those who are ill. ","I have not come to call the righteous
 but sinners to repentance.\u2019","They said to him
 \u2018John\u2019s disciples often fast and pray
 and so do the disciples of the Pharisees
 but yours go on eating and drinking.\u2019","Jesus answered
 \u2018Can you make the friends of the bridegroom fast while he is with them? ","But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; in those days they will fast.\u2019","He told them this parable: \u2018No one tears a piece out of a new garment to patch an old one. Otherwise
 they will have torn the new garment
 and the patch from the new will not match the old. ","And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise
 the new wine will burst the skins; the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined. ","No
 new wine must be poured into new wineskins. ","And no one after drinking old wine wants the new
 for they say
 \u201cThe old is better.\u201d\u2019","Jesus answered them
 \u2018Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry? ","He entered the house of God
 and taking the consecrated bread
 he ate what is lawful only for priests to eat. And he also gave some to his companions.\u2019 ","Then Jesus said to them
 \u2018The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.\u2019","But Jesus knew what they were thinking and said to the man with the shrivelled hand
 \u2018Get up and stand in front of everyone.\u2019 So he got up and stood there.","Then Jesus said to them
 \u2018I ask you
 which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil
 to save life or to destroy it?\u2019","He looked round at them all
 and then said to the man
 \u2018Stretch out your hand.\u2019 He did so
 and his hand was completely restored. ","Blessed are you who hunger now
 for you will be satisfied. Blessed are you who weep now
 for you will laugh.","Blessed are you when people hate you
 when they exclude you and insult you and reject your name as evil
 because of the Son of Man.","\u2018Rejoice in that day and leap for joy
 because great is your reward in heaven. For that is how their ancestors treated the prophets.","\u2018But woe to you who are rich
 for you have already received your comfort.","Woe to you who are well fed now
 for you will go hungry. Woe to you who laugh now
 for you will mourn and weep.","Woe to you when everyone speaks well of you
 for that is how their ancestors treated the false prophets.","\u2018But to you who are listening I say: love your enemies
 do good to those who hate you
 ","bless those who curse you
 pray for those who ill-treat you. ","If someone slaps you on one cheek
 turn to them the other also. If someone takes your coat
 do not withhold your shirt from them. ","Give to everyone who asks you
 and if anyone takes what belongs to you
 do not demand it back. ","Do to others as you would have them do to you.","\u2018If you love those who love you
 what credit is that to you? Even sinners love those who love them. ","And if you do good to those who are good to you
 what credit is that to you? Even sinners do that. ","And if you lend to those from whom you expect repayment
 what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners
 expecting to be repaid in full. ","But love your enemies
 do good to them
 and lend to them without expecting to get anything back. Then your reward will be great
 and you will be children of the Most High
 because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked. ","Be merciful
 just as your Father is merciful.","\u2018Do not judge
 and you will not be judged. Do not condemn
 and you will not be condemned. Forgive
 and you will be forgiven. ","Give
 and it will be given to you. A good measure
 pressed down
 shaken together and running over
 will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use
 it will be measured to you.\u2019","He also told them this parable: \u2018Can the blind lead the blind? Will they not both fall into a pit?","The student is not above the teacher
 but everyone who is fully trained will be like their teacher.","\u2018Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother\u2019s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?","How can you say to your brother
 \u201cBrother
 let me take the speck out of your eye
\u201d when you yourself fail to see the plank in your own eye? You hypocrite
 first take the plank out of your eye
 and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother\u2019s eye.","\u2018No good tree bears bad fruit
 nor does a bad tree bear good fruit. ","Each tree is recognised by its own fruit. People do not pick figs from thorn-bushes
 or grapes from briers. ","A good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart
 and an evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart. For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of.","\u2018Why do you call me
 \u201cLord
 Lord
\u201d and do not do what I say? ","As for everyone who comes to me and hears my words and puts them into practice
 I will show you what they are like. ","They are like a man building a house
 who dug down deep and laid the foundation on rock. When the flood came
 the torrent struck that house but could not shake it
 because it was well built. ","But the one who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation. The moment the torrent struck that house
 it collapsed and its destruction was complete.\u2019","When Jesus heard this
 he was amazed at him
 and turning to the crowd following him
 he said
 \u2018I tell you
 I have not found such great faith even in Israel.\u2019 ","When the Lord saw her
 his heart went out to her and he said
 \u2018Don\u2019t cry.\u2019","Then he went up and touched the bier they were carrying him on
 and the bearers stood still. He said
 \u2018Young man
 I say to you
 get up!\u2019 ","So he replied to the messengers
 \u2018Go back and report to John what you have seen and heard: the blind receive sight
 the lame walk
 those who have leprosy are cleansed
 the deaf hear
 the dead are raised
 and the good news is proclaimed to the poor. ","Blessed is anyone who does not stumble on account of me.\u2019","After John\u2019s messengers left
 Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: \u2018What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind? ","If not
 what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No
 those who wear expensive clothes and indulge in luxury are in palaces. ","But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes
 I tell you
 and more than a prophet. ","This is the one about whom it is written: \u2018\u201cI will send my messenger ahead of you
 who will prepare your way before you.\u201d","I tell you
 among those born of women there is no one greater than John; yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.\u2019","Jesus went on to say
 \u2018To what
 then
 can I compare the people of this generation? What are they like? ","They are like children sitting in the market-place and calling out to each other: \u2018\u201cWe played the pipe for you
 and you did not dance; we sang a dirge
 and you did not cry.\u201d","For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine
 and you say
 \u201cHe has a demon.\u201d ","The Son of Man came eating and drinking
 and you say
 \u201cHere is a glutton and a drunkard
 a friend of tax collectors and sinners.\u201d ","But wisdom is proved right by all her children.\u2019","When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this
 he said to himself
 \u2018If this man were a prophet
 he would know who is touching him and what kind of woman she is \u2013 that she is a sinner.\u2019","Jesus answered him
 \u2018Simon
 I have something to tell you.\u2019 \u2018Tell me
 teacher
\u2019 he said.","\u2018Two people owed money to a certain money-lender. One owed him five hundred denarii
 and the other fifty. ","Neither of them had the money to pay him back
 so he forgave the debts of both. Now which of them will love him more?\u2019","Simon replied
 \u2018I suppose the one who had the bigger debt forgiven.\u2019 \u2018You have judged correctly
\u2019 Jesus said.","Then he turned towards the woman and said to Simon
 \u2018Do you see this woman? I came into your house. You did not give me any water for my feet
 but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. ","You did not give me a kiss
 but this woman
 from the time I entered
 has not stopped kissing my feet. ","You did not put oil on my head
 but she has poured perfume on my feet. ","Therefore
 I tell you
 her many sins have been forgiven \u2013 as her great love has shown. But whoever has been forgiven little loves little.\u2019","Then Jesus said to her
 \u2018Your sins are forgiven.\u2019","Jesus said to the woman
 \u2018Your faith has saved you; go in peace.\u2019","While a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from town after town
 he told this parable: ","\u2018A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed
 some fell along the path; it was trampled on
 and the birds ate it up. ","Some fell on rocky ground
 and when it came up
 the plants withered because they had no moisture. ","Other seed fell among thorns
 which grew up with it and choked the plants. ","Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up and yielded a crop
 a hundred times more than was sown.\u2019 When he said this
 he called out
 \u2018Whoever has ears to hear
 let them hear.\u2019","He said
 \u2018The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of God has been given to you
 but to others I speak in parables
 so that
 \u2018\u201cthough seeing
 they may not see; though hearing
 they may not understand.\u201d","\u2018This is the meaning of the parable: the seed is the word of God.","Those along the path are the ones who hear
 and then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts
 so that they may not believe and be saved. ","Those on the rocky ground are the ones who receive the word with joy when they hear it
 but they have no root. They believe for a while
 but in the time of testing they fall away. ","The seed that fell among thorns stands for those who hear
 but as they go on their way they are choked by life\u2019s worries
 riches and pleasures
 and they do not mature. ","But the seed on good soil stands for those with a noble and good heart
 who hear the word
 retain it
 and by persevering produce a crop.","\u2018No one lights a lamp and hides it in a clay jar or puts it under a bed. Instead
 they put it on a stand
 so that those who come in can see the light. ","For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed
 and nothing concealed that will not be known or brought out into the open. ","Therefore consider carefully how you listen. Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have
 even what they think they have will be taken from them.\u2019","Someone told him
 \u2018Your mother and brothers are standing outside
 wanting to see you.\u2019","He replied
 \u2018My mother and brothers are those who hear God\u2019s word and put it into practice.\u2019","One day Jesus said to his disciples
 \u2018Let us go over to the other side of the lake.\u2019 So they got into a boat and set out. ","\u2018Where is your faith?\u2019 he asked his disciples. In fear and amazement they asked one another
 \u2018Who is this? He commands even the winds and the water
 and they obey him.\u2019","Jesus asked him
 \u2018What is your name?\u2019 \u2018Legion
\u2019 he replied
 because many demons had gone into him. ","\u2018Return home and tell how much God has done for you.\u2019 So the man went away and told all over the town how much Jesus had done for him.","\u2018Who touched me?\u2019 Jesus asked. When they all denied it
 Peter said
 \u2018Master
 the people are crowding and pressing against you.\u2019","But Jesus said
 \u2018Someone touched me; I know that power has gone out from me.\u2019","Then he said to her
 \u2018Daughter
 your faith has healed you. Go in peace.\u2019","Hearing this
 Jesus said to Jairus
 \u2018Don\u2019t be afraid; just believe
 and she will be healed.\u2019","Meanwhile
 all the people were wailing and mourning for her. \u2018Stop wailing
\u2019 Jesus said. \u2018She is not dead but asleep.\u2019","But he took her by the hand and said
 \u2018My child
 get up!\u2019 ","He told them: \u2018Take nothing for the journey \u2013 no staff
 no bag
 no bread
 no money
 no extra shirt. ","Whatever house you enter
 stay there until you leave that town. ","If people do not welcome you
 leave their town and shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them.\u2019 ","He replied
 \u2018You give them something to eat.\u2019 They answered
 \u2018We have only five loaves of bread and two fish \u2013 unless we go and buy food for all this crowd.\u2019 ","(About five thousand men were there.) But he said to his disciples
 \u2018Make them sit down in groups of about fifty each.\u2019 ","Once when Jesus was praying in private and his disciples were with him
 he asked them
 \u2018Who do the crowds say I am?\u2019","\u2018But what about you?\u2019 he asked. \u2018Who do you say I am?\u2019 Peter answered
 \u2018God\u2019s Messiah.\u2019","And he said
 \u2018The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders
 the chief priests and the teachers of the law
 and he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life.\u2019","Then he said to them all: \u2018Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross daily and follow me.","For whoever wants to save their life will lose it
 but whoever loses their life for me will save it. ","What good is it for someone to gain the whole world
 and yet lose or forfeit their very self? ","Whoever is ashamed of me and my words
 the Son of Man will be ashamed of them when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.","\u2018Truly I tell you
 some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God.\u2019","As the men were leaving Jesus
 Peter said to him
 \u2018Master
 it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters \u2013 one for you
 one for Moses and one for Elijah.\u2019 (He did not know what he was saying.)","\u2018You unbelieving and perverse generation
\u2019 Jesus replied
 \u2018how long shall I stay with you and put up with you? Bring your son here.\u2019","\u2018Listen carefully to what I am about to tell you: the Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men.\u2019","Then he said to them
 \u2018Whoever welcomes this little child in my name welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me. For it is the one who is least among you all who is the greatest.\u2019","\u2018Do not stop him
\u2019 Jesus said
 \u2018for whoever is not against you is for you.\u2019","Jesus replied
 \u2018Foxes have dens and birds have nests
 but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.\u2019","He said to another man
 \u2018Follow me.\u2019 But he replied
 \u2018Lord
 first let me go and bury my father.\u2019","Jesus said to him
 \u2018Let the dead bury their own dead
 but you go and proclaim the kingdom of God.\u2019","Jesus replied
 \u2018No one who puts a hand to the plough and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God.\u2019","He told them
 \u2018The harvest is plentiful
 but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest
 therefore
 to send out workers into his harvest field. ","Go! I am sending you out like lambs among wolves.","Do not take a purse or bag or sandals; and do not greet anyone on the road.","\u2018When you enter a house
 first say
 \u201cPeace to this house.\u201d ","If someone who promotes peace is there
 your peace will rest on them; if not
 it will return to you. ","Stay there
 eating and drinking whatever they give you
 for the worker deserves his wages. Do not move around from house to house.","\u2018When you enter a town and are welcomed
 eat what is offered to you. ","Heal those there who are ill and tell them
 \u201cThe kingdom of God has come near to you.\u201d ","But when you enter a town and are not welcomed
 go into its streets and say
 ","\u201cEven the dust of your town we wipe from our feet as a warning to you. Yet be sure of this: the kingdom of God has come near.\u201d","I tell you
 it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom than for that town.","\u2018Woe to you
 Chorazin! Woe to you
 Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon
 they would have repented long ago
 sitting in sackcloth and ashes. ","But it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you.","And you
 Capernaum
 will you be lifted to the heavens? No
 you will go down to Hades.","\u2018Whoever listens to you listens to me; whoever rejects you rejects me; but whoever rejects me rejects him who sent me.\u2019","He replied
 \u2018I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven. ","I have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you.","However
 do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you
 but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.\u2019","At that time Jesus
 full of joy through the Holy Spirit
 said
 \u2018I praise you
 Father
 Lord of heaven and earth
 because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned
 and revealed them to little children. Yes
 Father
 for this is what you were pleased to do.","\u2018All things have been committed to me by my Father. No one knows who the Son is except the Father
 and no one knows who the Father is except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.\u2019","Then he turned to his disciples and said privately
 \u2018Blessed are the eyes that see what you see. ","For I tell you that many prophets and kings wanted to see what you see but did not see it
 and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.\u2019","On one occasion an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus. \u2018Teacher
\u2019 he asked
 \u2018what must I do to inherit eternal life?\u2019","\u2018What is written in the Law?\u2019 he replied. \u2018How do you read it?\u2019","\u2018You have answered correctly
\u2019 Jesus replied. \u2018Do this and you will live.\u2019","In reply Jesus said: \u2018A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho
 when he was attacked by robbers. They stripped him of his clothes
 beat him and went away
 leaving him half-dead. ","A priest happened to be going down the same road
 and when he saw the man
 he passed by on the other side. ","So too
 a Levite
 when he came to the place and saw him
 passed by on the other side. ","But a Samaritan
 as he travelled
 came where the man was; and when he saw him
 he took pity on him. ","He went to him and bandaged his wounds
 pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own donkey
 brought him to an inn and took care of him. ","The next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper. \u201cLook after him
\u201d he said
 \u201cand when I return
 I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have.\u201d","\u2018Which of these three do you think was a neighbour to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?\u2019","The expert in the law replied
 \u2018The one who had mercy on him.\u2019 Jesus told him
 \u2018Go and do likewise.\u2019","\u2018Martha
 Martha
\u2019 the Lord answered
 \u2018you are worried and upset about many things
 ","but few things are needed \u2013 or indeed only one. Mary has chosen what is better
 and it will not be taken away from her.\u2019","One day Jesus was praying in a certain place. When he finished
 one of his disciples said to him
 \u2018Lord
 teach us to pray
 just as John taught his disciples.\u2019","He said to them
 \u2018When you pray
 say: \u2018\u201cFather
 hallowed be your name
 your kingdom come.","Give us each day our daily bread.","Forgive us our sins
 for we also forgive everyone who sins against us. And lead us not into temptation.\u201d\u2019","Then Jesus said to them
 \u2018Suppose you have a friend
 and you go to him at midnight and say
 \u201cFriend
 lend me three loaves of bread; ","a friend of mine on a journey has come to me
 and I have no food to offer him.\u201d ","And suppose the one inside answers
 \u201cDon\u2019t bother me. The door is already locked
 and my children and I are in bed. I can\u2019t get up and give you anything.\u201d ","I tell you
 even though he will not get up and give you the bread because of friendship
 yet because of your shameless audacity he will surely get up and give you as much as you need.","\u2018So I say to you: ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.","For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks
 the door will be opened.","\u2018Which of you fathers
 if your son asks for a fish
 will give him a snake instead? ","Or if he asks for an egg
 will give him a scorpion? ","If you then
 though you are evil
 know how to give good gifts to your children
 how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!\u2019","Jesus was driving out a demon that was mute. When the demon left
 the man who had been mute spoke
 and the crowd was amazed. ","Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them: \u2018Any kingdom divided against itself will be ruined
 and a house divided against itself will fall. ","If Satan is divided against himself
 how can his kingdom stand? I say this because you claim that I drive out demons by Beelzebul. ","Now if I drive out demons by Beelzebul
 by whom do your followers drive them out? So then
 they will be your judges. ","But if I drive out demons by the finger of God
 then the kingdom of God has come upon you.","\u2018When a strong man
 fully armed
 guards his own house
 his possessions are safe. ","But when someone stronger attacks and overpowers him
 he takes away the armour in which the man trusted and divides up his plunder.","\u2018Whoever is not with me is against me
 and whoever does not gather with me scatters.","\u2018When an impure spirit comes out of a person
 it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it. Then it says
 \u201cI will return to the house I left.\u201d ","When it arrives
 it finds the house swept clean and put in order. ","Then it goes and takes seven other spirits more wicked than itself
 and they go in and live there. And the final condition of that person is worse than the first.\u2019","As Jesus was saying these things
 a woman in the crowd called out
 \u2018Blessed is the mother who gave you birth and nursed you.\u2019","He replied
 \u2018Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and obey it.\u2019","As the crowds increased
 Jesus said
 \u2018This is a wicked generation. It asks for a sign
 but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah. ","For as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites
 so also will the Son of Man be to this generation. ","The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with the people of this generation and condemn them
 for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomon\u2019s wisdom; and now something greater than Solomon is here. ","The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it
 for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and now something greater than Jonah is here.","\u2018No one lights a lamp and puts it in a place where it will be hidden
 or under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand
 so that those who come in may see the light. ","Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eyes are healthy
 your whole body also is full of light. But when they are unhealthy
 your body also is full of darkness. ","See to it
 then
 that the light within you is not darkness. ","Therefore
 if your whole body is full of light
 and no part of it dark
 it will be just as full of light as when a lamp shines its light on you.\u2019","Then the Lord said to him
 \u2018Now then
 you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and dish
 but inside you are full of greed and wickedness. ","You foolish people! Did not the one who made the outside make the inside also?","But now as for what is inside you \u2013 be generous to the poor
 and everything will be clean for you.","\u2018Woe to you Pharisees

 rue and all other kinds of garden herbs

 because you love the most important seats in the synagogues and respectful greetings in the market-places.","\u2018Woe to you
 because you are like unmarked graves
 which people walk over without knowing it.\u2019","Jesus replied
 \u2018And you experts in the law
 woe to you
 because you load people down with burdens they can hardly carry
 and you yourselves will not lift one finger to help them.","\u2018Woe to you
 because you build tombs for the prophets
 and it was your ancestors who killed them. ","So you testify that you approve of what your ancestors did; they killed the prophets
 and you build their tombs. ","Because of this
 God in his wisdom said
 \u201cI will send them prophets and apostles
 some of whom they will kill and others they will persecute.\u201d ","Therefore this generation will be held responsible for the blood of all the prophets that has been shed since the beginning of the world
 ","from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah

 I tell you

 when a crowd of many thousands had gathered
 so that they were trampling on one another
 Jesus began to speak first to his disciples
 saying: \u2018Be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees
 which is hypocrisy. ","There is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed
 or hidden that will not be made known. ","What you have said in the dark will be heard in the daylight

 my friends
 do not be afraid of those who kill the body and after that can do no more. ","But I will show you whom you should fear: fear him who

 I tell you
 fear him. ","Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? Yet not one of them is forgotten by God.","Indeed
 the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Don\u2019t be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.","\u2018I tell you
 whoever publicly acknowledges me before others
 the Son of Man will also acknowledge before the angels of God. ","But whoever disowns me before others will be disowned before the angels of God.","And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven
 but anyone who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.","\u2018When you are brought before synagogues
 rulers and authorities
 do not worry about how you will defend yourselves or what you will say
 ","for the Holy Spirit will teach you at that time what you should say.\u2019","Jesus replied
 \u2018Man
 who appointed me a judge or an arbiter between you?\u2019 ","Then he said to them
 \u2018Watch out! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; life does not consist in an abundance of possessions.\u2019","And he told them this parable: \u2018The ground of a certain rich man yielded an abundant harvest.","He thought to himself
 \u201cWhat shall I do? I have no place to store my crops.\u201d","\u2018Then he said
 \u201cThis is what I\u2019ll do. I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones
 and there I will store my surplus grain. ","And I\u2019ll say to myself
 \u2018You have plenty of grain laid up for many years. Take life easy; eat
 drink and be merry.\u2019\u201d","\u2018But God said to him
 \u201cYou fool! This very night your life will be demanded from you. Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?\u201d","\u2018This is how it will be with whoever stores up things for themselves but is not rich towards God.\u2019","Then Jesus said to his disciples: \u2018Therefore I tell you
 do not worry about your life
 what you will eat; or about your body
 what you will wear. ","For life is more than food
 and the body more than clothes. ","Consider the ravens: they do not sow or reap
 they have no storeroom or barn; yet God feeds them. And how much more valuable you are than birds! ","Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to your life?","Since you cannot do this very little thing
 why do you worry about the rest?","\u2018Consider how the wild flowers grow. They do not labour or spin. Yet I tell you
 not even Solomon in all his splendour was dressed like one of these. ","If that is how God clothes the grass of the field
 which is here today
 and tomorrow is thrown into the fire
 how much more will he clothe you \u2013 you of little faith! ","And do not set your heart on what you will eat or drink; do not worry about it.","For the pagan world runs after all such things
 and your Father knows that you need them. ","But seek his kingdom
 and these things will be given to you as well.","\u2018Do not be afraid
 little flock
 for your Father has been pleased to give you the kingdom. ","Sell your possessions and give to the poor. Provide purses for yourselves that will not wear out
 a treasure in heaven that will never fail
 where no thief comes near and no moth destroys. ","For where your treasure is
 there your heart will be also.","\u2018Be dressed ready for service and keep your lamps burning
 ","like servants waiting for their master to return from a wedding banquet
 so that when he comes and knocks they can immediately open the door for him. ","It will be good for those servants whose master finds them watching when he comes. Truly I tell you
 he will dress himself to serve
 will make them recline at the table and will come and wait on them. ","It will be good for those servants whose master finds them ready
 even if he comes in the middle of the night or towards daybreak. ","But understand this: if the owner of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming
 he would not have let his house be broken into. ","You also must be ready
 because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him.\u2019","The Lord answered
 \u2018Who then is the faithful and wise manager
 whom the master puts in charge of his servants to give them their food allowance at the proper time? ","It will be good for that servant whom the master finds doing so when he returns.","Truly I tell you
 he will put him in charge of all his possessions. ","But suppose the servant says to himself
 \u201cMy master is taking a long time in coming
\u201d and he then begins to beat the other servants
 both men and women
 and to eat and drink and get drunk. ","The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he is not aware of. He will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the unbelievers.","\u2018The servant who knows the master\u2019s will and does not get ready or does not do what the master wants will be beaten with many blows.","But the one who does not know and does things deserving punishment will be beaten with few blows. From everyone who has been given much
 much will be demanded; and from the one who has been entrusted with much
 much more will be asked.","\u2018I have come to bring fire on the earth
 and how I wish it were already kindled! ","But I have a baptism to undergo
 and what constraint I am under until it is completed! ","Do you think I came to bring peace on earth? No
 I tell you
 but division. ","From now on there will be five in one family divided against each other
 three against two and two against three. ","They will be divided
 father against son and son against father
 mother against daughter and daughter against mother
 mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.\u2019","He said to the crowd: \u2018When you see a cloud rising in the west
 immediately you say
 \u201cIt\u2019s going to rain
\u201d and it does. ","And when the south wind blows
 you say
 \u201cIt\u2019s going to be hot
\u201d and it is. ","Hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky. How is it that you don\u2019t know how to interpret this present time?","\u2018Why don\u2019t you judge for yourselves what is right?","As you are going with your adversary to the magistrate
 try hard to be reconciled on the way
 or your adversary may drag you off to the judge
 and the judge turn you over to the officer
 and the officer throw you into prison. ","I tell you
 you will not get out until you have paid the last penny.\u2019","Jesus answered
 \u2018Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans because they suffered this way? ","I tell you
 no! But unless you repent
 you too will all perish. ","Or those eighteen who died when the tower in Siloam fell on them \u2013 do you think they were more guilty than all the others living in Jerusalem?","I tell you
 no! But unless you repent
 you too will all perish.\u2019","Then he told this parable: \u2018A man had a fig-tree growing in his vineyard
 and he went to look for fruit on it but did not find any. ","So he said to the man who took care of the vineyard
 \u201cFor three years now I\u2019ve been coming to look for fruit on this fig-tree and haven\u2019t found any. Cut it down! Why should it use up the soil?\u201d","\u2018\u201cSir
\u201d the man replied
 \u201cleave it alone for one more year
 and I\u2019ll dig round it and fertilise it. ","If it bears fruit next year
 fine! If not
 then cut it down.\u201d\u2019","When Jesus saw her
 he called her forward and said to her
 \u2018Woman
 you are set free from your infirmity.\u2019 ","The Lord answered him
 \u2018You hypocrites! Doesn\u2019t each of you on the Sabbath untie your ox or donkey from the stall and lead it out to give it water? ","Then should not this woman
 a daughter of Abraham
 whom Satan has kept bound for eighteen long years
 be set free on the Sabbath day from what bound her?\u2019","Then Jesus asked
 \u2018What is the kingdom of God like? What shall I compare it to? ","It is like a mustard seed
 which a man took and planted in his garden. It grew and became a tree
 and the birds perched in its branches.\u2019","Again he asked
 \u2018What shall I compare the kingdom of God to? ","It is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into about thirty kilograms of flour until it worked all through the dough.\u2019","Someone asked him
 \u2018Lord
 are only a few people going to be saved?\u2019 He said to them
 ","\u2018Make every effort to enter through the narrow door
 because many
 I tell you
 will try to enter and will not be able to. ","Once the owner of the house gets up and closes the door
 you will stand outside knocking and pleading
 \u201cSir
 open the door for us.\u201d \u2018But he will answer
 \u201cI don\u2019t know you or where you come from.\u201d","\u2018Then you will say
 \u201cWe ate and drank with you
 and you taught in our streets.\u201d","\u2018But he will reply
 \u201cI don\u2019t know you or where you come from. Away from me
 all you evildoers!\u201d","\u2018There will be weeping there
 and gnashing of teeth
 when you see Abraham
 Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God
 but you yourselves thrown out. ","People will come from east and west and north and south
 and will take their places at the feast in the kingdom of God. ","Indeed there are those who are last who will be first
 and first who will be last.\u2019","He replied
 \u2018Go and tell that fox
 \u201cI will keep on driving out demons and healing people today and tomorrow
 and on the third day I will reach my goal.\u201d ","In any case
 I must press on today and tomorrow and the next day \u2013 for surely no prophet can die outside Jerusalem!","\u2018Jerusalem
 Jerusalem
 you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you
 how often I have longed to gather your children together
 as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings
 and you were not willing. ","Look
 your house is left to you desolate. I tell you
 you will not see me again until you say
 \u201cBlessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.\u201d\u2019","Jesus asked the Pharisees and experts in the law
 \u2018Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath or not?\u2019 ","Then he asked them
 \u2018If one of you has a child or an ox that falls into a well on the Sabbath day
 will you not immediately pull it out?\u2019 ","\u2018When someone invites you to a wedding feast
 do not take the place of honour
 for a person more distinguished than you may have been invited. ","If so
 the host who invited both of you will come and say to you
 \u201cGive this person your seat.\u201d Then
 humiliated
 you will have to take the least important place. ","But when you are invited
 take the lowest place
 so that when your host comes
 he will say to you
 \u201cFriend
 move up to a better place.\u201d Then you will be honoured in the presence of all the other guests. ","For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled
 and those who humble themselves will be exalted.\u2019","Then Jesus said to his host
 \u2018When you give a luncheon or dinner
 do not invite your friends
 your brothers or sisters
 your relatives
 or your rich neighbours; if you do
 they may invite you back and so you will be repaid. ","But when you give a banquet
 invite the poor
 the crippled
 the lame
 the blind
 ","and you will be blessed. Although they cannot repay you
 you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.\u2019","When one of those at the table with him heard this
 he said to Jesus
 \u2018Blessed is the one who will eat at the feast in the kingdom of God.\u2019","Jesus replied: \u2018A certain man was preparing a great banquet and invited many guests.","At the time of the banquet he sent his servant to tell those who had been invited
 \u201cCome
 for everything is now ready.\u201d","\u2018But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said
 \u201cI have just bought a field
 and I must go and see it. Please excuse me.\u201d","\u2018Another said
 \u201cI have just bought five yoke of oxen
 and I\u2019m on my way to try them out. Please excuse me.\u201d","\u2018Still another said
 \u201cI have just got married
 so I can\u2019t come.\u201d","\u2018The servant came back and reported this to his master. Then the owner of the house became angry and ordered his servant
 \u201cGo out quickly into the streets and alleys of the town and bring in the poor
 the crippled
 the blind and the lame.\u201d","\u2018\u201cSir
\u201d the servant said
 \u201cwhat you ordered has been done
 but there is still room.\u201d","\u2018Then the master told his servant
 \u201cGo out to the roads and country lanes and compel them to come in
 so that my house will be full. ","I tell you
 not one of those who were invited will get a taste of my banquet.\u201d\u2019","Large crowds were travelling with Jesus
 and turning to them he said: ","\u2018If anyone comes to me and does not hate father and mother
 wife and children
 brothers and sisters \u2013 yes
 even their own life \u2013 such a person cannot be my disciple. ","And whoever does not carry their cross and follow me cannot be my disciple.","\u2018Suppose one of you wants to build a tower. Won\u2019t you first sit down and estimate the cost to see if you have enough money to complete it?","For if you lay the foundation and are not able to finish it
 everyone who sees it will ridicule you
 ","saying
 \u201cThis person began to build and wasn\u2019t able to finish.\u201d","\u2018Or suppose a king is about to go to war against another king. Won\u2019t he first sit down and consider whether he is able with ten thousand men to oppose the one coming against him with twenty thousand?","If he is not able
 he will send a delegation while the other is still a long way off and will ask for terms of peace. ","In the same way
 those of you who do not give up everything you have cannot be my disciples.","\u2018Salt is good
 but if it loses its saltiness
 how can it be made salty again? ","It is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure heap; it is thrown out. \u2018Whoever has ears to hear
 let them hear.\u2019","\u2018Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them. Doesn\u2019t he leave the ninety-nine in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he finds it?","And when he finds it
 he joyfully puts it on his shoulders ","and goes home. Then he calls his friends and neighbours together and says
 \u201cRejoice with me; I have found my lost sheep.\u201d ","I tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous people who do not need to repent.","\u2018Or suppose a woman has ten silver coins and loses one. Doesn\u2019t she light a lamp
 sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it? ","And when she finds it
 she calls her friends and neighbours together and says
 \u201cRejoice with me; I have found my lost coin.\u201d ","In the same way
 I tell you
 there is rejoicing in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.\u2019","Jesus continued: \u2018There was a man who had two sons.","The younger one said to his father
 \u201cFather
 give me my share of the estate.\u201d So he divided his property between them.","\u2018Not long after that
 the younger son got together all he had
 set off for a distant country and there squandered his wealth in wild living. ","After he had spent everything
 there was a severe famine in that whole country
 and he began to be in need. ","So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country
 who sent him to his fields to feed pigs. ","He longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating
 but no one gave him anything.","\u2018When he came to his senses
 he said
 \u201cHow many of my father\u2019s hired servants have food to spare
 and here I am starving to death! ","I will set out and go back to my father and say to him: Father
 I have sinned against heaven and against you. ","I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired servants.\u201d","So he got up and went to his father. \u2018But while he was still a long way off
 his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son
 threw his arms round him and kissed him.","\u2018The son said to him
 \u201cFather
 I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.\u201d","\u2018But the father said to his servants
 \u201cQuick! Bring the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. ","Bring the fattened calf and kill it. Let\u2019s have a feast and celebrate.","For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.\u201d So they began to celebrate.","\u2018Meanwhile
 the elder son was in the field. When he came near the house
 he heard music and dancing. ","So he called one of the servants and asked him what was going on.","\u201cYour brother has come
\u201d he replied
 \u201cand your father has killed the fattened calf because he has him back safe and sound.\u201d","\u2018The elder brother became angry and refused to go in. So his father went out and pleaded with him.","But he answered his father
 \u201cLook! All these years I\u2019ve been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders. Yet you never gave me even a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends. ","But when this son of yours who has squandered your property with prostitutes comes home
 you kill the fattened calf for him!\u201d","\u2018\u201cMy son
\u201d the father said
 \u201cyou are always with me
 and everything I have is yours. ","But we had to celebrate and be glad
 because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.\u201d\u2019","Jesus told his disciples: \u2018There was a rich man whose manager was accused of wasting his possessions.","So he called him in and asked him
 \u201cWhat is this I hear about you? Give an account of your management
 because you cannot be manager any longer.\u201d","\u2018The manager said to himself
 \u201cWhat shall I do now? My master is taking away my job. I\u2019m not strong enough to dig
 and I\u2019m ashamed to beg \u2013  ","I know what I\u2019ll do so that
 when I lose my job here
 people will welcome me into their houses.\u201d","\u2018So he called in each one of his master\u2019s debtors. He asked the first
 \u201cHow much do you owe my master?\u201d","\u2018\u201cThree thousand litres of olive oil
\u201d he replied. \u2018The manager told him
 \u201cTake your bill
 sit down quickly
 and make it fifteen hundred.\u201d","\u2018Then he asked the second
 \u201cAnd how much do you owe?\u201d \u2018\u201cThirty tons of wheat
\u201d he replied. \u2018He told him
 \u201cTake your bill and make it twenty-four.\u201d","\u2018The master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly. For the people of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own kind than are the people of the light.","I tell you
 use worldly wealth to gain friends for yourselves
 so that when it is gone
 you will be welcomed into eternal dwellings.","\u2018Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much
 and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much. ","So if you have not been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth
 who will trust you with true riches? ","And if you have not been trustworthy with someone else\u2019s property
 who will give you property of your own?","\u2018No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other
 or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and Money.\u2019","He said to them
 \u2018You are the ones who justify yourselves in the eyes of others
 but God knows your hearts. What people value highly is detestable in God\u2019s sight.","\u2018The Law and the Prophets were proclaimed until John. Since that time
 the good news of the kingdom of God is being preached
 and everyone is forcing their way into it. ","It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.","\u2018Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery
 and the man who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.","\u2018There was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and lived in luxury every day.","At his gate was laid a beggar named Lazarus
 covered with sores ","and longing to eat what fell from the rich man\u2019s table. Even the dogs came and licked his sores.","\u2018The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to Abraham\u2019s side. The rich man also died and was buried.","In Hades
 where he was in torment
 he looked up and saw Abraham far away
 with Lazarus by his side. ","So he called to him
 \u201cFather Abraham
 have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue
 because I am in agony in this fire.\u201d","\u2018But Abraham replied
 \u201cSon
 remember that in your lifetime you received your good things
 while Lazarus received bad things
 but now he is comforted here and you are in agony. ","And besides all this
 between us and you a great chasm has been set in place
 so that those who want to go from here to you cannot
 nor can anyone cross over from there to us.\u201d","\u2018He answered
 \u201cThen I beg you
 father
 send Lazarus to my family
 ","for I have five brothers. Let him warn them
 so that they will not also come to this place of torment.\u201d","\u2018Abraham replied
 \u201cThey have Moses and the Prophets; let them listen to them.\u201d","\u2018\u201cNo
 father Abraham
\u201d he said
 \u201cbut if someone from the dead goes to them
 they will repent.\u201d","\u2018He said to him
 \u201cIf they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets
 they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.\u201d\u2019","Jesus said to his disciples: \u2018Things that cause people to stumble are bound to come
 but woe to anyone through whom they come. ","It would be better for them to be thrown into the sea with a millstone tied round their neck than to cause one of these little ones to stumble.","So watch yourselves. \u2018If your brother or sister sins against you
 rebuke them; and if they repent
 forgive them. ","Even if they sin against you seven times in a day and seven times come back to you saying \u201cI repent
\u201d you must forgive them.\u2019","He replied
 \u2018If you have faith as small as a mustard seed
 you can say to this mulberry tree
 \u201cBe uprooted and planted in the sea
\u201d and it will obey you.","\u2018Suppose one of you has a servant ploughing or looking after the sheep. Will he say to the servant when he comes in from the field
 \u201cCome along now and sit down to eat\u201d? ","Won\u2019t he rather say
 \u201cPrepare my supper
 get yourself ready and wait on me while I eat and drink; after that you may eat and drink\u201d? ","Will he thank the servant because he did what he was told to do?","So you also
 when you have done everything you were told to do
 should say
 \u201cWe are unworthy servants; we have only done our duty.\u201d\u2019","Now on his way to Jerusalem
 Jesus travelled along the border between Samaria and Galilee. ","When he saw them
 he said
 \u2018Go
 show yourselves to the priests.\u2019 And as they went
 they were cleansed.","Jesus asked
 \u2018Were not all ten cleansed? Where are the other nine? ","Has no one returned to give praise to God except this foreigner?\u2019","Then he said to him
 \u2018Rise and go; your faith has made you well.\u2019","Once
 on being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come
 Jesus replied
 \u2018The coming of the kingdom of God is not something that can be observed
 ","nor will people say
 \u201cHere it is
\u201d or \u201cThere it is
\u201d because the kingdom of God is in your midst.\u2019","Then he said to his disciples
 \u2018The time is coming when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man
 but you will not see it. ","People will tell you
 \u201cThere he is!\u201d or \u201cHere he is!\u201d Do not go running off after them. ","For the Son of Man in his day will be like the lightning
 which flashes and lights up the sky from one end to the other. ","But first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.","\u2018Just as it was in the days of Noah
 so also will it be in the days of the Son of Man. ","People were eating
 drinking
 marrying and being given in marriage up to the day Noah entered the ark. Then the flood came and destroyed them all.","\u2018It was the same in the days of Lot. People were eating and drinking
 buying and selling
 planting and building. ","But the day Lot left Sodom
 fire and sulphur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all.","\u2018It will be just like this on the day the Son of Man is revealed.","On that day no one who is on the housetop
 with possessions inside
 should go down to get them. Likewise
 no one in the field should go back for anything. ","Remember Lot\u2019s wife!","Whoever tries to keep their life will lose it
 and whoever loses their life will preserve it. ","I tell you
 on that night two people will be in one bed; one will be taken and the other left. ","Two women will be grinding corn together; one will be taken and the other left.\u2019","\u2018Where
 Lord?\u2019 they asked. He replied
 \u2018Where there is a dead body
 there the vultures will gather.\u2019","He said: \u2018In a certain town there was a judge who neither feared God nor cared what people thought.","And there was a widow in that town who kept coming to him with the plea
 \u201cGrant me justice against my adversary.\u201d","\u2018For some time he refused. But finally he said to himself
 \u201cEven though I don\u2019t fear God or care what people think
 ","yet because this widow keeps bothering me
 I will see that she gets justice
 so that she won\u2019t eventually come and attack me!\u201d\u2019","And the Lord said
 \u2018Listen to what the unjust judge says. ","And will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones
 who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off? ","I tell you
 he will see that they get justice
 and quickly. However
 when the Son of Man comes
 will he find faith on the earth?\u2019","\u2018Two men went up to the temple to pray
 one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. ","The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed: \u201cGod
 I thank you that I am not like other people \u2013 robbers
 evildoers
 adulterers \u2013 or even like this tax collector. ","I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.\u201d","\u2018But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven
 but beat his breast and said
 \u201cGod
 have mercy on me
 a sinner.\u201d","\u2018I tell you that this man
 rather than the other
 went home justified before God. For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled
 and those who humble themselves will be exalted.\u2019","But Jesus called the children to him and said
 \u2018Let the little children come to me
 and do not hinder them
 for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. ","Truly I tell you
 anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.\u2019","\u2018Why do you call me good?\u2019 Jesus answered. \u2018No one is good \u2013 except God alone.","You know the commandments: \u201cYou shall not commit adultery
 you shall not murder
 you shall not steal
 you shall not give false testimony
 honour your father and mother.\u201d\u2019","\u2018All these I have kept since I was a boy
\u2019 he said.","When Jesus heard this
 he said to him
 \u2018You still lack one thing. Sell everything you have and give to the poor
 and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come
 follow me.\u2019","Jesus looked at him and said
 \u2018How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God! ","Indeed
 it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.\u2019","Jesus replied
 \u2018What is impossible with man is possible with God.\u2019","\u2018Truly I tell you
\u2019 Jesus said to them
 \u2018no one who has left home or wife or brothers or sisters or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God ","will fail to receive many times as much in this age
 and in the age to come eternal life.\u2019","Jesus took the Twelve aside and told them
 \u2018We are going up to Jerusalem
 and everything that is written by the prophets about the Son of Man will be fulfilled. ","He will be handed over to the Gentiles. They will mock him
 insult him and spit on him; ","they will flog him and kill him. On the third day he will rise again.\u2019","The disciples did not understand any of this. Its meaning was hidden from them
 and they did not know what he was talking about.","\u2018What do you want me to do for you?\u2019 \u2018Lord
 I want to see
\u2019 he replied.","Jesus said to him
 \u2018Receive your sight; your faith has healed you.\u2019 ","When Jesus reached the spot
 he looked up and said to him
 \u2018Zacchaeus
 come down immediately. I must stay at your house today.\u2019 ","But Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord
 \u2018Look
 Lord! Here and now I give half of my possessions to the poor
 and if I have cheated anybody out of anything
 I will pay back four times the amount.\u2019","Jesus said to him
 \u2018Today salvation has come to this house
 because this man
 too
 is a son of Abraham. ","For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.\u2019","He said: \u2018A man of noble birth went to a distant country to have himself appointed king and then to return.","So he called ten of his servants and gave them ten minas. \u201cPut this money to work
\u201d he said
 \u201cuntil I come back.\u201d","\u2018But his subjects hated him and sent a delegation after him to say
 \u201cWe don\u2019t want this man to be our king.\u201d","\u2018He was made king
 however
 and returned home. Then he sent for the servants to whom he had given the money
 in order to find out what they had gained with it.","\u2018The first one came and said
 \u201cSir
 your mina has earned ten more.\u201d","\u2018\u201cWell done
 my good servant!\u201d his master replied. \u201cBecause you have been trustworthy in a very small matter
 take charge of ten cities.\u201d","\u2018The second came and said
 \u201cSir
 your mina has earned five more.\u201d","\u2018His master answered
 \u201cYou take charge of five cities.\u201d","\u2018Then another servant came and said
 \u201cSir
 here is your mina; I have kept it laid away in a piece of cloth. ","I was afraid of you
 because you are a hard man. You take out what you did not put in and reap what you did not sow.\u201d","\u2018His master replied
 \u201cI will judge you by your own words
 you wicked servant! You knew
 did you
 that I am a hard man
 taking out what I did not put in
 and reaping what I did not sow? ","Why then didn\u2019t you put my money on deposit
 so that when I came back
 I could have collected it with interest?\u201d","\u2018Then he said to those standing by
 \u201cTake his mina away from him and give it to the one who has ten minas.\u201d","\u2018\u201cSir
\u201d they said
 \u201che already has ten!\u201d","\u2018He replied
 \u201cI tell you that to everyone who has
 more will be given
 but as for the one who has nothing
 even what they have will be taken away. ","But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them \u2013 bring them here and kill them in front of me.\u201d\u2019","\u2018Go to the village ahead of you

 you will find a colt tied there

 \u201cWhy are you untying it?\u201d say
 \u201cThe Lord needs it.\u201d\u2019","Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Jesus
 \u2018Teacher

 \u2018if they keep quiet
 the stones will cry out.\u2019","and said
 \u2018If you
 even you
 had only known on this day what would bring you peace \u2013 but now it is hidden from your eyes. ","The days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment against you and encircle you and hem you in on every side.","They will dash you to the ground
 you and the children within your walls. They will not leave one stone on another

\u2019 he said to them
 \u2018\u201cMy house will be a house of prayer\u201d; but you have made it \u201ca den of robbers\u201d.\u2019","He replied
 \u2018I will also ask you a question. Tell me: ","John\u2019s baptism \u2013 was it from heaven
 or of human origin?\u2019","Jesus said
 \u2018Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.\u2019","He went on to tell the people this parable: \u2018A man planted a vineyard
 rented it to some farmers and went away for a long time. ","At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants so they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenants beat him and sent him away empty-handed.","He sent another servant
 but that one also they beat and treated shamefully and sent away empty-handed. ","He sent still a third
 and they wounded him and threw him out.","\u2018Then the owner of the vineyard said
 \u201cWhat shall I do? I will send my son
 whom I love; perhaps they will respect him.\u201d","\u2018But when the tenants saw him
 they talked the matter over. \u201cThis is the heir
\u201d they said. \u201cLet\u2019s kill him
 and the inheritance will be ours.\u201d ","So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. \u2018What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?","He will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others.\u2019 When the people heard this
 they said
 \u2018God forbid!\u2019","Jesus looked directly at them and asked
 \u2018Then what is the meaning of that which is written: \u2018\u201cThe stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone\u201d?","Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces; anyone on whom it falls will be crushed.\u2019","Keeping a close watch on him
 they sent spies
 who pretended to be sincere. They hoped to catch Jesus in something he said
 so that they might hand him over to the power and authority of the governor. ","\u2018Show me a denarius. Whose image and inscription are on it?\u2019 \u2018Caesar\u2019s
\u2019 they replied.","He said to them
 \u2018Then give back to Caesar what is Caesar\u2019s
 and to God what is God\u2019s.\u2019","They were unable to trap him in what he had said there in public. And astonished by his answer
 they became silent.","Jesus replied
 \u2018The people of this age marry and are given in marriage. ","But those who are considered worthy of taking part in the age to come and in the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage
 ","and they can no longer die; for they are like the angels. They are God\u2019s children
 since they are children of the resurrection. ","But in the account of the burning bush
 even Moses showed that the dead rise
 for he calls the Lord \u201cthe God of Abraham
 and the God of Isaac
 and the God of Jacob\u201d. ","He is not the God of the dead
 but of the living
 for to him all are alive.\u2019","Then Jesus said to them
 \u2018Why is it said that the Messiah is the son of David? ","David himself declares in the Book of Psalms: \u2018\u201cThe Lord said to my Lord: \u2018Sit at my right hand","until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.\u2019\u201d","David calls him \u201cLord.\u201d How then can he be his son?\u2019","\u2018Beware of the teachers of the law.

These men will be punished most severely.\u2019","\u2018Truly I tell you
\u2019 he said
 \u2018this poor widow has put in more than all the others. ","All these people gave their gifts out of their wealth; but she out of her poverty put in all she had to live on.\u2019","\u2018As for what you see here
 the time will come when not one stone will be left on another; every one of them will be thrown down.\u2019","He replied: \u2018Watch out that you are not deceived. For many will come in my name
 claiming
 \u201cI am he
\u201d and
 \u201cThe time is near.\u201d Do not follow them. ","When you hear of wars and uprisings
 do not be frightened. These things must happen first
 but the end will not come right away.\u2019","Then he said to them: \u2018Nation will rise against nation
 and kingdom against kingdom. ","There will be great earthquakes
 famines and pestilences in various places
 and fearful events and great signs from heaven.","\u2018But before all this
 they will seize you and persecute you. They will hand you over to synagogues and put you in prison
 and you will be brought before kings and governors
 and all on account of my name. ","And so you will bear testimony to me.","But make up your mind not to worry beforehand how you will defend yourselves.","For I will give you words and wisdom that none of your adversaries will be able to resist or contradict.","You will be betrayed even by parents
 brothers and sisters
 relatives and friends

 and you will win life.","\u2018When you see Jerusalem being surrounded by armies
 you will know that its desolation is near. ","Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains
 let those in the city get out
 and let those in the country not enter the city. ","For this is the time of punishment in fulfilment of all that has been written.","How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers! There will be great distress in the land and wrath against this people.","They will fall by the sword and will be taken as prisoners to all the nations. Jerusalem will be trampled on by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.","\u2018There will be signs in the sun
 moon and stars. On the earth
 nations will be in anguish and perplexity at the roaring and tossing of the sea. ","People will faint from terror
 apprehensive of what is coming on the world
 for the heavenly bodies will be shaken. ","At that time they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.","When these things begin to take place
 stand up and lift up your heads
 because your redemption is drawing near.\u2019","He told them this parable: \u2018Look at the fig-tree and all the trees.","When they sprout leaves
 you can see for yourselves and know that summer is near. ","Even so
 when you see these things happening
 you know that the kingdom of God is near.","\u2018Truly I tell you
 this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened. ","Heaven and earth will pass away
 but my words will never pass away.","\u2018Be careful
 or your hearts will be weighed down with carousing
 drunkenness and the anxieties of life
 and that day will close on you suddenly like a trap. ","For it will come on all those who live on the face of the whole earth.","Be always on the watch
 and pray that you may be able to escape all that is about to happen
 and that you may be able to stand before the Son of Man.\u2019","Jesus sent Peter and John

 \u2018Go and make preparations for us to eat the Passover.\u2019","He replied
 \u2018As you enter the city

 \u2018I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer. ","For I tell you
 I will not eat it again until it finds fulfilment in the kingdom of God.\u2019","After taking the cup
 he gave thanks and said
 \u2018Take this and divide it among you. ","For I tell you I will not drink again from the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.\u2019","And he took bread

 \u2018The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and those who exercise authority over them call themselves Benefactors. ","But you are not to be like that. Instead
 the greatest among you should be like the youngest

 the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the mighty God.\u2019","They all asked
 \u2018Are you then the Son of God?\u2019 He replied
 \u2018You say that I am.\u2019","So Pilate asked Jesus
 \u2018Are you the king of the Jews?\u2019 \u2018You have said so

 it will be measured back to you.\u201d","And He spoke a parable to them: \u201cCan the blind lead the blind? Will they not both fall into the ditch?","A disciple is not above his teacher
 but everyone who is perfectly trained will be like his teacher. ","And why do you look at the speck in your brother\u2019s eye
 but do not perceive the plank in your own eye? ","Or how can you say to your brother
 \u2018Brother
 let me remove the speck that is in your eye
\u2019 when you yourself do not see the plank that is in your own eye? Hypocrite! First remove the plank from your own eye
 and then you will see clearly to remove the speck that is in your brother\u2019s eye. A Tree Is Known by Its Fruit","\u201cFor a good tree does not bear bad fruit
 nor does a bad tree bear good fruit. ","For every tree is known by its own fruit. For men do not gather figs from thorns
 nor do they gather grapes from a bramble bush. ","A good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings forth evil. For out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks. Build on the Rock","\u201cBut why do you call Me \u2018Lord
 Lord
\u2019 and not do the things which I say? ","Whoever comes to Me

 the stream beat vehemently against that house
 and could not shake it
 for it was founded on the rock. ","But he who heard and did nothing is like a man who built a house on the earth without a foundation
 against which the stream beat vehemently; and immediately it fell. And the ruin of that house was great.\u201d","When Jesus heard these things
 He marveled at him
 and turned around and said to the crowd that followed Him

 I have not found such great faith
 not even in Israel!\u201d ","When the Lord saw her
 He had compassion on her and said to her
 \u201cDo not weep.\u201d ","Then He came and touched the open coffin
 and those who carried him stood still. And He said

 He began to speak to the multitudes concerning John: \u201cWhat did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? ","But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft garments? Indeed those who are gorgeously appareled and live in luxury are in kings\u2019 courts.","But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes
 I say to you

 among those born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist; but he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.\u201d","And the Lord said
 \u201cTo what then shall I liken the men of this generation
 and what are they like? ","They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling to one another

 \u201cSimon
 I have something to say to you.\u201d So he said

 and the other fifty. ","And when they had nothing with which to repay
 he freely forgave them both. Tell Me
 therefore

 \u201cI suppose the one whom he forgave more.\u201d And He said to him
 \u201cYou have rightly judged.\u201d ","Then He turned to the woman and said to Simon
 \u201cDo you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave Me no water for My feet

 her sins

 are forgiven

 the same loves little.\u201d","Then He said to her
 \u201cYour sins are forgiven.\u201d","Then He said to the woman
 \u201cYour faith has saved you. Go in peace.\u201d","And when a great multitude had gathered
 and they had come to Him from every city
 He spoke by a parable: ","\u201cA sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed
 some fell by the wayside; and it was trampled down

 it withered away because it lacked moisture. ","And some fell among thorns
 and the thorns sprang up with it and choked it. ","But others fell on good ground
 sprang up
 and yielded a crop a hundredfold.\u201d When He had said these things He cried
 \u201cHe who has ears to hear
 let him hear!\u201d","And He said
 \u201cTo you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God

 And hearing they may not understand.\u2019","\u201cNow the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.","Those by the wayside are the ones who hear; then the devil comes and takes away the word out of their hearts
 lest they should believe and be saved. ","But the ones on the rock are those who
 when they hear
 receive the word with joy; and these have no root
 who believe for a while and in time of temptation fall away. ","Now the ones that fell among thorns are those who
 when they have heard
 go out and are choked with cares
 riches
 and pleasures of life
 and bring no fruit to maturity. ","But the ones that fell on the good ground are those who
 having heard the word with a noble and good heart
 keep it and bear fruit with patience.","\u201cNo one
 when he has lit a lamp
 covers it with a vessel or puts it under a bed

 to him more will be given; and whoever does not have
 even what he seems to have will be taken from him.\u201d","And it was told Him by some
 who said
 \u201cYour mother and Your brothers are standing outside
 desiring to see You.\u201d","But He answered and said to them
 \u201cMy mother and My brothers are these who hear the word of God and do it.\u201d","Now it happened
 on a certain day
 that He got into a boat with His disciples. And He said to them
 \u201cLet us cross over to the other side of the lake.\u201d And they launched out. ","But He said to them
 \u201cWhere is your faith?\u201d And they were afraid
 and marveled

 \u201cWho can this be? For He commands even the winds and water

 and tell what great things God has done for you.\u201d And he went his way and proclaimed throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him.","And Jesus said

 be of good cheer; your faith has made you well. Go in peace.\u201d","But when Jesus heard it
 He answered him

 \u201cWe have no more than five loaves and two fish

 \u201cMake them sit down in groups of fifty.\u201d ","And it happened
 as He was alone praying

 \u201cThe Christ of God.\u201d","saying
 \u201cThe Son of Man must suffer many things

 \u201cFollow Me.\u201d But he said
 \u201cLord
 let me first go and bury my father.\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cLet the dead bury their own dead

 \u201cNo one

 first say
 \u2018Peace to this house.\u2019 ","And if a son of peace is there
 your peace will rest on it; if not
 it will return to you. ","And remain in the same house

 eat such things as are set before you. ","And heal the sick there

 \u2018The kingdom of God has come near to you.\u2019 ","But whatever city you enter

 go out into its streets and say
 ","\u2018The very dust of your city which clings to us we wipe off against you. Nevertheless know this
 that the kingdom of God has come near you.\u2019 ","But I say to you that it will be more tolerable in that Day for Sodom than for that city.","\u201cWoe to you
 Chorazin! Woe to you
 Bethsaida! For if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon
 they would have repented long ago
 sitting in sackcloth and ashes. ","But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you.","And you
 Capernaum

 and no one knows who the Son is except the Father
 and who the Father is except the Son
 and the one to whom the Son wills to reveal Him.\u201d","Then He turned to His disciples and said privately
 \u201cBlessed are the eyes which see the things you see; ","for I tell you that many prophets and kings have desired to see what you see
 and have not seen it

 and have not heard it.\u201d The Parable of the Good Samaritan","And behold
 a certain lawyer stood up and tested Him
 saying
 \u201cTeacher
 what shall I do to inherit eternal life?\u201d","He said to him
 \u201cWhat is written in the law? What is your reading of it?\u201d","And He said to him
 \u201cYou have answered rightly; do this and you will live.\u201d","Then Jesus answered and said: \u201cA certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho
 and fell among thieves
 who stripped him of his clothing
 wounded him
 and departed
 leaving him half dead. ","Now by chance a certain priest came down that road. And when he saw him
 he passed by on the other side. ","Likewise a Levite
 when he arrived at the place
 came and looked
 and passed by on the other side. ","But a certain Samaritan
 as he journeyed
 came where he was. And when he saw him
 he had compassion. ","So he went to him and bandaged his wounds
 pouring on oil and wine; and he set him on his own animal
 brought him to an inn
 and took care of him. ","On the next day
 when he departed
 he took out two denarii
 gave them to the innkeeper
 and said to him
 \u2018Take care of him; and whatever more you spend
 when I come again
 I will repay you.\u2019 ","So which of these three do you think was neighbor to him who fell among the thieves?\u201d","And he said
 \u201cHe who showed mercy on him.\u201d Then Jesus said to him
 \u201cGo and do likewise.\u201d","And Jesus answered and said to her
 \u201cMartha
 Martha
 you are worried and troubled about many things. ","But one thing is needed
 and Mary has chosen that good part
 which will not be taken away from her.\u201d","Now it came to pass
 as He was praying in a certain place
 when He ceased
 that one of His disciples said to Him
 \u201cLord
 teach us to pray
 as John also taught his disciples.\u201d","So He said to them
 \u201cWhen you pray
 say: Our Father in heaven
 Hallowed be Your name. Your kingdom come. Your will be done On earth as it is in heaven.","Give us day by day our daily bread.","And forgive us our sins
 For we also forgive everyone who is indebted to us. And do not lead us into temptation
 But deliver us from the evil one.\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cWhich of you shall have a friend
 and go to him at midnight and say to him
 \u2018Friend
 lend me three loaves; ","for a friend of mine has come to me on his journey
 and I have nothing to set before him\u2019; ","and he will answer from within and say
 \u2018Do not trouble me; the door is now shut
 and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give to you\u2019? ","I say to you
 though he will not rise and give to him because he is his friend
 yet because of his persistence he will rise and give him as many as he needs.","\u201cSo I say to you
 ask
 and it will be given to you; seek
 and you will find; knock
 and it will be opened to you. ","For everyone who asks receives
 and he who seeks finds
 and to him who knocks it will be opened. ","If a son asks for bread from any father among you
 will he give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish
 will he give him a serpent instead of a fish? ","Or if he asks for an egg
 will he offer him a scorpion? ","If you then
 being evil
 know how to give good gifts to your children
 how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him!\u201d","And He was casting out a demon
 and it was mute. So it was
 when the demon had gone out
 that the mute spoke; and the multitudes marveled. ","But He
 knowing their thoughts
 said to them: \u201cEvery kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation
 and a house divided against a house falls. ","If Satan also is divided against himself
 how will his kingdom stand? Because you say I cast out demons by Beelzebub. ","And if I cast out demons by Beelzebub
 by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges. ","But if I cast out demons with the finger of God
 surely the kingdom of God has come upon you. ","When a strong man
 fully armed
 guards his own palace
 his goods are in peace. ","But when a stronger than he comes upon him and overcomes him
 he takes from him all his armor in which he trusted
 and divides his spoils. ","He who is not with Me is against Me
 and he who does not gather with Me scatters.","\u201cWhen an unclean spirit goes out of a man
 he goes through dry places
 seeking rest; and finding none
 he says
 \u2018I will return to my house from which I came.\u2019 ","And when he comes
 he finds it swept and put in order. ","Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself
 and they enter and dwell there; and the last state of that man is worse than the first.\u201d","And it happened
 as He spoke these things
 that a certain woman from the crowd raised her voice and said to Him
 \u201cBlessed is the womb that bore You
 and the breasts which nursed You!\u201d","But He said
 \u201cMore than that
 blessed are those who hear the word of God and keep it!\u201d","And while the crowds were thickly gathered together
 He began to say
 \u201cThis is an evil generation. It seeks a sign

 for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and indeed a greater than Jonah is here. The Lamp of the Body","\u201cNo one
 when he has lit a lamp
 puts it in a secret place or under a basket
 but on a lampstand
 that those who come in may see the light. ","The lamp of the body is the eye. Therefore
 when your eye is good
 your whole body also is full of light. But when your eye is bad
 your body also is full of darkness. ","Therefore take heed that the light which is in you is not darkness.","If then your whole body is full of light
 having no part dark
 the whole body will be full of light
 as when the bright shining of a lamp gives you light.\u201d","Then the Lord said to him
 \u201cNow you Pharisees make the outside of the cup and dish clean
 but your inward part is full of greed and wickedness. ","Foolish ones! Did not He who made the outside make the inside also?","But rather give alms of such things as you have; then indeed all things are clean to you.","\u201cBut woe to you Pharisees! For you tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs
 and pass by justice and the love of God. These you ought to have done
 without leaving the others undone. ","Woe to you Pharisees! For you love the best seats in the synagogues and greetings in the marketplaces.","Woe to you
 scribes and Pharisees
 hypocrites! For you are like graves which are not seen

 you bear witness that you approve the deeds of your fathers; for they indeed killed them
 and you build their tombs. ","Therefore the wisdom of God also said
 \u2018I will send them prophets and apostles

 ","from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah who perished between the altar and the temple. Yes
 I say to you
 it shall be required of this generation.","\u201cWoe to you lawyers! For you have taken away the key of knowledge. You did not enter in yourselves

 when an innumerable multitude of people had gathered together
 so that they trampled one another
 He began to say to His disciples first of all
 \u201cBeware of the leaven of the Pharisees

 nor hidden that will not be known. ","Therefore whatever you have spoken in the dark will be heard in the light

 My friends
 do not be afraid of those who kill the body

 after He has killed
 has power to cast into hell; yes
 I say to you
 fear Him!","\u201cAre not five sparrows sold for two copper coins? And not one of them is forgotten before God.","But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Do not fear therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows.","\u201cAlso I say to you
 whoever confesses Me before men
 him the Son of Man also will confess before the angels of God. ","But he who denies Me before men will be denied before the angels of God.","\u201cAnd anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man
 it will be forgiven him; but to him who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit

 \u2018I will do this: I will pull down my barns and build greater

 \u201cTherefore I say to you
 do not worry about your life

 what you will put on. ","Life is more than food

 why are you anxious for the rest? ","Consider the lilies
 how they grow: they neither toil nor spin; and yet I say to you
 even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. ","If then God so clothes the grass
 which today is in the field and tomorrow is thrown into the oven
 how much more will He clothe you
 O you of little faith?","\u201cAnd do not seek what you should eat or what you should drink
 nor have an anxious mind. ","For all these things the nations of the world seek after

 little flock

 and how I wish it were already kindled! ","But I have a baptism to be baptized with
 and how distressed I am till it is accomplished! ","Do you suppose that I came to give peace on earth? I tell you
 not at all

 \u201cWhenever you see a cloud rising out of the west
 immediately you say
 \u2018A shower is coming\u2019; and so it is. ","And when you see the south wind blow
 you say
 \u2018There will be hot weather\u2019; and there is. ","Hypocrites! You can discern the face of the sky and of the earth

 even of yourselves
 do you not judge what is right? ","When you go with your adversary to the magistrate

 you shall not depart from there till you have paid the very last mite.\u201d","And Jesus answered and said to them
 \u201cDo you suppose that these Galileans were worse sinners than all other Galileans

 no; but unless you repent you will all likewise perish. ","Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them
 do you think that they were worse sinners than all other men who dwelt in Jerusalem? ","I tell you
 no; but unless you repent you will all likewise perish.\u201d","He also spoke this parable: \u201cA certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard
 and he came seeking fruit on it and found none. ","Then he said to the keeper of his vineyard
 \u2018Look
 for three years I have come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none. Cut it down; why does it use up the ground?\u2019 ","But he answered and said to him
 \u2018Sir
 let it alone this year also

 well. But if not
 after that you can cut it down.\u2019 \u201d","But when Jesus saw her
 He called her to Him and said to her
 \u201cWoman

 \u201cHypocrite! Does not each one of you on the Sabbath loose his ox or donkey from the stall
 and lead it away to water it? ","So ought not this woman
 being a daughter of Abraham

 be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath?\u201d ","Then He said
 \u201cWhat is the kingdom of God like? And to what shall I compare it? ","It is like a mustard seed
 which a man took and put in his garden; and it grew and became a large tree
 and the birds of the air nested in its branches.\u201d","And again He said
 \u201cTo what shall I liken the kingdom of God? ","It is like leaven

 answering
 spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees

 go and sit down in the lowest place

 invite the poor

 he said to Him
 \u201cBlessed is he who shall eat bread in the kingdom of God!\u201d","Then He said to him
 \u201cA certain man gave a great supper and invited many
 ","and sent his servant at supper time to say to those who were invited
 \u2018Come

 \u2018I have bought five yoke of oxen
 and I am going to test them. I ask you to have me excused.\u2019 ","Still another said
 \u2018I have married a wife
 and therefore I cannot come.\u2019 ","So that servant came and reported these things to his master. Then the master of the house
 being angry
 said to his servant
 \u2018Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city

 \u2018Master
 it is done as you commanded

 ","\u201cIf anyone comes to Me and does not hate his father and mother

 the younger son gathered all together

 there arose a severe famine in that land

 and no one gave him anything.","\u201cBut when he came to himself
 he said
 \u2018How many of my father\u2019s hired servants have bread enough and to spare

 \u201cFather
 I have sinned against heaven and before you

 \u2018Father
 I have sinned against heaven and in your sight
 and am no longer worthy to be called your son.\u2019","\u201cBut the father said to his servants
 \u2018Bring out the best robe and put it on him
 and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet. ","And bring the fatted calf here and kill it
 and let us eat and be merry; ","for this my son was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.\u2019 And they began to be merry.","\u201cNow his older son was in the field. And as he came and drew near to the house
 he heard music and dancing. ","So he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant.","And he said to him
 \u2018Your brother has come
 and because he has received him safe and sound
 your father has killed the fatted calf.\u2019","\u201cBut he was angry and would not go in. Therefore his father came out and pleaded with him.","So he answered and said to his father
 \u2018Lo
 these many years I have been serving you; I never transgressed your commandment at any time; and yet you never gave me a young goat
 that I might make merry with my friends. ","But as soon as this son of yours came
 who has devoured your livelihood with harlots
 you killed the fatted calf for him.\u2019","\u201cAnd he said to him
 \u2018Son
 you are always with me
 and all that I have is yours. ","It was right that we should make merry and be glad
 for your brother was dead and is alive again
 and was lost and is found.\u2019 \u201d","He also said to His disciples: \u201cThere was a certain rich man who had a steward
 and an accusation was brought to him that this man was wasting his goods. ","So he called him and said to him
 \u2018What is this I hear about you? Give an account of your stewardship
 for you can no longer be steward.\u2019","\u201cThen the steward said within himself
 \u2018What shall I do? For my master is taking the stewardship away from me. I cannot dig; I am ashamed to beg. ","I have resolved what to do
 that when I am put out of the stewardship
 they may receive me into their houses.\u2019","\u201cSo he called every one of his master\u2019s debtors to him
 and said to the first
 \u2018How much do you owe my master?\u2019 ","And he said
 \u2018A hundred measures of oil.\u2019 So he said to him
 \u2018Take your bill
 and sit down quickly and write fifty.\u2019 ","Then he said to another
 \u2018And how much do you owe?\u2019 So he said
 \u2018A hundred measures of wheat.\u2019 And he said to him
 \u2018Take your bill
 and write eighty.\u2019 ","So the master commended the unjust steward because he had dealt shrewdly. For the sons of this world are more shrewd in their generation than the sons of light.","\u201cAnd I say to you
 make friends for yourselves by unrighteous mammon
 that when you fail
 they may receive you into an everlasting home. ","He who is faithful in what is least is faithful also in much; and he who is unjust in what is least is unjust also in much.","Therefore if you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon
 who will commit to your trust the true riches? ","And if you have not been faithful in what is another man\u2019s
 who will give you what is your own?","\u201cNo servant can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other
 or else he will be loyal to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cYou are those who justify yourselves before men
 but God knows your hearts. For what is highly esteemed among men is an abomination in the sight of God.","\u201cThe law and the prophets were until John. Since that time the kingdom of God has been preached
 and everyone is pressing into it. ","And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one tittle of the law to fail.","\u201cWhoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery; and whoever marries her who is divorced from her husband commits adultery.","\u201cThere was a certain rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and fared sumptuously every day.","But there was a certain beggar named Lazarus
 full of sores
 who was laid at his gate
 ","desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man\u2019s table. Moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.","So it was that the beggar died
 and was carried by the angels to Abraham\u2019s bosom. The rich man also died and was buried. ","And being in torments in Hades
 he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham afar off
 and Lazarus in his bosom.","\u201cThen he cried and said
 \u2018Father Abraham
 have mercy on me
 and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.\u2019 ","But Abraham said
 \u2018Son
 remember that in your lifetime you received your good things
 and likewise Lazarus evil things; but now he is comforted and you are tormented. ","And besides all this
 between us and you there is a great gulf fixed
 so that those who want to pass from here to you cannot
 nor can those from there pass to us.\u2019","\u201cThen he said
 \u2018I beg you therefore
 father
 that you would send him to my father\u2019s house
 ","for I have five brothers
 that he may testify to them
 lest they also come to this place of torment.\u2019 ","Abraham said to him
 \u2018They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.\u2019 ","And he said
 \u2018No
 father Abraham; but if one goes to them from the dead
 they will repent.\u2019 ","But he said to him
 \u2018If they do not hear Moses and the prophets
 neither will they be persuaded though one rise from the dead.\u2019 \u201d","Then He said to the disciples
 \u201cIt is impossible that no offenses should come
 but woe to him through whom they do come! ","It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck
 and he were thrown into the sea
 than that he should offend one of these little ones. ","Take heed to yourselves. If your brother sins against you
 rebuke him; and if he repents
 forgive him. ","And if he sins against you seven times in a day
 and seven times in a day returns to you
 saying
 \u2018I repent
\u2019 you shall forgive him.\u201d","So the Lord said
 \u201cIf you have faith as a mustard seed
 you can say to this mulberry tree
 \u2018Be pulled up by the roots and be planted in the sea
\u2019 and it would obey you. ","And which of you
 having a servant plowing or tending sheep
 will say to him when he has come in from the field
 \u2018Come at once and sit down to eat\u2019? ","But will he not rather say to him
 \u2018Prepare something for my supper
 and gird yourself and serve me till I have eaten and drunk
 and afterward you will eat and drink\u2019? ","Does he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I think not.","So likewise you
 when you have done all those things which you are commanded
 say
 \u2018We are unprofitable servants. We have done what was our duty to do.\u2019 \u201d","Now it happened as He went to Jerusalem that He passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.","So when He saw them
 He said to them
 \u201cGo
 show yourselves to the priests.\u201d And so it was that as they went
 they were cleansed.","So Jesus answered and said
 \u201cWere there not ten cleansed? But where are the nine? ","Were there not any found who returned to give glory to God except this foreigner?\u201d","And He said to him
 \u201cArise
 go your way. Your faith has made you well.\u201d","Now when He was asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come
 He answered them and said
 \u201cThe kingdom of God does not come with observation; ","nor will they say
 \u2018See here!\u2019 or \u2018See there!\u2019 For indeed
 the kingdom of God is within you.\u201d","Then He said to the disciples
 \u201cThe days will come when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man
 and you will not see it. ","And they will say to you
 \u2018Look here!\u2019 or \u2018Look there!\u2019 Do not go after them or follow them. ","For as the lightning that flashes out of one part under heaven shines to the other part under heaven
 so also the Son of Man will be in His day. ","But first He must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.","And as it was in the days of Noah
 so it will be also in the days of the Son of Man: ","They ate
 they drank
 they married wives
 they were given in marriage
 until the day that Noah entered the ark
 and the flood came and destroyed them all. ","Likewise as it was also in the days of Lot: They ate
 they drank
 they bought
 they sold
 they planted
 they built; ","but on the day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all.","Even so will it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed.","\u201cIn that day
 he who is on the housetop
 and his goods are in the house
 let him not come down to take them away. And likewise the one who is in the field
 let him not turn back. ","Remember Lot\u2019s wife.","Whoever seeks to save his life will lose it
 and whoever loses his life will preserve it. ","I tell you
 in that night there will be two men in one bed: the one will be taken and the other will be left. ","Two women will be grinding together: the one will be taken and the other left.","And they answered and said to Him
 \u201cWhere
 Lord?\u201d So He said to them
 \u201cWherever the body is
 there the eagles will be gathered together.\u201d","saying: \u201cThere was in a certain city a judge who did not fear God nor regard man.","Now there was a widow in that city; and she came to him
 saying
 \u2018Get justice for me from my adversary.\u2019 ","And he would not for a while; but afterward he said within himself
 \u2018Though I do not fear God nor regard man
 ","yet because this widow troubles me I will avenge her
 lest by her continual coming she weary me.\u2019 \u201d","Then the Lord said
 \u201cHear what the unjust judge said. ","And shall God not avenge His own elect who cry out day and night to Him
 though He bears long with them? ","I tell you that He will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless
 when the Son of Man comes
 will He really find faith on the earth?\u201d","\u201cTwo men went up to the temple to pray
 one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. ","The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself
 \u2018God
 I thank You that I am not like other men\u2014extortioners
 unjust
 adulterers
 or even as this tax collector. ","I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I possess.\u2019","And the tax collector
 standing afar off
 would not so much as raise his eyes to heaven
 but beat his breast
 saying
 \u2018God
 be merciful to me a sinner!\u2019 ","I tell you
 this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled
 and he who humbles himself will be exalted.\u201d","But Jesus called them to Him and said
 \u201cLet the little children come to Me
 and do not forbid them; for of such is the kingdom of God. ","Assuredly
 I say to you
 whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will by no means enter it.\u201d","So Jesus said to him
 \u201cWhy do you call Me good? No one is good but One
 that is
 God. ","You know the commandments: \u2018Do not commit adultery
\u2019 \u2018Do not murder
\u2019 \u2018Do not steal
\u2019 \u2018Do not bear false witness
\u2019 \u2018Honor your father and your mother.\u2019 \u201d","And he said
 \u201cAll these things I have kept from my youth.\u201d","So when Jesus heard these things
 He said to him
 \u201cYou still lack one thing. Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor
 and you will have treasure in heaven; and come
 follow Me.\u201d","And when Jesus saw that he became very sorrowful
 He said
 \u201cHow hard it is for those who have riches to enter the kingdom of God! ","For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.\u201d","But He said
 \u201cThe things which are impossible with men are possible with God.\u201d","So He said to them
 \u201cAssuredly
 I say to you
 there is no one who has left house or parents or brothers or wife or children
 for the sake of the kingdom of God
 ","who shall not receive many times more in this present time
 and in the age to come eternal life.\u201d","Then He took the twelve aside and said to them
 \u201cBehold
 we are going up to Jerusalem
 and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of Man will be accomplished. ","For He will be delivered to the Gentiles and will be mocked and insulted and spit upon.","They will scourge Him and kill Him. And the third day He will rise again.\u201d","But they understood none of these things; this saying was hidden from them

 \u201cWhat do you want Me to do for you?\u201d He said

 that I may receive my sight.\u201d","Then Jesus said to him
 \u201cReceive your sight; your faith has made you well.\u201d ","And when Jesus came to the place
 He looked up and saw him
 and said to him
 \u201cZacchaeus

 \u201cLook

 I restore fourfold.\u201d","And Jesus said to him
 \u201cToday salvation has come to this house
 because he also is a son of Abraham; ","for the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost.\u201d","Therefore He said: \u201cA certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return.","So he called ten of his servants

 \u2018Out of your own mouth I will judge you

 \u201cI also will ask you one thing

 \u201cNeither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.\u201d","Then He began to tell the people this parable: \u201cA certain man planted a vineyard
 leased it to vinedressers

 that they might give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the vinedressers beat him and sent him away empty-handed. ","Again he sent another servant; and they beat him also
 treated him shamefully
 and sent him away empty-handed. ","And again he sent a third; and they wounded him also and cast him out.","\u201cThen the owner of the vineyard said
 \u2018What shall I do? I will send my beloved son. Probably they will respect him when they see him.\u2019 ","But when the vinedressers saw him
 they reasoned among themselves
 saying
 \u2018This is the heir. Come
 let us kill him
 that the inheritance may be ours.\u2019 ","So they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him. Therefore what will the owner of the vineyard do to them?","He will come and destroy those vinedressers and give the vineyard to others.\u201d And when they heard it they said
 \u201cCertainly not!\u201d","Then He looked at them and said
 \u201cWhat then is this that is written: \u2018The stone which the builders rejected Has become the chief cornerstone\u2019?","Whoever falls on that stone will be broken; but on whomever it falls
 it will grind him to powder.\u201d","So they watched Him
 and sent spies who pretended to be righteous

 \u201cThe sons of this age marry and are given in marriage. ","But those who are counted worthy to attain that age
 and the resurrection from the dead
 neither marry nor are given in marriage; ","nor can they die anymore

 being sons of the resurrection. ","But even Moses showed in the burning bush passage that the dead are raised
 when he called the Lord \u2018the God of Abraham
 the God of Isaac

 \u201cTruly I say to you that this poor widow has put in more than all; ","for all these out of their abundance have put in offerings for God

 with perplexity
 the sea and the waves roaring; ","men\u2019s hearts failing them from fear and the expectation of those things which are coming on the earth

 I will no longer eat of it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.\u201d","Then He took the cup
 and gave thanks

 \u201cTake this and divide it among yourselves; ","for I say to you
 I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.\u201d","And He took bread

 He breathed His last.","Then
 as they were afraid and bowed their faces to the earth

 \u201cWhy do you seek the living among the dead? ","And He said to them
 \u201cWhat kind of conversation is this that you have with one another as you walk and are sad?\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cWhat things?\u201d So they said to Him
 \u201cThe things concerning Jesus of Nazareth

 \u201cO foolish ones
 and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken! ","Ought not the Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into His glory?\u201d","Now as they said these things

 and marveled
 He said to them
 \u201cHave you any food here?\u201d ","Then He said to them
 \u201cThese are the words which I spoke to you while I was still with you

 \u201cThus it is written

 I send the Promise of My Father upon you; but tarry in the city of Jerusalem until you are endued with power from on high.\u201d The Ascension","\u201cBut why did you need to search?\u201d he asked. \u201cDidn\u2019t you know that I must be in my Father\u2019s house?\u201d","But Jesus told him
 \u201cNo! The Scriptures say
 \u2018People do not live by bread alone.\u2019\u201d","\u201cI will give you the glory of these kingdoms and authority over them

 \u201cbecause they are mine to give to anyone I please.","Jesus replied
 \u201cThe Scriptures say
 \u2018You must worship the Lord your God and serve only him.\u2019\u201d","Then the devil took him to Jerusalem
 to the highest point of the Temple
 and said
 \u201cIf you are the Son of God

 \u201cThe Scriptures also say
 \u2018You must not test the Lord your God.\u2019\u201d","\u201cThe Spirit of the Lord is upon me

 \u201cYou will undoubtedly quote me this proverb: \u2018Physician
 heal yourself\u2019\u2014meaning
 \u2018Do miracles here in your hometown like those you did in Capernaum.\u2019","But I tell you the truth
 no prophet is accepted in his own hometown.","\u201cCertainly there were many needy widows in Israel in Elijah\u2019s time
 when the heavens were closed for three and a half years
 and a severe famine devastated the land.","Yet Elijah was not sent to any of them. He was sent instead to a foreigner\u2014a widow of Zarephath in the land of Sidon.","And many in Israel had leprosy in the time of the prophet Elisha

 a Syrian.\u201d","There
 too
 the people were amazed at his teaching
 for he spoke with authority.","But Jesus reprimanded him. \u201cBe quiet! Come out of the man
\u201d he ordered. At that
 the demon threw the man to the floor as the crowd watched; then it came out of him without hurting him further.","Many were possessed by demons; and the demons came out at his command
 shouting
 \u201cYou are the Son of God!\u201d But because they knew he was the Messiah
 he rebuked them and refused to let them speak.","But he replied
 \u201cI must preach the Good News of the Kingdom of God in other towns
 too
 because that is why I was sent.\u201d","When he had finished speaking
 he said to Simon
 \u201cNow go out where it is deeper
 and let down your nets to catch some fish.\u201d","His partners
 James and John
 the sons of Zebedee
 were also amazed. Jesus replied to Simon
 \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid! From now on you\u2019ll be fishing for people!\u201d","Jesus reached out and touched him. \u201cI am willing
\u201d he said. \u201cBe healed!\u201d And instantly the leprosy disappeared.","Then Jesus instructed him not to tell anyone what had happened. He said
 \u201cGo to the priest and let him examine you. Take along the offering required in the law of Moses for those who have been healed of leprosy. This will be a public testimony that you have been cleansed.\u201d","Seeing their faith
 Jesus said to the man
 \u201cYoung man
 your sins are forgiven.\u201d","Jesus knew what they were thinking
 so he asked them
 \u201cWhy do you question this in your hearts?","Is it easier to say \u2018Your sins are forgiven
\u2019 or \u2018Stand up and walk\u2019?","So I will prove to you that the Son of Man has the authority on earth to forgive sins.\u201d Then Jesus turned to the paralyzed man and said
 \u201cStand up
 pick up your mat
 and go home!\u201d","Later
 as Jesus left the town
 he saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at his tax collector\u2019s booth. \u201cFollow me and be my disciple

 \u201cHealthy people don\u2019t need a doctor\u2014sick people do.","I have come to call not those who think they are righteous

 \u201cDo wedding guests fast while celebrating with the groom? Of course not.","But someday the groom will be taken away from them
 and then they will fast.\u201d","Then Jesus gave them this illustration: \u201cNo one tears a piece of cloth from a new garment and uses it to patch an old garment. For then the new garment would be ruined
 and the new patch wouldn\u2019t even match the old garment.","\u201cAnd no one puts new wine into old wineskins. For the new wine would burst the wineskins
 spilling the wine and ruining the skins.","New wine must be stored in new wineskins.","But no one who drinks the old wine seems to want the new wine. \u2018The old is just fine

 \u201cHaven\u2019t you read in the Scriptures what David did when he and his companions were hungry?","He went into the house of God and broke the law by eating the sacred loaves of bread that only the priests can eat. He also gave some to his companions.\u201d","And Jesus added
 \u201cThe Son of Man is Lord

 \u201cCome and stand in front of everyone.\u201d So the man came forward.","Then Jesus said to his critics
 \u201cI have a question for you. Does the law permit good deeds on the Sabbath

 \u201cHold out your hand.\u201d So the man held out his hand
 and it was restored!","God blesses you who are hungry now

 be happy! Yes
 leap for joy! For a great reward awaits you in heaven. And remember
 their ancestors treated the ancient prophets that same way.","\u201cWhat sorrow awaits you who are rich
 for you have your only happiness now.","What sorrow awaits you who are fat and prosperous now
 for a time of awful hunger awaits you. What sorrow awaits you who laugh now
 for your laughing will turn to mourning and sorrow.","What sorrow awaits you who are praised by the crowds
 for their ancestors also praised false prophets.","\u201cBut to you who are willing to listen
 I say
 love your enemies! Do good to those who hate you.","Bless those who curse you. Pray for those who hurt you.","If someone slaps you on one cheek
 offer the other cheek also. If someone demands your coat
 offer your shirt also.","Give to anyone who asks; and when things are taken away from you
 don\u2019t try to get them back.","Do to others as you would like them to do to you.","\u201cIf you love only those who love you
 why should you get credit for that? Even sinners love those who love them!","And if you do good only to those who do good to you
 why should you get credit? Even sinners do that much!","And if you lend money only to those who can repay you
 why should you get credit? Even sinners will lend to other sinners for a full return.","\u201cLove your enemies! Do good to them. Lend to them without expecting to be repaid. Then your reward from heaven will be very great
 and you will truly be acting as children of the Most High
 for he is kind to those who are unthankful and wicked.","You must be compassionate
 just as your Father is compassionate.","\u201cDo not judge others
 and you will not be judged. Do not condemn others

 and you will be forgiven.","Give
 and you will receive. Your gift will return to you in full\u2014pressed down
 shaken together to make room for more
 running over
 and poured into your lap. The amount you give will determine the amount you get back.\u201d","Then Jesus gave the following illustration: \u201cCan one blind person lead another? Won\u2019t they both fall into a ditch?","Students are not greater than their teacher. But the student who is fully trained will become like the teacher.","\u201cAnd why worry about a speck in your friend\u2019s eye when you have a log in your own?","How can you think of saying
 \u2018Friend
 let me help you get rid of that speck in your eye
\u2019 when you can\u2019t see past the log in your own eye? Hypocrite! First get rid of the log in your own eye; then you will see well enough to deal with the speck in your friend\u2019s eye.","\u201cA good tree can\u2019t produce bad fruit
 and a bad tree can\u2019t produce good fruit.","A tree is identified by its fruit. Figs are never gathered from thornbushes
 and grapes are not picked from bramble bushes.","A good person produces good things from the treasury of a good heart
 and an evil person produces evil things from the treasury of an evil heart. What you say flows from what is in your heart.","\u201cSo why do you keep calling me \u2018Lord
 Lord!\u2019 when you don\u2019t do what I say?","I will show you what it\u2019s like when someone comes to me
 listens to my teaching
 and then follows it.","It is like a person building a house who digs deep and lays the foundation on solid rock. When the floodwaters rise and break against that house
 it stands firm because it is well built.","But anyone who hears and doesn\u2019t obey is like a person who builds a house right on the ground

 he was amazed. Turning to the crowd that was following him
 he said

 his heart overflowed with compassion. \u201cDon\u2019t cry!\u201d he said.","Then he walked over to the coffin and touched it

 \u201cGod blesses those who do not fall away because of me.\u201d","After John\u2019s disciples left
 Jesus began talking about him to the crowds. \u201cWhat kind of man did you go into the wilderness to see? Was he a weak reed
 swayed by every breath of wind?","Or were you expecting to see a man dressed in expensive clothes? No
 people who wear beautiful clothes and live in luxury are found in palaces.","Were you looking for a prophet? Yes

 of all who have ever lived
 none is greater than John.

 he would know what kind of woman is touching him. She\u2019s a sinner!\u201d","Then Jesus answered his thoughts. \u201cSimon
\u201d he said to the Pharisee
 \u201cI have something to say to you.\u201d \u201cGo ahead
 Teacher
\u201d Simon replied.","Then Jesus told him this story: \u201cA man loaned money to two people\u2014500 pieces of silver to one and 50 pieces to the other.","But neither of them could repay him
 so he kindly forgave them both
 canceling their debts. Who do you suppose loved him more after that?\u201d","Simon answered
 \u201cI suppose the one for whom he canceled the larger debt.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s right
\u201d Jesus said.","Then he turned to the woman and said to Simon
 \u201cLook at this woman kneeling here. When I entered your home
 you didn\u2019t offer me water to wash the dust from my feet
 but she has washed them with her tears and wiped them with her hair.","You didn\u2019t greet me with a kiss
 but from the time I first came in
 she has not stopped kissing my feet.","You neglected the courtesy of olive oil to anoint my head
 but she has anointed my feet with rare perfume.","\u201cI tell you
 her sins\u2014and they are many\u2014have been forgiven
 so she has shown me much love. But a person who is forgiven little shows only little love.\u201d","Then Jesus said to the woman
 \u201cYour sins are forgiven.\u201d","And Jesus said to the woman
 \u201cYour faith has saved you; go in peace.\u201d","One day Jesus told a story in the form of a parable to a large crowd that had gathered from many towns to hear him:","\u201cA farmer went out to plant his seed. As he scattered it across his field
 some seed fell on a footpath
 where it was stepped on
 and the birds ate it.","Other seed fell among rocks. It began to grow
 but the plant soon wilted and died for lack of moisture.","Other seed fell among thorns that grew up with it and choked out the tender plants.","Still other seed fell on fertile soil. This seed grew and produced a crop that was a hundred times as much as had been planted!\u201d When he had said this
 he called out
 \u201cAnyone with ears to hear should listen and understand.\u201d","He replied
 \u201cYou are permitted to understand the secrets of the Kingdom of God. But I use parables to teach the others so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled: \u2018When they look
 they won\u2019t really see. When they hear
 they won\u2019t understand.\u2019","\u201cThis is the meaning of the parable: The seed is God\u2019s word.","The seeds that fell on the footpath represent those who hear the message
 only to have the devil come and take it away from their hearts and prevent them from believing and being saved.","The seeds on the rocky soil represent those who hear the message and receive it with joy. But since they don\u2019t have deep roots
 they believe for a while
 then they fall away when they face temptation.","The seeds that fell among the thorns represent those who hear the message
 but all too quickly the message is crowded out by the cares and riches and pleasures of this life. And so they never grow into maturity.","And the seeds that fell on the good soil represent honest
 good-hearted people who hear God\u2019s word
 cling to it
 and patiently produce a huge harvest.","\u201cNo one lights a lamp and then covers it with a bowl or hides it under a bed. A lamp is placed on a stand
 where its light can be seen by all who enter the house.","For all that is secret will eventually be brought into the open
 and everything that is concealed will be brought to light and made known to all.","\u201cSo pay attention to how you hear. To those who listen to my teaching
 more understanding will be given. But for those who are not listening
 even what they think they understand will be taken away from them.\u201d","Someone told Jesus
 \u201cYour mother and your brothers are standing outside
 and they want to see you.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cMy mother and my brothers are all those who hear God\u2019s word and obey it.\u201d","One day Jesus said to his disciples
 \u201cLet\u2019s cross to the other side of the lake.\u201d So they got into a boat and started out.","Then he asked them
 \u201cWhere is your faith?\u201d The disciples were terrified and amazed. \u201cWho is this man?\u201d they asked each other. \u201cWhen he gives a command
 even the wind and waves obey him!\u201d","Jesus demanded
 \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d \u201cLegion
\u201d he replied
 for he was filled with many demons.","\u201cNo
 go back to your family
 and tell them everything God has done for you.\u201d So he went all through the town proclaiming the great things Jesus had done for him.","\u201cWho touched me?\u201d Jesus asked. Everyone denied it
 and Peter said
 \u201cMaster
 this whole crowd is pressing up against you.\u201d","But Jesus said
 \u201cSomeone deliberately touched me
 for I felt healing power go out from me.\u201d","\u201cDaughter
\u201d he said to her
 \u201cyour faith has made you well. Go in peace.\u201d","But when Jesus heard what had happened
 he said to Jairus
 \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. Just have faith
 and she will be healed.\u201d","The house was filled with people weeping and wailing
 but he said
 \u201cStop the weeping! She isn\u2019t dead; she\u2019s only asleep.\u201d","Then Jesus took her by the hand and said in a loud voice
 \u201cMy child
 get up!\u201d","\u201cTake nothing for your journey
\u201d he instructed them. \u201cDon\u2019t take a walking stick
 a traveler\u2019s bag
 food
 money
 or even a change of clothes.","Wherever you go
 stay in the same house until you leave town.","And if a town refuses to welcome you
 shake its dust from your feet as you leave to show that you have abandoned those people to their fate.\u201d","But Jesus said
 \u201cYou feed them.\u201d \u201cBut we have only five loaves of bread and two fish
\u201d they answered. \u201cOr are you expecting us to go and buy enough food for this whole crowd?\u201d","For there were about 5
000 men there. Jesus replied
 \u201cTell them to sit down in groups of about fifty each.\u201d","One day Jesus left the crowds to pray alone. Only his disciples were with him
 and he asked them
 \u201cWho do people say I am?\u201d","Then he asked them
 \u201cBut who do you say I am?\u201d Peter replied
 \u201cYou are the Messiah sent from God!\u201d","\u201cThe Son of Man must suffer many terrible things
\u201d he said. \u201cHe will be rejected by the elders
 the leading priests
 and the teachers of religious law. He will be killed
 but on the third day he will be raised from the dead.\u201d","Then he said to the crowd
 \u201cIf any of you wants to be my follower
 you must give up your own way
 take up your cross daily
 and follow me.","If you try to hang on to your life
 you will lose it. But if you give up your life for my sake
 you will save it.","And what do you benefit if you gain the whole world but are yourself lost or destroyed?","If anyone is ashamed of me and my message
 the Son of Man will be ashamed of that person when he returns in his glory and in the glory of the Father and the holy angels.","I tell you the truth
 some standing here right now will not die before they see the Kingdom of God.\u201d","As Moses and Elijah were starting to leave
 Peter
 not even knowing what he was saying
 blurted out
 \u201cMaster
 it\u2019s wonderful for us to be here! Let\u2019s make three shelters as memorials\u2014one for you
 one for Moses
 and one for Elijah.\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cYou faithless and corrupt people! How long must I be with you and put up with you?\u201d Then he said to the man
 \u201cBring your son here.\u201d","\u201cListen to me and remember what I say. The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of his enemies.\u201d","Then he said to them
 \u201cAnyone who welcomes a little child like this on my behalf welcomes me
 and anyone who welcomes me also welcomes my Father who sent me. Whoever is the least among you is the greatest.\u201d","But Jesus said
 \u201cDon\u2019t stop him! Anyone who is not against you is for you.\u201d","But Jesus replied
 \u201cFoxes have dens to live in
 and birds have nests
 but the Son of Man has no place even to lay his head.\u201d","He said to another person
 \u201cCome
 follow me.\u201d The man agreed
 but he said
 \u201cLord
 first let me return home and bury my father.\u201d","But Jesus told him
 \u201cLet the spiritually dead bury their own dead! Your duty is to go and preach about the Kingdom of God.\u201d","But Jesus told him
 \u201cAnyone who puts a hand to the plow and then looks back is not fit for the Kingdom of God.\u201d","These were his instructions to them: \u201cThe harvest is great
 but the workers are few. So pray to the Lord who is in charge of the harvest; ask him to send more workers into his fields.","Now go
 and remember that I am sending you out as lambs among wolves.","Don\u2019t take any money with you
 nor a traveler\u2019s bag
 nor an extra pair of sandals. And don\u2019t stop to greet anyone on the road.","\u201cWhenever you enter someone\u2019s home
 first say
 \u2018May God\u2019s peace be on this house.\u2019","If those who live there are peaceful
 the blessing will stand; if they are not
 the blessing will return to you.","Don\u2019t move around from home to home. Stay in one place
 eating and drinking what they provide. Don\u2019t hesitate to accept hospitality
 because those who work deserve their pay.","\u201cIf you enter a town and it welcomes you
 eat whatever is set before you.","Heal the sick
 and tell them
 \u2018The Kingdom of God is near you now.\u2019","But if a town refuses to welcome you
 go out into its streets and say
","\u2018We wipe even the dust of your town from our feet to show that we have abandoned you to your fate. And know this\u2014the Kingdom of God is near!\u2019","I assure you
 even wicked Sodom will be better off than such a town on judgment day.","\u201cWhat sorrow awaits you
 Korazin and Bethsaida! For if the miracles I did in you had been done in wicked Tyre and Sidon
 their people would have repented of their sins long ago
 clothing themselves in burlap and throwing ashes on their heads to show their remorse.","Yes
 Tyre and Sidon will be better off on judgment day than you.","And you people of Capernaum
 will you be honored in heaven? No
 you will go down to the place of the dead.\u201d","Then he said to the disciples
 \u201cAnyone who accepts your message is also accepting me. And anyone who rejects you is rejecting me. And anyone who rejects me is rejecting God
 who sent me.\u201d","\u201cYes
\u201d he told them
 \u201cI saw Satan fall from heaven like lightning!","Look
 I have given you authority over all the power of the enemy
 and you can walk among snakes and scorpions and crush them. Nothing will injure you.","But don\u2019t rejoice because evil spirits obey you; rejoice because your names are registered in heaven.\u201d","At that same time Jesus was filled with the joy of the Holy Spirit
 and he said
 \u201cO Father
 Lord of heaven and earth
 thank you for hiding these things from those who think themselves wise and clever
 and for revealing them to the childlike. Yes
 Father
 it pleased you to do it this way.","\u201cMy Father has entrusted everything to me. No one truly knows the Son except the Father
 and no one truly knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.\u201d","Then when they were alone
 he turned to the disciples and said
 \u201cBlessed are the eyes that see what you have seen.","I tell you
 many prophets and kings longed to see what you see
 but they didn\u2019t see it. And they longed to hear what you hear
 but they didn\u2019t hear it.\u201d","One day an expert in religious law stood up to test Jesus by asking him this question: \u201cTeacher
 what should I do to inherit eternal life?\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cWhat does the law of Moses say? How do you read it?\u201d","\u201cRight!\u201d Jesus told him. \u201cDo this and you will live!\u201d","Jesus replied with a story: \u201cA Jewish man was traveling from Jerusalem down to Jericho
 and he was attacked by bandits. They stripped him of his clothes
 beat him up
 and left him half dead beside the road.","\u201cBy chance a priest came along. But when he saw the man lying there
 he crossed to the other side of the road and passed him by.","A Temple assistant walked over and looked at him lying there
 but he also passed by on the other side.","\u201cThen a despised Samaritan came along
 and when he saw the man
 he felt compassion for him.","Going over to him
 the Samaritan soothed his wounds with olive oil and wine and bandaged them. Then he put the man on his own donkey and took him to an inn
 where he took care of him.","The next day he handed the innkeeper two silver coins
 telling him
 \u2018Take care of this man. If his bill runs higher than this
 I\u2019ll pay you the next time I\u2019m here.\u2019","\u201cNow which of these three would you say was a neighbor to the man who was attacked by bandits?\u201d Jesus asked.","The man replied
 \u201cThe one who showed him mercy.\u201d Then Jesus said
 \u201cYes
 now go and do the same.\u201d","But the Lord said to her
 \u201cMy dear Martha
 you are worried and upset over all these details!","There is only one thing worth being concerned about. Mary has discovered it
 and it will not be taken away from her.\u201d","Once Jesus was in a certain place praying. As he finished
 one of his disciples came to him and said
 \u201cLord
 teach us to pray
 just as John taught his disciples.\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cThis is how you should pray: \u201cFather
 may your name be kept holy. May your Kingdom come soon.","Give us each day the food we need
","and forgive us our sins
 as we forgive those who sin against us. And don\u2019t let us yield to temptation.\u201d","Then
 teaching them more about prayer
 he used this story: \u201cSuppose you went to a friend\u2019s house at midnight
 wanting to borrow three loaves of bread. You say to him
","\u2018A friend of mine has just arrived for a visit
 and I have nothing for him to eat.\u2019","And suppose he calls out from his bedroom
 \u2018Don\u2019t bother me. The door is locked for the night
 and my family and I are all in bed. I can\u2019t help you.\u2019","But I tell you this\u2014though he won\u2019t do it for friendship\u2019s sake
 if you keep knocking long enough
 he will get up and give you whatever you need because of your shameless persistence.","\u201cAnd so I tell you
 keep on asking
 and you will receive what you ask for. Keep on seeking
 and you will find. Keep on knocking
 and the door will be opened to you.","For everyone who asks
 receives. Everyone who seeks
 finds. And to everyone who knocks
 the door will be opened.","\u201cYou fathers\u2014if your children ask for a fish
 do you give them a snake instead?","Or if they ask for an egg
 do you give them a scorpion? Of course not!","So if you sinful people know how to give good gifts to your children
 how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him.\u201d","One day Jesus cast out a demon from a man who couldn\u2019t speak
 and when the demon was gone
 the man began to speak. The crowds were amazed
","He knew their thoughts
 so he said
 \u201cAny kingdom divided by civil war is doomed. A family splintered by feuding will fall apart.","You say I am empowered by Satan. But if Satan is divided and fighting against himself
 how can his kingdom survive?","And if I am empowered by Satan
 what about your own exorcists? They cast out demons
 too
 so they will condemn you for what you have said.","But if I am casting out demons by the power of God
 then the Kingdom of God has arrived among you.","For when a strong man is fully armed and guards his palace
 his possessions are safe\u2014","until someone even stronger attacks and overpowers him
 strips him of his weapons
 and carries off his belongings.","\u201cAnyone who isn\u2019t with me opposes me
 and anyone who isn\u2019t working with me is actually working against me.","\u201cWhen an evil spirit leaves a person
 it goes into the desert
 searching for rest. But when it finds none
 it says
 \u2018I will return to the person I came from.\u2019","So it returns and finds that its former home is all swept and in order.","Then the spirit finds seven other spirits more evil than itself
 and they all enter the person and live there. And so that person is worse off than before.\u201d","As he was speaking
 a woman in the crowd called out
 \u201cGod bless your mother\u2014the womb from which you came
 and the breasts that nursed you!\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cBut even more blessed are all who hear the word of God and put it into practice.\u201d","As the crowd pressed in on Jesus
 he said
 \u201cThis evil generation keeps asking me to show them a miraculous sign. But the only sign I will give them is the sign of Jonah.","What happened to him was a sign to the people of Nineveh that God had sent him. What happens to the Son of Man will be a sign to these people that he was sent by God.","\u201cThe queen of Sheba will stand up against this generation on judgment day and condemn it
 for she came from a distant land to hear the wisdom of Solomon. Now someone greater than Solomon is here\u2014but you refuse to listen.","The people of Nineveh will also stand up against this generation on judgment day and condemn it
 for they repented of their sins at the preaching of Jonah. Now someone greater than Jonah is here\u2014but you refuse to repent.","\u201cNo one lights a lamp and then hides it or puts it under a basket. Instead
 a lamp is placed on a stand
 where its light can be seen by all who enter the house.","\u201cYour eye is like a lamp that provides light for your body. When your eye is healthy
 your whole body is filled with light. But when it is unhealthy
 your body is filled with darkness.","Make sure that the light you think you have is not actually darkness.","If you are filled with light
 with no dark corners
 then your whole life will be radiant
 as though a floodlight were filling you with light.\u201d","Then the Lord said to him
 \u201cYou Pharisees are so careful to clean the outside of the cup and the dish
 but inside you are filthy\u2014full of greed and wickedness!","Fools! Didn\u2019t God make the inside as well as the outside?","So clean the inside by giving gifts to the poor
 and you will be clean all over.","\u201cWhat sorrow awaits you Pharisees! For you are careful to tithe even the tiniest income from your herb gardens
 but you ignore justice and the love of God. You should tithe
 yes
 but do not neglect the more important things.","\u201cWhat sorrow awaits you Pharisees! For you love to sit in the seats of honor in the synagogues and receive respectful greetings as you walk in the marketplaces.","Yes
 what sorrow awaits you! For you are like hidden graves in a field. People walk over them without knowing the corruption they are stepping on.\u201d","\u201cYes
\u201d said Jesus
 \u201cwhat sorrow also awaits you experts in religious law! For you crush people with unbearable religious demands
 and you never lift a finger to ease the burden.","What sorrow awaits you! For you build monuments for the prophets your own ancestors killed long ago.","But in fact
 you stand as witnesses who agree with what your ancestors did. They killed the prophets
 and you join in their crime by building the monuments!","This is what God in his wisdom said about you: \u2018I will send prophets and apostles to them
 but they will kill some and persecute the others.\u2019","\u201cAs a result
 this generation will be held responsible for the murder of all God\u2019s prophets from the creation of the world\u2014","from the murder of Abel to the murder of Zechariah
 who was killed between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes
 it will certainly be charged against this generation.","\u201cWhat sorrow awaits you experts in religious law! For you remove the key to knowledge from the people. You don\u2019t enter the Kingdom yourselves
 and you prevent others from entering.\u201d","Meanwhile
 the crowds grew until thousands were milling about and stepping on each other. Jesus turned first to his disciples and warned them
 \u201cBeware of the yeast of the Pharisees\u2014their hypocrisy.","The time is coming when everything that is covered up will be revealed
 and all that is secret will be made known to all.","Whatever you have said in the dark will be heard in the light
 and what you have whispered behind closed doors will be shouted from the housetops for all to hear!","\u201cDear friends
 don\u2019t be afraid of those who want to kill your body; they cannot do any more to you after that.","But I\u2019ll tell you whom to fear. Fear God
 who has the power to kill you and then throw you into hell. Yes
 he\u2019s the one to fear.","\u201cWhat is the price of five sparrows\u2014two copper coins? Yet God does not forget a single one of them.","And the very hairs on your head are all numbered.

 everyone who acknowledges me publicly here on earth
 the Son of Man will also acknowledge in the presence of God\u2019s angels.","But anyone who denies me here on earth will be denied before God\u2019s angels.","Anyone who speaks against the Son of Man can be forgiven
 but anyone who blasphemes the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.","\u201cAnd when you are brought to trial in the synagogues and before rulers and authorities
 don\u2019t worry about how to defend yourself or what to say
","for the Holy Spirit will teach you at that time what needs to be said.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cFriend
 who made me a judge over you to decide such things as that?\u201d","Then he said
 \u201cBeware! Guard against every kind of greed. Life is not measured by how much you own.\u201d","Then he told them a story: \u201cA rich man had a fertile farm that produced fine crops.","He said to himself
 \u2018What should I do? I don\u2019t have room for all my crops.\u2019","Then he said
 \u2018I know! I\u2019ll tear down my barns and build bigger ones. Then I\u2019ll have room enough to store all my wheat and other goods.","And I\u2019ll sit back and say to myself
 \u201cMy friend
 you have enough stored away for years to come. Now take it easy! Eat
 drink
 and be merry!\u201d\u2019","\u201cBut God said to him
 \u2018You fool! You will die this very night. Then who will get everything you worked for?\u2019","\u201cYes
 a person is a fool to store up earthly wealth but not have a rich relationship with God.\u201d","Then
 turning to his disciples
 Jesus said
 \u201cThat is why I tell you not to worry about everyday life\u2014whether you have enough food to eat or enough clothes to wear.","For life is more than food
 and your body more than clothing.","Look at the ravens. They don\u2019t plant or harvest or store food in barns
 for God feeds them. And you are far more valuable to him than any birds!","Can all your worries add a single moment to your life?","And if worry can\u2019t accomplish a little thing like that
 what\u2019s the use of worrying over bigger things?","\u201cLook at the lilies and how they grow. They don\u2019t work or make their clothing
 yet Solomon in all his glory was not dressed as beautifully as they are.","And if God cares so wonderfully for flowers that are here today and thrown into the fire tomorrow
 he will certainly care for you. Why do you have so little faith?","\u201cAnd don\u2019t be concerned about what to eat and what to drink. Don\u2019t worry about such things.","These things dominate the thoughts of unbelievers all over the world
 but your Father already knows your needs.","Seek the Kingdom of God above all else
 and he will give you everything you need.","\u201cSo don\u2019t be afraid
 little flock. For it gives your Father great happiness to give you the Kingdom.","\u201cSell your possessions and give to those in need. This will store up treasure for you in heaven! And the purses of heaven never get old or develop holes. Your treasure will be safe; no thief can steal it and no moth can destroy it.","Wherever your treasure is
 there the desires of your heart will also be.","\u201cBe dressed for service and keep your lamps burning
","as though you were waiting for your master to return from the wedding feast. Then you will be ready to open the door and let him in the moment he arrives and knocks.","The servants who are ready and waiting for his return will be rewarded. I tell you the truth
 he himself will seat them
 put on an apron
 and serve them as they sit and eat!","He may come in the middle of the night or just before dawn. But whenever he comes
 he will reward the servants who are ready.","\u201cUnderstand this: If a homeowner knew exactly when a burglar was coming
 he would not permit his house to be broken into.","You also must be ready all the time
 for the Son of Man will come when least expected.\u201d","And the Lord replied
 \u201cA faithful
 sensible servant is one to whom the master can give the responsibility of managing his other household servants and feeding them.","If the master returns and finds that the servant has done a good job
 there will be a reward.","I tell you the truth
 the master will put that servant in charge of all he owns.","But what if the servant thinks
 \u2018My master won\u2019t be back for a while
\u2019 and he begins beating the other servants
 partying
 and getting drunk?","The master will return unannounced and unexpected
 and he will cut the servant in pieces and banish him with the unfaithful.","\u201cAnd a servant who knows what the master wants
 but isn\u2019t prepared and doesn\u2019t carry out those instructions
 will be severely punished.","But someone who does not know
 and then does something wrong
 will be punished only lightly. When someone has been given much
 much will be required in return; and when someone has been entrusted with much
 even more will be required.","\u201cI have come to set the world on fire
 and I wish it were already burning!","I have a terrible baptism of suffering ahead of me
 and I am under a heavy burden until it is accomplished.","Do you think I have come to bring peace to the earth? No
 I have come to divide people against each other!","From now on families will be split apart
 three in favor of me
 and two against\u2014or two in favor and three against.","\u2018Father will be divided against son and son against father; mother against daughter and daughter against mother; and mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.\u2019\u201d","Then Jesus turned to the crowd and said
 \u201cWhen you see clouds beginning to form in the west

 \u2018Today will be a scorcher.\u2019 And it is.","You fools! You know how to interpret the weather signs of the earth and sky

 you won\u2019t be free again until you have paid the very last penny.\u201d","\u201cDo you think those Galileans were worse sinners than all the other people from Galilee?\u201d Jesus asked. \u201cIs that why they suffered?","Not at all! And you will perish
 too

 you will perish
 too.\u201d","Then Jesus told this story: \u201cA man planted a fig tree in his garden and came again and again to see if there was any fruit on it
 but he was always disappointed.","Finally
 he said to his gardener
 \u2018I\u2019ve waited three years
 and there hasn\u2019t been a single fig! Cut it down. It\u2019s just taking up space in the garden.\u2019","\u201cThe gardener answered
 \u2018Sir
 give it one more chance. Leave it another year
 and I\u2019ll give it special attention and plenty of fertilizer.","If we get figs next year
 fine. If not
 then you can cut it down.\u2019\u201d","When Jesus saw her
 he called her over and said
 \u201cDear woman
 you are healed of your sickness!\u201d","But the Lord replied
 \u201cYou hypocrites! Each of you works on the Sabbath day! Don\u2019t you untie your ox or your donkey from its stall on the Sabbath and lead it out for water?","This dear woman
 a daughter of Abraham
 has been held in bondage by Satan for eighteen years. Isn\u2019t it right that she be released
 even on the Sabbath?\u201d","Then Jesus said
 \u201cWhat is the Kingdom of God like? How can I illustrate it?","It is like a tiny mustard seed that a man planted in a garden; it grows and becomes a tree
 and the birds make nests in its branches.\u201d","He also asked
 \u201cWhat else is the Kingdom of God like?","It is like the yeast a woman used in making bread. Even though she put only a little yeast in three measures of flour
 it permeated every part of the dough.\u201d","Someone asked him
 \u201cLord
 will only a few be saved?\u201d He replied
","\u201cWork hard to enter the narrow door to God\u2019s Kingdom
 for many will try to enter but will fail.","When the master of the house has locked the door
 it will be too late. You will stand outside knocking and pleading
 \u2018Lord
 open the door for us!\u2019 But he will reply
 \u2018I don\u2019t know you or where you come from.\u2019","Then you will say
 \u2018But we ate and drank with you
 and you taught in our streets.\u2019","And he will reply
 \u2018I tell you
 I don\u2019t know you or where you come from. Get away from me
 all you who do evil.\u2019","\u201cThere will be weeping and gnashing of teeth
 for you will see Abraham
 Isaac
 Jacob
 and all the prophets in the Kingdom of God
 but you will be thrown out.","And people will come from all over the world\u2014from east and west
 north and south\u2014to take their places in the Kingdom of God.","And note this: Some who seem least important now will be the greatest then
 and some who are the greatest now will be least important then.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cGo tell that fox that I will keep on casting out demons and healing people today and tomorrow; and the third day I will accomplish my purpose.","Yes
 today
 tomorrow
 and the next day I must proceed on my way. For it wouldn\u2019t do for a prophet of God to be killed except in Jerusalem!","\u201cO Jerusalem
 Jerusalem
 the city that kills the prophets and stones God\u2019s messengers! How often I have wanted to gather your children together as a hen protects her chicks beneath her wings
 but you wouldn\u2019t let me.","And now
 look
 your house is abandoned. And you will never see me again until you say
 \u2018Blessings on the one who comes in the name of the Lord!\u2019\u201d","Jesus asked the Pharisees and experts in religious law
 \u201cIs it permitted in the law to heal people on the Sabbath day
 or not?\u201d","Then he turned to them and said
 \u201cWhich of you doesn\u2019t work on the Sabbath? If your son or your cow falls into a pit
 don\u2019t you rush to get him out?\u201d","\u201cWhen you are invited to a wedding feast
 don\u2019t sit in the seat of honor. What if someone who is more distinguished than you has also been invited?","The host will come and say
 \u2018Give this person your seat.\u2019 Then you will be embarrassed
 and you will have to take whatever seat is left at the foot of the table!","\u201cInstead
 take the lowest place at the foot of the table. Then when your host sees you
 he will come and say
 \u2018Friend
 we have a better place for you!\u2019 Then you will be honored in front of all the other guests.","For those who exalt themselves will be humbled
 and those who humble themselves will be exalted.\u201d","Then he turned to his host. \u201cWhen you put on a luncheon or a banquet
\u201d he said
 \u201cdon\u2019t invite your friends
 brothers
 relatives
 and rich neighbors. For they will invite you back
 and that will be your only reward.","Instead
 invite the poor
 the crippled
 the lame
 and the blind.","Then at the resurrection of the righteous
 God will reward you for inviting those who could not repay you.\u201d","Hearing this
 a man sitting at the table with Jesus exclaimed
 \u201cWhat a blessing it will be to attend a banquet in the Kingdom of God!\u201d","Jesus replied with this story: \u201cA man prepared a great feast and sent out many invitations.","When the banquet was ready
 he sent his servant to tell the guests
 \u2018Come
 the banquet is ready.\u2019","But they all began making excuses. One said
 \u2018I have just bought a field and must inspect it. Please excuse me.\u2019","Another said
 \u2018I have just bought five pairs of oxen
 and I want to try them out. Please excuse me.\u2019","Another said
 \u2018I just got married
 so I can\u2019t come.\u2019","\u201cThe servant returned and told his master what they had said. His master was furious and said
 \u2018Go quickly into the streets and alleys of the town and invite the poor
 the crippled
 the blind
 and the lame.\u2019","After the servant had done this
 he reported
 \u2018There is still room for more.\u2019","So his master said
 \u2018Go out into the country lanes and behind the hedges and urge anyone you find to come
 so that the house will be full.","For none of those I first invited will get even the smallest taste of my banquet.\u2019\u201d","A large crowd was following Jesus. He turned around and said to them
","\u201cIf you want to be my disciple
 you must
 by comparison
 hate everyone else\u2014your father and mother
 wife and children
 brothers and sisters\u2014yes
 even your own life. Otherwise
 you cannot be my disciple.","And if you do not carry your own cross and follow me
 you cannot be my disciple.","\u201cBut don\u2019t begin until you count the cost. For who would begin construction of a building without first calculating the cost to see if there is enough money to finish it?","Otherwise
 you might complete only the foundation before running out of money
 and then everyone would laugh at you.","They would say
 \u2018There\u2019s the person who started that building and couldn\u2019t afford to finish it!\u2019","\u201cOr what king would go to war against another king without first sitting down with his counselors to discuss whether his army of 10
000 could defeat the 20
000 soldiers marching against him?","And if he can\u2019t
 he will send a delegation to discuss terms of peace while the enemy is still far away.","So you cannot become my disciple without giving up everything you own.","\u201cSalt is good for seasoning. But if it loses its flavor
 how do you make it salty again?","Flavorless salt is good neither for the soil nor for the manure pile. It is thrown away. Anyone with ears to hear should listen and understand!\u201d","\u201cIf a man has a hundred sheep and one of them gets lost
 what will he do? Won\u2019t he leave the ninety-nine others in the wilderness and go to search for the one that is lost until he finds it?","And when he has found it
 he will joyfully carry it home on his shoulders.","When he arrives
 he will call together his friends and neighbors
 saying
 \u2018Rejoice with me because I have found my lost sheep.\u2019","In the same way
 there is more joy in heaven over one lost sinner who repents and returns to God than over ninety-nine others who are righteous and haven\u2019t strayed away!","\u201cOr suppose a woman has ten silver coins and loses one. Won\u2019t she light a lamp and sweep the entire house and search carefully until she finds it?","And when she finds it
 she will call in her friends and neighbors and say
 \u2018Rejoice with me because I have found my lost coin.\u2019","In the same way
 there is joy in the presence of God\u2019s angels when even one sinner repents.\u201d","To illustrate the point further
 Jesus told them this story: \u201cA man had two sons.","The younger son told his father
 \u2018I want my share of your estate now before you die.\u2019 So his father agreed to divide his wealth between his sons.","\u201cA few days later this younger son packed all his belongings and moved to a distant land
 and there he wasted all his money in wild living.","About the time his money ran out
 a great famine swept over the land
 and he began to starve.","He persuaded a local farmer to hire him
 and the man sent him into his fields to feed the pigs.","The young man became so hungry that even the pods he was feeding the pigs looked good to him. But no one gave him anything.","\u201cWhen he finally came to his senses
 he said to himself
 \u2018At home even the hired servants have food enough to spare
 and here I am dying of hunger!","I will go home to my father and say
 \u201cFather
 I have sinned against both heaven and you
","and I am no longer worthy of being called your son. Please take me on as a hired servant.\u201d\u2019","\u201cSo he returned home to his father. And while he was still a long way off
 his father saw him coming. Filled with love and compassion
 he ran to his son
 embraced him
 and kissed him.","His son said to him
 \u2018Father
 I have sinned against both heaven and you
 and I am no longer worthy of being called your son.\u2019","\u201cBut his father said to the servants
 \u2018Quick! Bring the finest robe in the house and put it on him. Get a ring for his finger and sandals for his feet.","And kill the calf we have been fattening. We must celebrate with a feast
","for this son of mine was dead and has now returned to life. He was lost
 but now he is found.\u2019 So the party began.","\u201cMeanwhile
 the older son was in the fields working. When he returned home
 he heard music and dancing in the house
","and he asked one of the servants what was going on.","\u2018Your brother is back
\u2019 he was told
 \u2018and your father has killed the fattened calf. We are celebrating because of his safe return.\u2019","\u201cThe older brother was angry and wouldn\u2019t go in. His father came out and begged him
","but he replied
 \u2018All these years I\u2019ve slaved for you and never once refused to do a single thing you told me to. And in all that time you never gave me even one young goat for a feast with my friends.","Yet when this son of yours comes back after squandering your money on prostitutes
 you celebrate by killing the fattened calf!\u2019","\u201cHis father said to him
 \u2018Look
 dear son
 you have always stayed by me
 and everything I have is yours.","We had to celebrate this happy day. For your brother was dead and has come back to life! He was lost
 but now he is found!\u2019\u201d","Jesus told this story to his disciples: \u201cThere was a certain rich man who had a manager handling his affairs. One day a report came that the manager was wasting his employer\u2019s money.","So the employer called him in and said
 \u2018What\u2019s this I hear about you? Get your report in order
 because you are going to be fired.\u2019","\u201cThe manager thought to himself
 \u2018Now what? My boss has fired me. I don\u2019t have the strength to dig ditches
 and I\u2019m too proud to beg.","Ah
 I know how to ensure that I\u2019ll have plenty of friends who will give me a home when I am fired.\u2019","\u201cSo he invited each person who owed money to his employer to come and discuss the situation. He asked the first one
 \u2018How much do you owe him?\u2019","The man replied
 \u2018I owe him 800 gallons of olive oil.\u2019 So the manager told him
 \u2018Take the bill and quickly change it to 400 gallons.\u2019","\u201c\u2018And how much do you owe my employer?\u2019 he asked the next man. \u2018I owe him 1
000 bushels of wheat
\u2019 was the reply. \u2018Here
\u2019 the manager said
 \u2018take the bill and change it to 800 bushels.\u2019","\u201cThe rich man had to admire the dishonest rascal for being so shrewd. And it is true that the children of this world are more shrewd in dealing with the world around them than are the children of the light.","Here\u2019s the lesson: Use your worldly resources to benefit others and make friends. Then
 when your possessions are gone
 they will welcome you to an eternal home.","\u201cIf you are faithful in little things
 you will be faithful in large ones. But if you are dishonest in little things
 you won\u2019t be honest with greater responsibilities.","And if you are untrustworthy about worldly wealth
 who will trust you with the true riches of heaven?","And if you are not faithful with other people\u2019s things
 why should you be trusted with things of your own?","\u201cNo one can serve two masters. For you will hate one and love the other; you will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and be enslaved to money.\u201d","Then he said to them
 \u201cYou like to appear righteous in public
 but God knows your hearts. What this world honors is detestable in the sight of God.","\u201cUntil John the Baptist
 the law of Moses and the messages of the prophets were your guides. But now the Good News of the Kingdom of God is preached
 and everyone is eager to get in.","But that doesn\u2019t mean that the law has lost its force. It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the smallest point of God\u2019s law to be overturned.","\u201cFor example
 a man who divorces his wife and marries someone else commits adultery. And anyone who marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery.\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cThere was a certain rich man who was splendidly clothed in purple and fine linen and who lived each day in luxury.","At his gate lay a poor man named Lazarus who was covered with sores.","As Lazarus lay there longing for scraps from the rich man\u2019s table
 the dogs would come and lick his open sores.","\u201cFinally
 the poor man died and was carried by the angels to sit beside Abraham at the heavenly banquet. The rich man also died and was buried
","and he went to the place of the dead. There
 in torment
 he saw Abraham in the far distance with Lazarus at his side.","\u201cThe rich man shouted
 \u2018Father Abraham
 have some pity! Send Lazarus over here to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue. I am in anguish in these flames.\u2019","\u201cBut Abraham said to him
 \u2018Son
 remember that during your lifetime you had everything you wanted
 and Lazarus had nothing. So now he is here being comforted
 and you are in anguish.","And besides
 there is a great chasm separating us. No one can cross over to you from here
 and no one can cross over to us from there.\u2019","\u201cThen the rich man said
 \u2018Please
 Father Abraham
 at least send him to my father\u2019s home.","For I have five brothers
 and I want him to warn them so they don\u2019t end up in this place of torment.\u2019","\u201cBut Abraham said
 \u2018Moses and the prophets have warned them. Your brothers can read what they wrote.\u2019","\u201cThe rich man replied
 \u2018No
 Father Abraham! But if someone is sent to them from the dead
 then they will repent of their sins and turn to God.\u2019","\u201cBut Abraham said
 \u2018If they won\u2019t listen to Moses and the prophets
 they won\u2019t be persuaded even if someone rises from the dead.\u2019\u201d","One day Jesus said to his disciples
 \u201cThere will always be temptations to sin
 but what sorrow awaits the person who does the tempting!","It would be better to be thrown into the sea with a millstone hung around your neck than to cause one of these little ones to fall into sin.","So watch yourselves! \u201cIf another believer sins
 rebuke that person; then if there is repentance
 forgive.","Even if that person wrongs you seven times a day and each time turns again and asks forgiveness
 you must forgive.\u201d","The Lord answered
 \u201cIf you had faith even as small as a mustard seed
 you could say to this mulberry tree
 \u2018May you be uprooted and be planted in the sea
\u2019 and it would obey you!","\u201cWhen a servant comes in from plowing or taking care of sheep
 does his master say
 \u2018Come in and eat with me\u2019?","No
 he says
 \u2018Prepare my meal
 put on your apron
 and serve me while I eat. Then you can eat later.\u2019","And does the master thank the servant for doing what he was told to do? Of course not.","In the same way
 when you obey me you should say
 \u2018We are unworthy servants who have simply done our duty.\u2019\u201d","As Jesus continued on toward Jerusalem
 he reached the border between Galilee and Samaria.","He looked at them and said
 \u201cGo show yourselves to the priests.\u201d And as they went
 they were cleansed of their leprosy.","Jesus asked
 \u201cDidn\u2019t I heal ten men? Where are the other nine?","Has no one returned to give glory to God except this foreigner?\u201d","And Jesus said to the man
 \u201cStand up and go. Your faith has healed you.\u201d","One day the Pharisees asked Jesus
 \u201cWhen will the Kingdom of God come?\u201d Jesus replied
 \u201cThe Kingdom of God can\u2019t be detected by visible signs.","You won\u2019t be able to say
 \u2018Here it is!\u2019 or \u2018It\u2019s over there!\u2019 For the Kingdom of God is already among you.\u201d","Then he said to his disciples
 \u201cThe time is coming when you will long to see the day when the Son of Man returns
 but you won\u2019t see it.","People will tell you
 \u2018Look
 there is the Son of Man
\u2019 or \u2018Here he is
\u2019 but don\u2019t go out and follow them.","For as the lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one end to the other
 so it will be on the day when the Son of Man comes.","But first the Son of Man must suffer terribly and be rejected by this generation.","\u201cWhen the Son of Man returns
 it will be like it was in Noah\u2019s day.","In those days
 the people enjoyed banquets and parties and weddings right up to the time Noah entered his boat and the flood came and destroyed them all.","\u201cAnd the world will be as it was in the days of Lot. People went about their daily business\u2014eating and drinking
 buying and selling
 farming and building\u2014","until the morning Lot left Sodom. Then fire and burning sulfur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all.","Yes
 it will be \u2018business as usual\u2019 right up to the day when the Son of Man is revealed.","On that day a person out on the deck of a roof must not go down into the house to pack. A person out in the field must not return home.","Remember what happened to Lot\u2019s wife!","If you cling to your life
 you will lose it
 and if you let your life go
 you will save it.","That night two people will be asleep in one bed; one will be taken
 the other left.","Two women will be grinding flour together at the mill; one will be taken
 the other left.\u201d","\u201cWhere will this happen
 Lord?\u201d the disciples asked. Jesus replied
 \u201cJust as the gathering of vultures shows there is a carcass nearby
 so these signs indicate that the end is near.\u201d","\u201cThere was a judge in a certain city
\u201d he said
 \u201cwho neither feared God nor cared about people.","A widow of that city came to him repeatedly
 saying
 \u2018Give me justice in this dispute with my enemy.\u2019","The judge ignored her for a while
 but finally he said to himself
 \u2018I don\u2019t fear God or care about people
","but this woman is driving me crazy. I\u2019m going to see that she gets justice
 because she is wearing me out with her constant requests!\u2019\u201d","Then the Lord said
 \u201cLearn a lesson from this unjust judge.","Even he rendered a just decision in the end. So don\u2019t you think God will surely give justice to his chosen people who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off?","I tell you
 he will grant justice to them quickly! But when the Son of Man returns
 how many will he find on the earth who have faith?\u201d","\u201cTwo men went to the Temple to pray. One was a Pharisee
 and the other was a despised tax collector.","The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed this prayer: \u2018I thank you
 God
 that I am not like other people\u2014cheaters
 sinners
 adulterers. I\u2019m certainly not like that tax collector!","I fast twice a week
 and I give you a tenth of my income.\u2019","\u201cBut the tax collector stood at a distance and dared not even lift his eyes to heaven as he prayed. Instead
 he beat his chest in sorrow
 saying
 \u2018O God
 be merciful to me
 for I am a sinner.\u2019","I tell you
 this sinner
 not the Pharisee
 returned home justified before God. For those who exalt themselves will be humbled
 and those who humble themselves will be exalted.\u201d","Then Jesus called for the children and said to the disciples
 \u201cLet the children come to me. Don\u2019t stop them! For the Kingdom of God belongs to those who are like these children.","I tell you the truth
 anyone who doesn\u2019t receive the Kingdom of God like a child will never enter it.\u201d","\u201cWhy do you call me good?\u201d Jesus asked him. \u201cOnly God is truly good.","But to answer your question
 you know the commandments: \u2018You must not commit adultery. You must not murder. You must not steal. You must not testify falsely. Honor your father and mother.\u2019\u201d","The man replied
 \u201cI\u2019ve obeyed all these commandments since I was young.\u201d","When Jesus heard his answer
 he said
 \u201cThere is still one thing you haven\u2019t done. Sell all your possessions and give the money to the poor
 and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come
 follow me.\u201d","When Jesus saw this
 he said
 \u201cHow hard it is for the rich to enter the Kingdom of God!","In fact
 it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the Kingdom of God!\u201d","He replied
 \u201cWhat is impossible for people is possible with God.\u201d","\u201cYes
\u201d Jesus replied
 \u201cand I assure you that everyone who has given up house or wife or brothers or parents or children
 for the sake of the Kingdom of God
","will be repaid many times over in this life
 and will have eternal life in the world to come.\u201d","Taking the twelve disciples aside
 Jesus said
 \u201cListen
 we\u2019re going up to Jerusalem

 and he will be mocked
 treated shamefully
 and spit upon.","They will flog him with a whip and kill him
 but on the third day he will rise again.\u201d","But they didn\u2019t understand any of this. The significance of his words was hidden from them
 and they failed to grasp what he was talking about.","\u201cWhat do you want me to do for you?\u201d \u201cLord
\u201d he said
 \u201cI want to see!\u201d","And Jesus said
 \u201cAll right
 receive your sight! Your faith has healed you.\u201d","When Jesus came by
 he looked up at Zacchaeus and called him by name. \u201cZacchaeus!\u201d he said. \u201cQuick
 come down! I must be a guest in your home today.\u201d","Meanwhile
 Zacchaeus stood before the Lord and said
 \u201cI will give half my wealth to the poor
 Lord

 I will give them back four times as much!\u201d","Jesus responded
 \u201cSalvation has come to this home today

 \u201cA nobleman was called away to a distant empire to be crowned king and then return.","Before he left
 he called together ten of his servants and divided among them ten pounds of silver

 \u2018Invest this for me while I am gone.\u2019","But his people hated him and sent a delegation after him to say
 \u2018We do not want him to be our king.\u2019","\u201cAfter he was crowned king
 he returned and called in the servants to whom he had given the money. He wanted to find out what their profits were.","The first servant reported

 so you will be governor of ten cities as your reward.\u2019","\u201cThe next servant reported
 \u2018Master
 I invested your money and made five times the original amount.\u2019","\u201c\u2018Well done!\u2019 the king said. \u2018You will be governor over five cities.\u2019","\u201cBut the third servant brought back only the original amount of money and said
 \u2018Master

 taking what isn\u2019t yours and harvesting crops you didn\u2019t plant.\u2019","\u201c\u2018You wicked servant!\u2019 the king roared. \u2018Your own words condemn you. If you knew that I\u2019m a hard man who takes what isn\u2019t mine and harvests crops I didn\u2019t plant
","why didn\u2019t you deposit my money in the bank? At least I could have gotten some interest on it.\u2019","\u201cThen
 turning to the others standing nearby
 the king ordered
 \u2018Take the money from this servant

 \u2018and to those who use well what they are given
 even more will be given. But from those who do nothing
 even what little they have will be taken away.","And as for these enemies of mine who didn\u2019t want me to be their king\u2014bring them in and execute them right here in front of me.\u2019\u201d","\u201cGo into that village over there

 because you did not recognize it when God visited you.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cThe Scriptures declare
 \u2018My Temple will be a house of prayer
\u2019 but you have turned it into a den of thieves.\u201d","\u201cLet me ask you a question first
\u201d he replied.","\u201cDid John\u2019s authority to baptize come from heaven
 or was it merely human?\u201d","And Jesus responded
 \u201cThen I won\u2019t tell you by what authority I do these things.\u201d","Now Jesus turned to the people again and told them this story: \u201cA man planted a vineyard
 leased it to tenant farmers
 and moved to another country to live for several years.","At the time of the grape harvest
 he sent one of his servants to collect his share of the crop. But the farmers attacked the servant
 beat him up
 and sent him back empty-handed.","So the owner sent another servant
 but they also insulted him
 beat him up
 and sent him away empty-handed.","A third man was sent
 and they wounded him and chased him away.","\u201c\u2018What will I do?\u2019 the owner asked himself. \u2018I know! I\u2019ll send my cherished son. Surely they will respect him.\u2019","\u201cBut when the tenant farmers saw his son
 they said to each other
 \u2018Here comes the heir to this estate. Let\u2019s kill him and get the estate for ourselves!\u2019","So they dragged him out of the vineyard and murdered him. \u201cWhat do you suppose the owner of the vineyard will do to them?\u201d Jesus asked.","\u201cI\u2019ll tell you\u2014he will come and kill those farmers and lease the vineyard to others.\u201d \u201cHow terrible that such a thing should ever happen
\u201d his listeners protested.","Jesus looked at them and said
 \u201cThen what does this Scripture mean? \u2018The stone that the builders rejected has now become the cornerstone.\u2019","Everyone who stumbles over that stone will be broken to pieces
 and it will crush anyone it falls on.\u201d","Watching for their opportunity
 the leaders sent spies pretending to be honest men. They tried to get Jesus to say something that could be reported to the Roman governor so he would arrest Jesus.","\u201cShow me a Roman coin. Whose picture and title are stamped on it?\u201d \u201cCaesar\u2019s
\u201d they replied.","\u201cWell then
\u201d he said
 \u201cgive to Caesar what belongs to Caesar
 and give to God what belongs to God.\u201d","So they failed to trap him by what he said in front of the people. Instead
 they were amazed by his answer
 and they became silent.","Jesus replied
 \u201cMarriage is for people here on earth.","But in the age to come
 those worthy of being raised from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage.","And they will never die again. In this respect they will be like angels. They are children of God and children of the resurrection.","\u201cBut now
 as to whether the dead will be raised\u2014even Moses proved this when he wrote about the burning bush. Long after Abraham
 Isaac
 and Jacob had died
 he referred to the Lord as \u2018the God of Abraham
 the God of Isaac
 and the God of Jacob.\u2019","So he is the God of the living
 not the dead
 for they are all alive to him.\u201d","Then Jesus presented them with a question. \u201cWhy is it
\u201d he asked
 \u201cthat the Messiah is said to be the son of David?","For David himself wrote in the book of Psalms: \u2018The Lord said to my Lord
 Sit in the place of honor at my right hand","until I humble your enemies
 making them a footstool under your feet.\u2019","Since David called the Messiah \u2018Lord
\u2019 how can the Messiah be his son?\u201d","\u201cBeware of these teachers of religious law! For they like to parade around in flowing robes and love to receive respectful greetings as they walk in the marketplaces. And how they love the seats of honor in the synagogues and the head table at banquets.","Yet they shamelessly cheat widows out of their property and then pretend to be pious by making long prayers in public. Because of this
 they will be severely punished.\u201d","\u201cI tell you the truth
\u201d Jesus said
 \u201cthis poor widow has given more than all the rest of them.","For they have given a tiny part of their surplus
 but she
 poor as she is
 has given everything she has.\u201d","\u201cThe time is coming when all these things will be completely demolished. Not one stone will be left on top of another!\u201d","He replied
 \u201cDon\u2019t let anyone mislead you
 for many will come in my name
 claiming
 \u2018I am the Messiah
\u2019 and saying
 \u2018The time has come!\u2019 But don\u2019t believe them.","And when you hear of wars and insurrections
 don\u2019t panic. Yes
 these things must take place first
 but the end won\u2019t follow immediately.\u201d","Then he added
 \u201cNation will go to war against nation
 and kingdom against kingdom.","There will be great earthquakes
 and there will be famines and plagues in many lands
 and there will be terrifying things and great miraculous signs from heaven.","\u201cBut before all this occurs
 there will be a time of great persecution. You will be dragged into synagogues and prisons
 and you will stand trial before kings and governors because you are my followers.","But this will be your opportunity to tell them about me.","So don\u2019t worry in advance about how to answer the charges against you
","for I will give you the right words and such wisdom that none of your opponents will be able to reply or refute you!","Even those closest to you\u2014your parents
 brothers
 relatives
 and friends\u2014will betray you. They will even kill some of you.","And everyone will hate you because you are my followers.","But not a hair of your head will perish!","By standing firm
 you will win your souls.","\u201cAnd when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies
 then you will know that the time of its destruction has arrived.","Then those in Judea must flee to the hills. Those in Jerusalem must get out
 and those out in the country should not return to the city.","For those will be days of God\u2019s vengeance
 and the prophetic words of the Scriptures will be fulfilled.","How terrible it will be for pregnant women and for nursing mothers in those days. For there will be disaster in the land and great anger against this people.","They will be killed by the sword or sent away as captives to all the nations of the world. And Jerusalem will be trampled down by the Gentiles until the period of the Gentiles comes to an end.","\u201cAnd there will be strange signs in the sun
 moon
 and stars. And here on earth the nations will be in turmoil
 perplexed by the roaring seas and strange tides.","People will be terrified at what they see coming upon the earth
 for the powers in the heavens will be shaken.","Then everyone will see the Son of Man coming on a cloud with power and great glory.","So when all these things begin to happen
 stand and look up
 for your salvation is near!\u201d","Then he gave them this illustration: \u201cNotice the fig tree
 or any other tree.","When the leaves come out
 you know without being told that summer is near.","In the same way
 when you see all these things taking place
 you can know that the Kingdom of God is near.","I tell you the truth
 this generation will not pass from the scene until all these things have taken place.","Heaven and earth will disappear
 but my words will never disappear.","\u201cWatch out! Don\u2019t let your hearts be dulled by carousing and drunkenness
 and by the worries of this life. Don\u2019t let that day catch you unaware
","like a trap. For that day will come upon everyone living on the earth.","Keep alert at all times. And pray that you might be strong enough to escape these coming horrors and stand before the Son of Man.\u201d","Jesus sent Peter and John ahead and said
 \u201cGo and prepare the Passover meal
 so we can eat it together.\u201d","He replied
 \u201cAs soon as you enter Jerusalem
 a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you. Follow him. At the house he enters
","say to the owner
 \u2018The Teacher asks: Where is the guest room where I can eat the Passover meal with my disciples?\u2019","He will take you upstairs to a large room that is already set up. That is where you should prepare our meal.\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cI have been very eager to eat this Passover meal with you before my suffering begins.","For I tell you now that I won\u2019t eat this meal again until its meaning is fulfilled in the Kingdom of God.\u201d","Then he took a cup of wine and gave thanks to God for it. Then he said
 \u201cTake this and share it among yourselves.","For I will not drink wine again until the Kingdom of God has come.\u201d","He took some bread and gave thanks to God for it. Then he broke it in pieces and gave it to the disciples
 saying
 \u201cThis is my body
 which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me.\u201d","After supper he took another cup of wine and said
 \u201cThis cup is the new covenant between God and his people\u2014an agreement confirmed with my blood
 which is poured out as a sacrifice for you.","\u201cBut here at this table
 sitting among us as a friend
 is the man who will betray me.","For it has been determined that the Son of Man must die. But what sorrow awaits the one who betrays him.\u201d","Jesus told them
 \u201cIn this world the kings and great men lord it over their people
 yet they are called \u2018friends of the people.\u2019","But among you it will be different. Those who are the greatest among you should take the lowest rank
 and the leader should be like a servant.","Who is more important
 the one who sits at the table or the one who serves? The one who sits at the table
 of course. But not here! For I am among you as one who serves.","\u201cYou have stayed with me in my time of trial.","And just as my Father has granted me a Kingdom
 I now grant you the right","to eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom. And you will sit on thrones
 judging the twelve tribes of Israel.","\u201cSimon
 Simon
 Satan has asked to sift each of you like wheat.","But I have pleaded in prayer for you
 Simon
 that your faith should not fail. So when you have repented and turned to me again
 strengthen your brothers.\u201d","Peter said
 \u201cLord
 I am ready to go to prison with you
 and even to die with you.\u201d","But Jesus said
 \u201cPeter
 let me tell you something. Before the rooster crows tomorrow morning
 you will deny three times that you even know me.\u201d","Then Jesus asked them
 \u201cWhen I sent you out to preach the Good News and you did not have money
 a traveler\u2019s bag
 or an extra pair of sandals
 did you need anything?\u201d \u201cNo
\u201d they replied.","\u201cBut now
\u201d he said
 \u201ctake your money and a traveler\u2019s bag. And if you don\u2019t have a sword
 sell your cloak and buy one!","For the time has come for this prophecy about me to be fulfilled: \u2018He was counted among the rebels.\u2019 Yes
 everything written about me by the prophets will come true.\u201d","\u201cLook
 Lord
\u201d they replied
 \u201cwe have two swords among us.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s enough
\u201d he said.","There he told them
 \u201cPray that you will not give in to temptation.\u201d","\u201cFather
 if you are willing
 please take this cup of suffering away from me. Yet I want your will to be done
 not mine.\u201d","\u201cWhy are you sleeping?\u201d he asked them. \u201cGet up and pray
 so that you will not give in to temptation.\u201d","But Jesus said
 \u201cJudas
 would you betray the Son of Man with a kiss?\u201d","But Jesus said
 \u201cNo more of this.\u201d And he touched the man\u2019s ear and healed him.","Then Jesus spoke to the leading priests
 the captains of the Temple guard
 and the elders who had come for him. \u201cAm I some dangerous revolutionary
\u201d he asked
 \u201cthat you come with swords and clubs to arrest me?","Why didn\u2019t you arrest me in the Temple? I was there every day. But this is your moment
 the time when the power of darkness reigns.\u201d","At that moment the Lord turned and looked at Peter. Suddenly
 the Lord\u2019s words flashed through Peter\u2019s mind: \u201cBefore the rooster crows tomorrow morning
 you will deny three times that you even know me.\u201d","and they said
 \u201cTell us
 are you the Messiah?\u201d But he replied
 \u201cIf I tell you
 you won\u2019t believe me.","And if I ask you a question
 you won\u2019t answer.","But from now on the Son of Man will be seated in the place of power at God\u2019s right hand.\u201d","They all shouted
 \u201cSo
 are you claiming to be the Son of God?\u201d And he replied
 \u201cYou say that I am.\u201d","So Pilate asked him
 \u201cAre you the king of the Jews?\u201d Jesus replied
 \u201cYou have said it.\u201d","\u201cOh
 is he a Galilean?\u201d Pilate asked.","and he announced his verdict. \u201cYou brought this man to me
 accusing him of leading a revolt. I have examined him thoroughly on this point in your presence and find him innocent.","For the third time he demanded
 \u201cWhy? What crime has he committed? I have found no reason to sentence him to death. So I will have him flogged
 and then I will release him.\u201d","But Jesus turned and said to them
 \u201cDaughters of Jerusalem
 don\u2019t weep for me
 but weep for yourselves and for your children.","For the days are coming when they will say
 \u2018Fortunate indeed are the women who are childless
 the wombs that have not borne a child and the breasts that have never nursed.\u2019","People will beg the mountains
 \u2018Fall on us
\u2019 and plead with the hills
 \u2018Bury us.\u2019","For if these things are done when the tree is green
 what will happen when it is dry?\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cFather
 forgive them
 for they don\u2019t know what they are doing.\u201d And the soldiers gambled for his clothes by throwing dice.","And Jesus replied
 \u201cI assure you
 today you will be with me in paradise.\u201d","Then Jesus shouted
 \u201cFather
 I entrust my spirit into your hands!\u201d And with those words he breathed his last.","The women were terrified and bowed with their faces to the ground. Then the men asked
 \u201cWhy are you looking among the dead for someone who is alive?","He asked them
 \u201cWhat are you discussing so intently as you walk along?\u201d They stopped short
 sadness written across their faces.","\u201cWhat things?\u201d Jesus asked. \u201cThe things that happened to Jesus
 the man from Nazareth
\u201d they said. \u201cHe was a prophet who did powerful miracles
 and he was a mighty teacher in the eyes of God and all the people.","Then Jesus said to them
 \u201cYou foolish people! You find it so hard to believe all that the prophets wrote in the Scriptures.","Wasn\u2019t it clearly predicted that the Messiah would have to suffer all these things before entering his glory?\u201d","And just as they were telling about it
 Jesus himself was suddenly standing there among them. \u201cPeace be with you

 as you see that I do.\u201d","Still they stood there in disbelief
 filled with joy and wonder. Then he asked them
 \u201cDo you have anything here to eat?\u201d","Then he said
 \u201cWhen I was with you before
 I told you that everything written about me in the law of Moses and the prophets and in the Psalms must be fulfilled.\u201d","And he said
 \u201cYes
 it was written long ago that the Messiah would suffer and die and rise from the dead on the third day.","It was also written that this message would be proclaimed in the authority of his name to all the nations

 just as my Father promised. But stay here in the city until the Holy Spirit comes and fills you with power from heaven.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cWhy were you looking for Me? Do you not know that I must be in My Father\u2019s house?\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cIt is written
 \u2018Man is not to live by bread alone.\u2019\u201d (B) ","The devil said to Jesus

 \u2018You must worship the Lord your God. You must obey Him only.\u2019\u201d (C) ","Then the devil took Jesus up to Jerusalem. He had Jesus stand on the highest part of the house of God. The devil said to Jesus

 do in Your own country!\u2019\u201d ","He said
 \u201cA man who speaks for God is not respected in his own country. ","It is true that there were many women whose husbands had died in the Jewish land when Elijah lived. For three and a half years there was no rain and there was very little food in the land.","Elijah was sent to none of them
 but he was sent to a woman in the city of Zarephath in the land of Sidon. This woman\u2019s husband had died. ","There were many people in the Jewish land who had a bad skin disease when the early preacher Elisha lived. None of them was healed. But Naaman from the country of Syria was healed.\u201d","The people were surprised and wondered about His teaching. His words had power.","Jesus spoke sharp words to the demon and said
 \u201cDo not talk! Come out of him!\u201d When the demon had thrown the man down
 he came out without hurting the man.","Also demons came out of many people. The demons cried out and said
 \u201cYou are Christ
 the Son of God.\u201d Jesus spoke strong words to them and would not let them speak. They knew He was the Christ.","He said to them
 \u201cI must preach about the holy nation of God in other cities also. This is why I was sent.\u201d ","When He had finished speaking
 He said to Simon
 \u201cPush out into the deep water. Let down your nets for some fish.\u201d ","James and John
 the sons of Zebedee
 were surprised also. They were working together with Simon. Then Jesus said to Simon
 \u201cDo not be afraid. From now on you will fish for men.\u201d ","Jesus put His hand on him and said
 \u201cI will
 be healed.\u201d At once the disease went away from him. ","Then Jesus told him to tell no one. He said
 \u201cGo and let the religious leader of the Jews see you. Give the gift on the altar in worship that Moses told you to give when a man is healed of a disease. This will show the leaders you have been healed.\u201d ","When Jesus saw their faith
 He said to the man
 \u201cFriend
 your sins are forgiven.\u201d ","Jesus knew what they were thinking. He said to them
 \u201cWhy do you think this way in your hearts? ","Which is easier to say
 \u2018Your sins are forgiven
\u2019 or
 \u2018Get up and walk\u2019? ","\u201cSo that you may know the Son of Man has the right and the power on earth to forgive sins

 \u201cFollow Me.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cPeople who are well do not need a doctor. Only those who are sick need a doctor. ","I have not come to call good people. I have come to call sinners to be sorry for their sins and to turn from them.\u201d","They asked Jesus
 \u201cWhy do the followers of John and of the proud religious law-keepers go without food so they can pray better
 but Your followers keep on eating and drinking?\u201d ","Jesus answered them
 \u201cCan the friends at a wedding be sorry when the man just married is with them? ","The days will come when the man just married will be taken from them. Then they will not eat food so they can pray better in those days.\u201d","Then Jesus told them a picture-story. He said
 \u201cNo one sews a piece of cloth from a new coat on an old coat. If he does
 the new coat will have a hole. The new piece and the old coat will not be the same. ","No man puts new wine into old skin bags. If they did
 the skins would break and the wine would run out. The bags would be no good. ","New wine must be put into new bags and both are kept safe.","No one wants new wine after drinking old wine. He says
 \u2018The old wine is better.\u2019\u201d","Jesus answered them
 \u201cHave you not read what David did when he and his men were hungry? ","He went into the house of God and ate the special bread used in the religious worship. He gave some to those who were with him also. The Law says only the religious leaders may eat that bread.","The Son of Man is Lord of the Day of Rest also.\u201d","Jesus knew what they were thinking. He said to the man with the dried-up hand
 \u201cStand up and come here.\u201d The man stood up and went to Jesus. ","Then Jesus said to them
 \u201cI will ask you one thing. Does the Law say to do good on the Day of Rest or to do bad? To save life or to kill?\u201d ","Jesus looked around at them all and said to the man

 \u201cCan one blind man lead another blind man? Will they not fall into the ditch together? ","The follower is not more important than his teacher. But everyone who learns well will be like his teacher.","\u201cWhy do you look at the small piece of wood in your brother\u2019s eye and do not see the big piece of wood in your own eye?","How can you say to your brother

 \u2018He has a demon.\u2019 ","The Son of Man came eating and drinking and you say

 some fell by the side of the road. It was walked on and birds came and ate it. ","Some seed fell between rocks. As soon as it started to grow
 it dried up because it had no water. ","Some seed fell among thorns. The thorns grew and did not give the seed room to grow.","Some seed fell on good ground. It grew and gave one hundred times as much grain.\u201d When Jesus had finished saying this

And the fun of this life lets the thorns grow. Their grain never becomes full-grown.","But those which fell on good ground have heard the Word. They keep it in a good and true heart and they keep on giving good grain.","\u201cNo man lights a lamp and puts it under a pail or under a bed.

 he had loving-pity on him. ","He got down and put oil and wine on the places where he was hurt and put cloth around them. Then the man from Samaria put this man on his own donkey.

 \u2018See! For three years I have been coming here looking for fruit on this fig tree. I never find any. Cut it down. Why does it even waste the ground?\u2019 ","The servant said
 \u2018Sir! Leave it here one more year. I will dig around it and put plant food on it. ","It may be that it will give fruit next year. If it does not
 then cut it down.\u2019\u201d","Jesus saw her and said
 \u201cWoman
 you are now free from your trouble!\u201d ","The Lord said to him
 \u201cYou pretend to be someone you are not! Do not each of you let his cow or his donkey out and lead them to water on the Day of Rest? ","Should not this Jewish woman be made free from this trouble on the Day of Rest? She has been chained by Satan for eighteen years.\u201d","Then Jesus asked
 \u201cWhat is the holy nation of God like? What can I use to show you? ","It is like a mustard seed which a man took and planted in his field. It grew and became a tree. The birds of the sky stayed in its branches.\u201d","Again Jesus said
 \u201cWhat can I use to show you what the holy nation of God is like? ","It is like yeast that a woman put into three pails of flour until it was all full of yeast.\u201d","Someone asked Jesus

 you killed the fat calf. And yet he wasted your money with bad women.\u2019 ","\u201cThe father said to him

 \u2018What will I do now? The owner of the houses and lands is taking my work away from me. I cannot dig in the ground for a living. I am too proud to ask for help. ","I know what I will do. I will make it so that when I lose this work I will be able to go to the homes of my friends.\u2019","\u201cHe sent for the people who owed the rich man. He asked the first one

 make friends for yourselves by using the riches of the world that are so often used in wrong ways. So when riches are a thing of the past
 friends may receive you into a home that will be forever. ","He that is faithful with little things is faithful with big things also. He that is not honest with little things is not honest with big things.","If you have not been faithful with riches of this world

 \u201cYou are the kind of people who make yourselves look good before other people. God knows your hearts. What men think is good is hated in the eyes of God. ","Until John came
 you had the writings of the Law and of the early preachers. From that time until now the Good News of the holy nation of God has been preached. Everyone is pushing his way in. ","But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one small part of a word in the Law to be of no more use.","\u201cWhoever divorces his wife and marries another woman is not faithful in marriage and is guilty of sex sins.","\u201cThere was a rich man who dressed in purple linen clothes everyday.

 take pity on me. Send Lazarus. Let him put the end of his finger in water and cool my tongue. I am in much pain in this fire.\u2019 ","Abraham said
 \u2018My son
 do not forget that when you were living you had your good things. Lazarus had bad things. Now he is well cared for. You are in pain. ","And more than all this
 there is a big deep place between us. No one from here can go there even if he wanted to go. No one can come from there.\u2019 ","\u201cThen the rich man said

 \u2018They have the Writings of Moses and of the early preachers. Let them hear what they say.\u2019 ","But the rich man said
 \u2018No

 they will not listen even if someone is raised from the dead.\u2019\u201d","Jesus said to His followers

 things will come that will make people sin. But it is bad for the person who makes someone else sin. ","It would be better for him to have a large rock put around his neck and be thrown into the sea
 than that he should cause one of these little ones to sin. ","\u201cWatch yourselves! If your brother sins
 speak sharp words to him. If he is sorry and turns from his sin
 forgive him. ","What if he sins against you seven times in one day? If he comes to you and says he is sorry and turns from his sin
 forgive him.\u201d ","The Lord said

 \u2018Get my supper ready. Dress yourself and care for me until I am through eating and drinking. Then you can eat and drink.\u2019 ","Does the servant get thanks for doing what he was told to do? I am sure he does not.","It is the same with you also. When you do everything you have been told to do
 you must say
 \u2018We are not any special servants. We have done only what we should have done.\u2019\u201d","Jesus went on His way to Jerusalem. He was passing between the countries of Samaria and Galilee.","When Jesus saw them

 here it is!\u2019 or
 \u2018There it is!\u2019 For the holy nation of God is in you.\u201d","Jesus said to His followers
 \u201cThe time will come when you will wish you could see the Son of Man for one day. But you will not be able to. ","They will say to you
 \u2018He is here
\u2019 or
 \u2018He is there
\u2019 but do not follow them. ","When the Son of Man comes
 He will be as lightning that shines from one part of the sky to the other. ","But before that
 He must suffer many hard things. The people of this day will have nothing to do with Him. ","\u201cAs it was in the time of Noah
 so will it be when the Son of Man comes back. ","People ate and drank. They married and were given in marriage. They did these things until the day Noah went into the large boat.

 fire and sulphur came down from heaven like rain. It killed all the people of Sodom. ","\u201cIt will be the same on the day when the Son of Man comes again.","In that day the man who is on top of a house should not come down to take his things out of the house. In the same way
 the man who is in the field should not go back to his house. ","Remember Lot\u2019s wife!","\u201cHe who wants to keep his life will have it taken away from him. He who loses his life will have it given back to him.","I tell you
 on that night there will be two men in the same bed. One of them will be taken. The other will be left. ","Two women will be grinding grain together. One of them will be taken. The other will be left.","Then they asked Jesus
 \u201cWhere will this happen?\u201d He said to them
 \u201cBirds also gather where there is a dead body.\u201d","He said
 \u201cThere was a man in one of the cities who was head of the court. His work was to say if a person was guilty or not. This man was not afraid of God. He did not respect any man. ","In that city there was a woman whose husband had died. She kept coming to him and saying
 \u2018Help me! There is someone who is working against me.\u2019 ","For awhile he would not help her. Then he began to think
 \u2018I am not afraid of God and I do not respect any man. ","But I will see that this woman whose husband has died gets her rights because I get tired of her coming all the time.\u2019\u201d","Then the Lord said
 \u201cListen to the words of the sinful man who is head of the court. ","Will not God make the things that are right come to His chosen people who cry day and night to Him? Will He wait a long time to help them?","I tell you
 He will be quick to help them. But when the Son of Man comes
 will He find faith on the earth?\u201d","Jesus said
 \u201cTwo men went up to the house of God to pray. One of them was a proud religious law-keeper. The other was a man who gathered taxes. ","The proud religious law-keeper stood and prayed to himself like this
 \u2018God
 I thank You that I am not like other men. I am not like those who steal. I am not like those who do things that are wrong. I am not like those who do sex sins. I am not even like this tax-gatherer. ","I go without food two times a week so I can pray better. I give one-tenth part of the money I earn.\u2019","But the man who gathered taxes stood a long way off.

 have pity on me! I am a sinner!\u2019 ","I tell you
 this man went back to his house forgiven

 \u201cLet the little children come to Me. Do not try to stop them. The holy nation of God is made up of ones like these. ","For sure
 I tell you
 whoever does not receive the holy nation of God as a child will not go into the holy nation.\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cWhy do you call Me good? There is only One Who is good. That is God. ","You know the Laws. You must not do any sex sins. You must not kill another person. You must not steal. You must not tell a lie about someone else. Respect your father and your mother.\u201d","The leader said
 \u201cI have obeyed all these Laws since I was a boy.\u201d","When Jesus heard this

 He said
 \u201cIt is hard for those with riches to go into the holy nation of God! ","It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to go into the holy nation of God.\u201d","Jesus said

","At the time of gathering fruit he sent one of his servants to the farmers to get some of the fruit. But the farmers beat him and sent him away without fruit.","He sent another servant. The farmers beat him also. They made it very hard for him and sent him away without fruit.","He sent a third servant. They hurt him and threw him out of the grape-field.","\u201cThen the owner of the grape-field said
 \u2018What should I do? I will send my much-loved son. They might respect him.\u2019 ","The farmers saw the son. They said to themselves
 \u2018This is the one who will get everything when the owner dies. Let us kill him
 and we will get everything.\u2019 ","They put him out of the grape-field and killed him. Now what will the owner of the grape-field do to them?","He will come and kill those farmers. Then he will rent the grape-field to other farmers.\u201d","Jesus looked at them and said
 \u201cWhat does this writing mean
 \u2018The Stone that was put aside by the workmen has become the most important Stone in the building\u2019? (C) ","Whoever falls on this Stone will be broken. And on the one it falls
 it will make him like dust.\u201d (D)","They watched Jesus and they sent men who pretended to be good people to watch Him. They wanted to trap Him in something He said. Then they could give Him over to the leader of the people who had the right and the power to say what to do with Him.","\u201cShow Me a piece of money. Whose picture is this? Whose name is on it?\u201d And they said
 \u201cCaesar\u2019s.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cPay to Caesar the things that belong to Caesar. Pay to God the things that belong to God.\u201d ","They could find nothing wrong with what He taught. They were surprised and wondered about what He told the people
 so they said nothing more.","Jesus said to them
 \u201cPeople of this earth marry and are given in marriage. ","But those who have the right to have that life and are raised from the dead do not marry and are not given in marriage.","They cannot die anymore. They are as the angels and are sons of God. They are children who have been raised from the dead.","As for the dead being raised
 even Moses spoke of that when he told of the burning bush. There he calls the Lord
 the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob. ","For He is not the God of the dead. He is the God of the living. All live for Him.\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cHow do they say that Christ is the Son of David? ","For David himself said in the Book of Psalms
 \u2018The Lord said to My Lord
 \u201cSit at my right side ","until I make those who hate You a place to rest Your feet.\u201d\u2019 (I)","David calls Him
 \u2018Lord!\u2019 Then how can He be his son?\u201d","\u201cLook out for the teachers of the Law. They like to walk around in long coats. They like to have people speak words of respect to them in the center of town where people gather. They like the important seats in the places of worship. They like the important places at big suppers.","They take houses from poor women whose husbands have died. They cover up their actions by making long prayers. They will be punished all the more.\u201d","He said
 \u201cI tell you the truth
 this poor woman has put in more than all of them. ","For they have put in a little of the money they had no need for. She is very poor and has put in all she had. She has put in what she needed for her own living.\u201d","\u201cAs for these things you see
 all these stones will be thrown down. Not one will be left on another.\u201d ","He said
 \u201cBe careful that no one leads you the wrong way. For many people will come in My name. They will say
 \u2018I am the Christ.\u2019 The time is near. Do not follow them. ","When you hear of wars and fighting in different places
 do not be afraid. These things have to happen first
 but the end is not yet.\u201d ","Then Jesus said to them
 \u201cNations will have wars with other nations. Countries will fight against countries. ","The earth will shake and break apart in different places. There will be no food. There will be bad diseases among many people. Very special things will be seen in the sky that will make people much afraid.","\u201cBut before all this happens
 men will take hold of you and make it very hard for you. They will give you over to the places of worship and to the prisons. They will bring you in front of kings and the leaders of the people. This will all be done to you because of Me. ","This will be a time for you to tell about Me.","Do not think about what you will say ahead of time.","For I will give you wisdom in what to say and I will help you say it. Those who are against you will not be able to stop you or say you are wrong.","\u201cYou will be handed over by your parents and your brothers and your family and your friends. They will kill some of you.","All men will hate you because of Me.","Yet not one hair of your head will be lost.","But stay true and your souls will have life.","\u201cWhen you see armies all around Jerusalem
 know that it will soon be destroyed. ","Those in the country of Judea must run to the mountains. Those in the city must leave at once. Those in the country must not go into the city.","People will be punished in these hard days. All things will happen as it is written.","\u201cIt will be hard for women who will soon be mothers. It will be hard for those feeding babies in those days. It will be very hard for the people in the land and anger will be brought down on them.","People will be killed by the sword. They will be held in prison by all nations. Jerusalem will be walked over by the people who are not Jews until their time is finished.","\u201cThere will be special things to look for in the sun and moon and stars. The nations of the earth will be troubled and will not know what to do. They will be troubled at the angry sea and waves.","The hearts of men will give up because of being afraid of what is coming on the earth. The powers of the heavens will be shaken.","Then they will see the Son of Man coming in the clouds with power and much greatness.","When these things begin to happen
 lift up your heads because you have been bought by the blood of Christ and will soon be free.\u201d","Jesus told them a picture-story. He said
 \u201cLook at the fig tree and all the other trees. ","When you see their leaves coming out
 you know summer is near. ","In the same way
 when you see these things happening
 you will know the holy nation of God is near. ","For sure
 I tell you
 that the people of this day will not die before all these things happen.","\u201cHeaven and earth will pass away
 but My Words will not pass away. ","Watch yourselves! Do not let yourselves be loaded down with too much eating and strong drink. Do not be troubled with the cares of this life. If you do
 that day will come on you without you knowing it. ","It will come on all people over all the earth.","Be sure you watch. Pray all the time so that you may be able to keep from going through all these things that will happen and be able to stand before the Son of Man.\u201d","Jesus sent Peter and John and said
 \u201cGo and get this special supper ready for us that we may eat.\u201d ","He answered
 \u201cSee
 when you go into the city
 you will meet a man carrying a jar of water. Follow him into the house where he goes. ","Say to the owner of the house
 \u2018The Teacher asks you
 \u201cWhere is the room you keep for friends where I may eat this special supper with My followers?\u201d\u2019 ","He will take you to a large room on the second floor with everything in it. Make it ready for us.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cI have wanted very much to eat this special supper with you to remember how the Jews left Egypt. I have wanted to eat this with you before I suffer. ","I say to you
 I will not eat this special supper again until its true meaning is completed in the holy nation of God.\u201d ","Then Jesus took the cup and gave thanks. He said
 \u201cTake this and pass it to each one. ","I say to you that I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the holy nation of God comes.\u201d","Then Jesus took bread and gave thanks and broke it in pieces. He gave it to them

 \u201cThis is My body which is given for you. Do this to remember Me.\u201d ","In the same way
 after they had finished the bread
 He took the cup. He said
 \u201cThis cup is My blood of the New Way of Worship which is given for you.","\u201cSee
 the hand of the one who will give Me over to the leaders of the country is on the table with Me. ","The Son of Man will be taken this way because it has been in God\u2019s plan. But it is bad for that man who hands Him over!\u201d","Jesus said to them
 \u201cThe kings of the nations show their power to the people. Those who have power over the people are given names of honor. ","But you will not be like that. Let the greatest among you be as the least. Let the leader be as the one who cares for others.","Who is greater
 the one who is eating at the table
 or the one who is caring for him? Is it not the one who is eating at the table? But I am here with you as One Who cares for you.","\u201cYou have stayed with Me through all the hard things that have come to Me.","As My Father has given Me a holy nation
 I will give you the right ","to eat and drink at My table in My holy nation. You will sit on thrones and judge the twelve family groups of the Jewish nation.\u201d","The Lord said
 \u201cSimon
 Simon
 listen! Satan has wanted to have you. He will divide you as wheat is divided from that which is no good. ","But I have prayed for you. I have prayed that your faith will be strong and that you will not give up. When you return
 you must help to make your brothers strong.\u201d ","Peter said to Jesus

 Peter

 \u201cI sent you without money or bag or shoes. Did you need anything?\u201d They said
 \u201cNothing.\u201d ","Then He said to them
 \u201cBut now whoever has a money-bag and a bag for food should take it. Whoever does not have a sword should sell his coat and buy one. ","I tell you
 that what has been written about Me must happen. It says
 \u2018They thought of Him as One Who broke the Law.\u2019 (E) What is told about Me must happen.\u201d","They said
 \u201cLord
 look
 we have two swords.\u201d He answered
 \u201cThat is enough.\u201d","When He got there
 He said to them
 \u201cPray that you will not be tempted.\u201d ","He said
 \u201cFather

 \u201cJudas
 are you handing over the Son of Man with a kiss?\u201d ","Jesus said
 \u201cStop! This is enough.\u201d And He put His hand on his ear and healed him.","Jesus said to the religious leaders and the leaders of the house of God and the other leaders who came to Him

 as if I were a robber? ","While I was with you everyday in the house of God

 \u201cBefore a rooster crows
 you will say three times that you do not know Me.\u201d ","\u201cTell us if you are the Christ.\u201d He said to them
 \u201cIf I tell you
 you will not believe Me. ","If I ask you something
 you will not tell Me. ","From now on
 the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the All-powerful God.\u201d ","They all said
 \u201cThen are You the Son of God?\u201d He said
 \u201cYou say that I am.\u201d ","Pilate asked Jesus
 \u201cAre You the King of the Jews?\u201d He said
 \u201cWhat you said is true.\u201d ","When Pilate heard the word
 Galilee
 he asked
 \u201cIs the Man from Galilee?\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cYou brought this Man to me as one that leads the people in the wrong way. I have asked Him about these things in front of you. I do not find Him guilty of the things you say against Him. ","Pilate said to them the third time
 \u201cWhy
 what bad thing has He done? I have found no reason to put Him to death. I will punish Him and let Him go free.\u201d","Jesus turned to them and said
 \u201cDaughters of Jerusalem do not cry for Me. Cry for yourselves and your children. ","Listen! The days are coming when they will say
 \u2018Those who have never had children are happy. Those whose bodies have never given birth are happy. Those who have never fed babies are happy.\u2019 ","They will begin to say to the mountains
 \u2018Fall on us.\u2019 They will say to the hills
 \u2018Cover us.\u2019 ","If they do these things to a green tree
 what will they do when it is dry?\u201d","Then Jesus said
 \u201cFather
 forgive them. They do not know what they are doing.\u201d And they divided His clothes by drawing names.","Jesus said to him
 \u201cFor sure
 I tell you
 today you will be with Me in Paradise.\u201d","Then Jesus cried out with a loud voice
 \u201cFather
 into Your hands I give My spirit.\u201d When He said this
 He died.","They were very much afraid and got down with their faces to the ground. The men said to them
 \u201cWhy do you look for the living One among those who are dead? ","He said to them
 \u201cWhat are you talking about as you walk?\u201d They stood still and looked sad. ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cWhat things?\u201d They answered
 \u201cThe things about Jesus of Nazareth. He was the great One Who spoke for God. He did powerful works and spoke powerful words in the sight of God and the people. ","Then Jesus said to them
 \u201cYou foolish men. How slow you are to believe what the early preachers have said. ","Did not Christ have to go through these hard things to come into His shining-greatness?\u201d","As they talked
 Jesus Himself stood among them. He said
 \u201cMay you have peace.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cWhy are you afraid? Why do you have doubts in your hearts? ","Look at My hands and My feet. See! It is I
 Myself! Touch Me and see for yourself. A spirit does not have flesh and bones as I have.\u201d ","They still wondered. It was hard for them to believe it and yet it made them happy. Then He said to them
 \u201cDo you have anything here to eat?\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cThese are the things I told you while I was yet with you. All things written about Me in the Law of Moses and in the Books of the early preachers and in the Psalms must happen as they said they would happen.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cIt is written that Christ should suffer and be raised from the dead after three days. ","It must be preached that men must be sorry for their sins and turn from them. Then they will be forgiven. This must be preached in His name to all nations beginning in Jerusalem.","You are to tell what you have seen.","See! I will send you what My Father promised. But you are to stay in Jerusalem until you have received power from above.\u201d","And he said to them
 How is it that you were searching for me? Did you not know that I must go about my Father\u2019s business?","And Jesus answered him
 saying
 It is written: Man shall not live by bread alone
 but by every word of God.","And the devil said to him
 All this power I will give you
 every whit
 and the glory of these kingdoms. For it has been delivered to me
 and to whomever I wish
 I give it. ","Jesus answered him and said
 Away from me
 Satan! For it is written: You shall honour the Lord your God
 and him only serve.","And the devil carried him to Jerusalem
 and set him on a pinnacle of the temple and said to him
 If you are the Son of God
 cast yourself down from here. ","Jesus answered and said to him
 It is said: You shall not tempt the Lord your God.","The Spirit of the Lord is upon me
 because he has anointed me. To preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me
 and to heal the broken-hearted; to preach deliverance to the captive
 and sight to the blind
 and freely to set at liberty those who are bruised
 ","and to preach the favoured year of the Lord.","And he began and said to them
 This day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears.","And he said to them
 You may very well say to me this maxim: Physician
 heal thyself; the things that we heard were done in Capernaum
 do the same here likewise in your own country.","And he said
 Truly I say to you
 no prophet is accepted in his own country. ","But I tell you of a truth
 many widows were in Israel in the days of Elijah
 when heaven was shut for three years and six months
 when great famine was throughout all the land; ","but to none of them was Elijah sent save into Sarepta
 a city of Sidon
 to a woman who was a widow. ","And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet
 and yet none of them was healed except Naaman of Syria.","And they were astonished at his instruction
 for his preaching was with power.","And Jesus rebuked him
 saying
 Hold your peace and come out of him! And the devil threw the man in the midst of them and came out of him
 and did not hurt him.","And devils also came out of many of them
 crying out and saying
 You are Christ
 the Son of God!","But he said to them
 I must preach the kingdom of God to other places also
 for that is why I have been sent.","When he had left speaking
 he said to Simon
 Launch out into the deep
 and let slip your nets to make a catch. ","and so also were James and John
 the sons of Zebedee
 who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon
 Fear not; from henceforth you shall catch men.","And Jesus stretched forth his hand and touched him
 saying
 I will; be clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him. ","And Jesus told him not to tell anyone
 but to go and show himself to the priest
 and to make an offering for his cleansing
 as Moses had commanded
 for a witness to them. ","When he saw their faith
 he said to him
 Man
 your sins are forgiven you. ","When Jesus perceived their thoughts
 he answered and said to them
 What are you thinking in your hearts? ","Which is easier to say: Your sins are forgiven you
 or to say
 Rise and walk?\u00a0 ","But so that you may know that the Son of man has power to forgive sins on earth \u2013 He said to the paralytic
 I say to you
 arise; take up your bed and go home to your house.","And after that
 Jesus went out and saw a publican named Levi sitting at the receipt of custom
 and said to him
 Follow me. ","Jesus answered and said to them
 The whole have no need for the physician
 but the sick do. ","I came not to call the righteous
 but sinners
 to repentance.","Then they said to him
 Why do the disciples of John fast often
 and pray
 and the disciples of the Pharisees also
 but yours eat and drink?","And he said to them
 Can you make the children of the wedding fast while the bridegroom is present with them? ","The days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them. Then they will fast
 in those days.","Then he spoke to them in a similitude: No one patches a piece of a new garment into an old vesture
 because if he does
 then he will have cut up the new
 and the piece that was taken out of the new does not agree with the old. ","Also
 no one pours new wine into old wineskins
 because if he does
 the new wine bursts the vessels and runs out
 and the vessels are destroyed. ","But new wine must be poured into new vessels
 and both are preserved. ","Also
 no one who drinks old wine can straightaway abide the new
 for he says the old is pleasanter.","And Jesus answered them and said
 Have you not read what David did when he himself was hungry
 and those who were with him? ","How he went into the house of God
 and took and ate the loaves of hallowed bread
 and gave also to those who were with him \u2013 which bread it was not lawful to eat
 but for the priests only? ","And he said to them
 The Son of man is Lord of the Sabbath day.","But he knew their thoughts
 and said to the man that had the withered hand
 Rise up
 and stand forth in the midst. And he arose and stepped forth. ","Then Jesus said to them
 I will ask you a question: whether it is lawful on the Sabbath days to do good
 or to do evil; to save life
 or to destroy it? ","And he looked around at them all and said to the man
 Stretch forth your hand. And he did so
 and his hand was restored and made as whole as the other.","Blessed are you who hunger now
 for you shall be satisfied. Blessed are you who weep now
 for you will laugh. ","Blessed are you when men hate you and thrust you out of their company
 and rail
 and abhor your name as an evil thing
 for the Son of man\u2019s sake. ","Rejoice then
 and be glad
 for behold
 your reward is great in heaven. Likewise did their fathers treat the prophets.","But woe is to you who are rich
 for you have therein your consolation. ","Woe to you who are full
 for you shall hunger. Woe to you who now laugh
 for you will wail and weep. ","Woe to you when all men praise you
 for likewise did their fathers praise the false prophets.","But I say to you who hear: Love your enemies. Do good to those who hate you.","Bless those who curse you
 and pray for those who wrongfully trouble you. ","And to him that strikes you on the one cheek
 offer also the other. And him that takes away your gown
 forbid not to take your coat also. ","Give to every man that asks of you. And of him who takes away your goods
 ask not for them back. ","And as you would have others do unto you
 so do unto them likewise.","If you love those who love you
 what credit are you worthy of? For the very sinners love their friends. ","And if you do good to those who do good to you
 what credit are you worthy of? For the very sinners do even the same. ","If you lend to people from whom you hope to receive
 what credit should you have? For the very sinners lend to sinners
 to receive as much in return. ","Therefore love your enemies
 do good
 and lend
 looking for nothing in return; and your reward will be great
 and you will be the children of the Highest. For he is kind to the unkind and to the evil.","Be therefore merciful
 as your Father is merciful. ","Judge not
 and you will not be judged. Condemn not
 and you will not be condemned. Forgive
 and you will be forgiven. ","Give
 and it will be given to you: a good measure pressed down
 shaken together
 and running over will men give into your bosoms. For the measure that you use will be measured back to you.","And he put forth a similitude to them: Can the blind lead the blind? Do they not both then fall into the ditch?","The disciple is not above his master
 but everyone will be formed even as his teacher is.","Why do you see a speck in your brother\u2019s eye
 and not consider the beam that is in your own eye? ","Or how can you say to your brother
 Brother
 let me pull out the speck that is in your eye \u2013 when you do not perceive the beam that is in your own eye? Hypocrite! First cast the beam out of your own eye
 and then you will see clearly to pull the speck out of your brother\u2019s eye.","It is not a good tree that brings forth bad fruit
 nor is that a bad tree that brings forth good fruit. ","For every tree is known by its fruit. Neither is it from thorns that men gather figs
 nor from bushes that they gather grapes. ","A good man
 out of the good treasure of his heart
 brings forth that which is good. And an evil man
 out of the evil treasure of his heart
 brings forth that which is evil. For out of the abundance of the heart
 his mouth speaks.","Why do you call me Master
 Master
 and yet not do as I bid you? ","Whoever comes to me and hears my sayings and does them
 I will show you whom he is like: ","he is like a man who built a house
 and dug deep
 and laid the foundation on a rock. When the waters rose
 the flood beat upon that house
 and could not move it. For it was grounded upon a rock. ","But the person who hears and does not is like a man who built a house without a foundation upon the soil
 against which the flood beat
 and it fell immediately. And the fall of that house was great.","When Jesus heard this
 he marvelled at him
 and turned about and said to the people that followed him
 I say to you
 I have not found such great faith
 no
 not in Israel.","And when the Lord saw her
 he had compassion on her and said to her
 Weep not. ","And he went and touched the bier
 and those who were bearing it stood still. And he said
 Young man
 I say to you
 arise. ","And Jesus answered and said to John\u2019s disciples
 Go your ways and tell John what things you have seen and heard \u2013 how the blind see
 the lame walk
 the lepers are cleansed
 the deaf hear
 the dead arise. To the poor
 the glad tidings are preached; ","and happy is he who is not offended by me.","When the messengers of John had departed
 Jesus began to speak to the people about John. What did you go out into the wilderness to see? Did you go to see a reed shaken with the wind? ","But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold
 those who are gorgeously apparelled and live delicately are in kings\u2019 courts. ","But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yea
 I say to you
 and more than a prophet. ","This is he of whom it is written: Behold
 I send my messenger before your face
 to prepare your way before you. ","For I say to you
 among the children of women there is no greater prophet than John. Nevertheless
 one who is less in the kingdom of God
 is greater than he.","And the Lord said
 To what shall I liken the people of this generation
 and what are they like? ","They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling one to another
 and saying
 We have piped to you
 and you have not danced; we have mourned to you
 and you have not wept. ","For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine
 and you say he has the devil. ","The Son of man has come
 and eats and drinks
 and you say
 Here is a man who is a glutton and a drinker of wine
 a friend of publicans and sinners. ","Yet wisdom is justified by her children.","When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this
 he spoke within himself
 saying
 If this man were a prophet
 he would surely know who and what manner of woman this is that touches him; for she is a sinner. ","And Jesus responded and said to him
 Simon
 I have something to say to you. And he said
 Teacher
 say on.","There was a certain lender who had two debtors. One owed five hundred denarii
 and the other fifty. ","When they had nothing to pay
 he forgave them both. Which of them
 tell me
 will love him most?","Simon answered and said
 I suppose the one that was forgiven most.","And Jesus turned to the woman and said to Simon
 Do you see this woman? I entered into your house and you gave me no water for my feet
 but she has washed my feet with tears and wiped them with the hair of her head. ","You gave me no kiss
 but she
 since the time I came in
 has not ceased to kiss my feet. ","My head with oil you did not anoint
 but she has anointed my feet with oyntment. ","Therefore I say to you
 many sins are forgiven her
 for she loved much. But he who is forgiven less
 loves less.","And he said to her
 Your sins are forgiven you.","And he said to the woman
 Your faith has saved you. Go in peace.","When crowds of people were gathered together
 having come to him out of all places
 he spoke by a similitude: ","A sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed
 some fell by the wayside
 and it was trodden under foot
 and the fowls of the air devoured it up. ","And some fell on stone
 and as soon as it had sprung up
 it withered away
 because it lacked moisture. ","And some fell among thorns
 and the thorns grew up with it and choked it. ","And some fell on good ground
 and sprang up
 and bore fruit a hundredfold.","And he said
 To you it is given to know the secrets of the kingdom of God. But to others they remain in similitudes
 so that when they see
 they will not see
 and when they hear
 they will not understand.","The similitude is this: The seed is the word of God.","Those who are beside the way are the people that hear
 but afterward the devil comes and takes away the word out of their hearts
 lest they should believe and be saved. ","Those on the stones are people who
 when they hear
 receive the word with joy. But these have no roots
 and for a while believe
 but in time of trial go away. ","As for that which fell among thorns
 this is those who hear and go forth
 but are choked with cares
 and with riches and voluptuous living
 and bring forth no fruit. ","As for that in the good ground
 this is those who with a good and pure heart hear the word
 and keep it
 and bring forth fruit with patience.","No man lights a candle and covers it under a vessel
 neither puts it under the table
 but sets it on a candlestick
 so that those who enter in may see the light. ","Nothing is in secret that may not become clear
 nor anything hid that may not be known and come to light. ","Take heed therefore how you hear. For whosoever has
 to him will be given
 and whosoever has not
 from him shall be taken even that same which he supposes that he has.","And they told him
 saying
 Your mother and your brethren are standing outside and want to see you. ","He answered and said to them
 My mother and my brethren are these who hear the word of God and do it.","And it happened on a certain day that he got into a boat
 and his disciples also
 and he said to them
 Let us go over to the other side of the lake. And they launched forth. ","And he said to them
 Where is your faith?","And Jesus asked him
 saying
 What is your name? And he said
 Legion (because many devils were entered into him). ","Go home again into your own house
 and show what great things God has done for you.","And Jesus said
 Who is it that touched me? When everyone denied it
 Peter and those who were with him said
 Master
 the people throng you and crowd you
 and you say
 Who touched me? ","And Jesus said
 Somebody touched me. For I can tell that power has gone out of me.","And he said to her
 Daughter
 be of good comfort. Your faith has made you whole. Go in peace.","When Jesus heard that
 he spoke to the father
 saying
 Fear not; only believe
 and she shall be made whole.","Everybody wept and sorrowed for her. And he said
 Weep not
 for she is not dead
 but sleeping. ","And he put them all out
 and took her by the hand and called
 saying
 Maiden
 arise! ","And he said to them
 Take nothing to support you along the way; neither staff nor bag
 nor bread
 nor money; neither have two coats. ","And whatever house you enter into
 there make your stay
 and from there take your leave. ","And whoever will not receive you
 when you go out of that city
 shake off the very dust from your feet
 for a testimony against them.","But he said to them
 You give them to eat. And they said
 We have no more than five loaves and two fishes
 unless we go and buy food for all these people.","And there were about 5
000 men. And he said to his disciples
 Have them sit down in groups of fifty. ","And it so was
 as he was apart praying
 that his disciples were with him
 and he asked them
 saying
 Who do the people say I am? ","He said to them
 Who do you say that I am? Peter answered and said
 You are the Christ of God. ","saying that the Son of man must suffer many things
 and be reproved by the elders and by the high priests and scribes
 and be slain
 and the third day rise again.","And he said to them all
 if any person would come after me
 let him deny himself
 and take up his cross daily and follow me. ","Whosoever would save his life shall lose it
 but whosoever loses his life for my sake
 he will save it. ","For what does it profit a man to win the whole world
 if he loses himself
 or runs in harm\u2019s way? ","For whoever is ashamed of me and of my sayings
 of him will the Son of man be ashamed when he comes in his own glory
 and in the glory of his Father
 and of the holy angels. ","And I tell you truly
 there are some standing here who will not taste of death till they see the kingdom of God.","And as the men were departing from him
 Peter said to Jesus
 Master
 it is good for us
 being here. Let us make three tabernacles: one for you
 and one for Moses
 and one for Elijah. But he did not know what he was saying. ","Jesus answered and said
 O generation without faith and perverse
 how long shall I be with you and suffer you? Bring your son here.","Let these words sink down into your ears: the time will come when the Son of man will be delivered into the hands of men.","and said to them
 Whoever receives this child in my name
 receives me. And whoever receives me
 receives him who sent me. For he that is least among you all
 the same shall be great.","And Jesus said to him
 Forbid him not. For whoever is not against us
 is with us.","Jesus said to him
 Foxes have holes
 and birds of the air have nests
 but the Son of man has nowhere to lay his head.","And he said to another
 Follow me. And the man said
 Lord
 allow me first to go and bury my father. ","Jesus said to him
 Let the dead bury their dead; but as for you
 go and preach the kingdom of God.","Jesus said to him
 No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God.","And he said to them
 The harvest is great
 but the labourers are few. Pray therefore the Lord of the harvest to send forth labourers into his harvest. ","Go your ways. Behold
 I send you forth as lambs among wolves.","Carry no wallet
 nor bag
 nor shoes
 and address no man by the way. ","Into whatever house you enter
 first say
 Peace be to this house. ","And if a child of peace be there
 your peace will rest upon him; if not
 it will return to you again. ","And in the same house remain
 eating and drinking such things as they have. For the labourer is worthy of his reward. Go not from house to house.","And into whatever town you enter
 if they receive you
 eat such things as are set before you
 ","and heal the sick that are there
 and say to them
 The kingdom of God is come nigh upon you! ","But into whatever town you enter
 if they do not receive you
 go your ways out into the streets of the same and say
 ","Even the very dust that cleaves on us from your city
 we wipe off against you. But yet mark this
 that the kingdom of God came nigh upon you.","Yea and I say to you that it shall be easier in that day for Sodom than for that town.","Woe is to you
 Chorazin! Woe to you
 Bethsaida! For if the miracles had been done in Tyre and Sidon that have been done in you
 they would have repented a great while ago
 sitting in sackcloth and ashes. ","But it will be easier for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you.","And you
 Capernaum
 who are exalted to heaven
 will be thrust down to hell.","He who hears you
 hears me; and he who rejects you
 rejects me; and he who rejects me
 rejects him who sent me.","And he said to them
 I saw Satan
 like lightning as it were
 fall down from heaven. ","Behold
 I give to you power to tread on serpents and scorpions
 and over all manner of power of the enemy
 and nothing shall hurt you. ","Nevertheless
 do not rejoice in this
 that the spirits are under your power
 but rejoice because your names are written in heaven.","At the same time
 Jesus rejoiced in the Spirit and said
 I confess unto you
 Father
 Lord of heaven and earth
 that you have hid these things from the wise and learned
 and revealed them to the babes. Even so
 Father
 for so pleased it you. ","All things are given me by my Father. And no man knows who the Son is except the Father
 nor who the Father is except the Son
 and the person to whom the Son will show him.","And he turned to his disciples and said privately
 Happy are the eyes that see what you see. ","For I tell you that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things that you see
 and have not seen them
 and to hear those things that you hear
 and have not heard them.","And a certain doctor of the law stood up and tested him
 saying
 Teacher
 what must I do to inherit eternal life? ","Jesus said to him
 What is written in the law? How do you read it? ","And Jesus said to him
 You have answered right. This do
 and you shall live. ","Jesus answered and said
 A certain man descended from Jerusalem to Jericho
 and fell into the hands of thieves who robbed him of his clothing and wounded him
 and departed leaving him half dead. ","And by chance there came a certain priest that same way. And when he saw him
 he passed by. ","And likewise a Levite
 when he came near to the place
 went and looked on him
 and passed by. ","Then a certain Samaritan
 as he journeyed
 came near to him
 and when he saw him had compassion on him
 ","and went and bound up his wounds
 and poured in oil and wine. And he put him on his own animal and brought him to a common inn
 and made provision for him. ","And when he departed the next day
 he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper and said to him
 Take care of him; and whatever more you spend
 when I come back
 I will recompense you. ","Which now of these three do you think was neighbour to the man that fell into the thieves\u2019 hands?","And the doctor of law said
 He that showed mercy on him.","And Jesus answered and said to her
 Martha
 Martha
 you care and are troubled about many things. ","Truly one is needful
 and Mary has chosen that good part
 which shall not be taken away from her.","And it happened as he was praying in a certain place that when he ceased
 one of his disciples said to him
 Master
 teach us to pray
 as John taught his disciples. ","And he said to them
 When you pray
 say
 Our Father who art in heaven
 hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done
 even in earth as it is in heaven. ","Give us our daily bread evermore.","And forgive us our sins
 for even we forgive every person that trespasses against us. And lead us not into temptation
 but deliver us from evil.","And he said to them
 If any of you had a friend
 and went to him at midnight and said to him
 Friend
 lend me three loaves
 ","because a friend of mine has come from a journey to me and I have nothing to set before him
 ","and the man inside were to answer and say
 Don\u2019t trouble me; the door is now shut
 and my servants are with me in the chamber; I cannot rise and give them to you \u2013 ","I say to you
 though he would not arise and give him a loaf because he is his friend
 yet because of his importunity he would rise and give him as many as he needed. ","And so I say to you: ask
 and it shall be given you; seek
 and you shall find; knock
 and it shall be opened unto you.","For everyone that asks
 receives
 and he that seeks
 finds
 and to him who knocks
 it will be opened. ","If the son asks for bread from any of you that is a father
 will he give him a stone? Or if he asks for fish
 will he give him a serpent for a fish? ","Or if he asks for an egg
 will he offer him a scorpion? ","If you then who are evil can give good gifts to your children
 how much more will the Father of heaven give a holy spirit to those who desire it of him?\u00a0","And he was a casting out a devil that was dumb. And it followed
 when the devil was gone out
 the dumb man spoke. And the people were filled with wonder. ","But Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them
 Every kingdom divided within itself will be brought to desolation
 and one house will fall upon another. ","So if Satan is divided within himself
 how shall his kingdom endure? For you say that I cast out devils by the power of Beelzebub. ","If I cast out devils by the power of Beelzebub
 by whom do your children cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges. ","But if I with the finger of God cast out devils
 without question the kingdom of God has come upon you.","When a strong man armed guards his house
 that which he possesses is in peace. ","But when one stronger than he comes upon him and overcomes him
 he takes from him his weapons in which he trusted
 and divides up his goods. ","He who is not with me
 is against me. And he who does not gather with me
 scatters.","When the unclean spirit has gone out of a man
 he walks through waterless places
 seeking rest. And when he finds none
 he says
 I will return again to my house from which I came out. ","And when he comes back
 he finds it swept and set in order. ","Then he goes and gets seven other spirits worse than himself
 and they enter in and dwell there
 and the end of that man is worse than the beginning.","And it happened
 as he spoke those things
 a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice and said to him
 Happy is the womb that bore you
 and the paps that gave you suck. ","But he said
 Yea
 happy are those who hear the word of God and keep it.","When the people were gathered thick together
 he began and said
 This is an evil nation. They seek a sign
 but no sign will be given to them except the sign of Jonah the prophet. ","For as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites
 so will the Son of man be to this nation. ","The queen of the south will rise at the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them
 for she came from the end of the world to hear the wisdom of Solomon
 and behold
 one greater than Solomon is here. ","The men of Nineveh will rise at the judgment with this generation and condemn them
 for they repented at the preaching of Jonah
 and behold
 one greater than Jonah is here.","No man lights a candle and puts it in a concealed place
 nor under a bushel
 but on a candlestick
 so that those who come in may see the light. ","The light of your body is the eye. Therefore when your eye is single
 then is all your body full of light. But if your eye is bad
 then shall all your body be full of darkness. ","Take heed therefore that the light which is in you be not darkness.","For if all your body is lighted
 having no part dark
 then shall all be full of light
 even as when a candle lights you with its brightness.","And the Lord said to him
 Now you Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter
 but your inward parts are full of greed and wickedness. ","O foolish men
 did not he who made the outside also make that which is within? ","But rather give alms of what you have
 and behold
 all is clean to you. ","But woe is to you Pharisees. For you tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs
 but pass over justice and the love of God. These you ought to have done
 but yet not have left the others undone.","Woe to you
 Pharisees
 for you love the uppermost seats in the synagogues and greetings in the markets. ","Woe to you
 scribes and Pharisees
 hypocrites! For you are like graves that are not seen
 and the men who walk over them are not aware of them.","Then he said
 Woe is to you also
 doctors of the law. For you load men with burdens grievous to be borne
 and you yourselves do not touch the packs with one of your fingers. ","Woe to you! You build the sepulchres of the prophets
 and your fathers killed them; ","truly you bear witness that you accept the deeds of your fathers
 for they killed them
 and you build their sepulchres. ","Therefore the wisdom of God spoke: I will send them prophets and apostles
 and some they will slay
 and some persecute
 ","so that the blood of all the prophets
 which was shed from the beginning of the world
 may be required of this generation
 ","from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah
 who perished between the altar and the temple. Truly I say to you
 it shall be required of this nation.","Woe to you
 doctors of the law
 for you have taken away the key of knowledge. You yourselves did not enter in
 and those who came in
 you opposed.","As there gathered together an innumerable multitude of people (insomuch that they trod on one another)
 he began and said to his disciples
 First of all
 beware of the leaven of the Pharisees
 which is hypocrisy. ","For there is nothing covered that will not be uncovered
 nor hid that will not be known. ","For whatever you have spoken in darkness
 that same shall be heard in the light. And that which you have spoken in the ear
 even in secret places
 shall be declared even on the top of the houses.","I say to you
 my friends
 do not be afraid of those who kill the body
 and after that have no more that they can do. ","But I will show you whom you should fear: fear him who
 after he has killed
 has power to cast into hell. Yea
 I say to you: him fear!","Are not five sparrows bought for two copper coins? And yet not one of them is forgotten by God.","Indeed
 even the very hairs of your heads are numbered. Fear not
 therefore. You are of more value than many sparrows.","I say to you
 whoever confesses me before men
 him also shall the Son of man confess before the angels of God. ","And he who denies me before men shall be denied before the angels of God.","And whoever speaks a word against the Son of man
 it may be forgiven him; but to him who blasphemes the Holy Spirit
 it will not be forgiven.","When they bring you before the synagogues
 and before the rulers and officers
 take no thought how or what thing to answer
 or what you will say. ","For the Holy Spirit will teach you in that same hour what you ought to say.","And he said to him
 Man
 who made me a judge or a divider over you? ","And he said to them
 Take heed
 and beware of covetousness. For no man\u2019s life stands in the abundance of the things that he possesses.","And he put forth a similitude to them
 saying
 The ground of a certain rich man brought forth fruits plenteously
 ","and he thought in himself
 saying
 What should I do
 since I have no room to store my fruits? ","And he said
 This I will do: I will pull down my barns and build bigger ones
 and there I will store all my fruits and my goods. ","And I will say to my soul
 Soul
 you have goods enough laid up in store for many years; take your ease; eat
 drink
 and be merry! ","But God said to him
 You fool
 this night they will call away your soul back from you. Then whose will be those things that you have laid up?","This is how it is with him who gathers riches
 but is not rich in God.","And he spoke to his disciples: Therefore I say to you
 do not be anxious about your life
 what you will eat; neither for your body
 what you will put on. ","Life is more than food
 and the body is more than clothing. ","Consider the ravens. For they neither sow nor reap
 and have neither storehouse nor barn
 and yet God feeds them. How much more of value are you than the birds? ","Which of you
 with taking thought
 can add one cubit to his stature? ","If you then are not able to do that which is least
 why be anxious about the rest? ","Consider the lilies
 how they grow: they do not labour
 they do not spin
 and yet I say to you that Solomon in all his royalty was not clothed like one of these. ","If God so clothes the grass that is today in the field and tomorrow will be cast into the furnace
 how much more will he clothe you
 O ye of little faith? ","And ask not what you shall eat or what you shall drink
 neither climb up on high. ","For all such things the heathen people of the world seek for. Your Father knows that you have need of such things.","Therefore seek the kingdom of God
 and all these things will be ministered unto you.","Fear not
 little flock
 for it is your Father\u2019s pleasure to give you a kingdom. ","Sell what you have and give alms
 and make yourselves pouches that won\u2019t wear out
 and treasure that won\u2019t fail in heaven
 where no thief comes or moth destroys. ","For where your treasure is
 there will your hearts be also.","Let your loins be girded about and your lights burning
 ","and you yourselves like men waiting for their master
 for when he will return from a wedding
 so that as soon as he comes and knocks
 they can open to him. ","Happy are those servants whom the Lord
 when he comes
 finds watching. Truly I say to you
 he will gird himself about and make them sit down to food
 and walk by and minister to them. ","And if he comes in the second watch
 yea if he comes in the third watch
 and finds them so
 happy are those servants. ","This understand: if the householder knew what hour the thief would come
 he would surely watch
 and not allow his house to be broken into. ","Be prepared therefore
 for the Son of man will come at an hour when you think not.","And the Lord said
 If there be any servant faithful and wise
 whom his lord appoints over his household to give them their portion of food at due season
 ","happy is that servant whom his master
 when he comes
 finds so doing. ","Of a truth I say to you
 he will appoint him over all that he has. ","But if the evil servant says in his heart
 My master will defer his coming
 and begins to smite the menservants and maidservants
 and to eat and drink and to be drunken
 ","the lord of that servant will come in a day when he thinks not
 and at an hour when he is not aware
 and will separate him
 and will give him his reward with the unbelievers.","The servant that knew his master\u2019s will and did not prepare himself
 nor do according to his will
 shall be beaten with many stripes. ","But he who did not know
 and yet committed things worthy of stripes
 will be beaten with few stripes. For to whom much is given
 of him will much be required. And to whom men commit much
 the more will they ask of him.","I have come to send fire on earth. And what is my desire
 but that it were already kindled? ","But I must be baptized with a baptism \u2013 and how I am pained till it be ended!","Do you suppose that I have come to send peace on earth? I tell you no
 but rather division. ","For from henceforth there will be five in one house
 divided three against two
 and two against three. ","The father will be divided against the son
 and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter
 and the daughter against the mother; the mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law
 and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.","Then he said to the people
 When you see a cloud rise out of the west
 straightaway you say we will have a rain shower
 and so it is. ","And when you see the south wind blow
 you say we will have heat
 and it comes to pass. ","Hypocrites
 you know how to interpret the aspect of the earth and of the sky
 but why is it that you cannot interpret this present time?","Yea
 and why do you not judge for yourselves what is right? ","When you go with your adversary to the magistrate
 as you are in the way
 be diligent to be delivered from him
 lest he bring you to the judge
 and the judge commit you to the jailer
 and the jailer cast you into prison. ","I tell you
 you will not get out of there until you have made good the last mite.","And Jesus answered and said to them
 Do you suppose these Galileans were greater sinners than all the other Galileans
 because they suffered such punishment? ","I tell you no
 but unless you repent
 you will all likewise perish. ","Or those eighteen upon whom the tower in Siloam fell and slew them
 do you think they were sinners above all who dwell in Jerusalem? ","I tell you no
 but unless you repent
 you will all likewise perish.","He put forth this similitude: A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard
 and he came and sought fruit on it
 and found none. ","Then he said to the dresser of his vineyard
 Look
 for three years I have come seeking fruit on this fig tree
 and find none. Cut it down. Why is it taking up space on the ground? ","And he answered and said to him
 Lord
 let it alone this year also
 till I dig round about it and dung it to see whether it will bear fruit. ","And if it does not bear then
 after that cut it down.","When Jesus saw her
 he called her to him and said to her
 Woman
 you are delivered from your disease. ","Then the Lord answered him and said
 Hypocrite
 does not each one of you on the Sabbath day loose his ox or his donkey from the stall and lead it to the water? ","And ought not this daughter of Abraham
 whom Satan has bound now eighteen years
 be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath day?","Then he said
 What is the kingdom of God like? or to what shall I compare it? ","Is is like a grain of mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his garden; and it grew
 and developed into a great tree
 and the birds of the air made nests in its branches.","And again he said
 To what may I liken the kingdom of God? ","It is like leaven that a woman took and hid in three bushels of flour until it was leavened right through.","Then someone said to him
 Lord
 are there few that will be saved?","Strive with yourselves to enter in at the strait gate. For many
 I say to you
 will seek to enter in
 and will not be able. ","When the master of the house has risen up and has shut the door to
 you all will begin to stand outside and to knock at the door
 saying
 Lord
 Lord
 open to us! And he will answer and say to you
 I know you not
 where you are from. ","Then you will begin to say
 We have eaten and drunk in your presence
 and you have taught in our streets. ","And he will say
 I tell you
 I do not know you
 where you are from; depart from me
 all you workers of iniquity!","There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God
 and yourselves thrust out at the doors. ","And people will come from the east and from the west
 and from the north and from the south
 and will sit down in the kingdom of God. ","And behold
 there are last who will be first
 and there are first who will be last.","And he said to them
 Go and tell that fox
 behold
 I cast out devils and heal the people today and tomorrow
 and the third day I make an end of it. ","Nevertheless
 I must be going on my way today and tomorrow and the day following
 for it cannot be that a prophet should perish anywhere other than at Jerusalem.","O Jerusalem
 Jerusalem
 who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to you! How often would I have gathered your children together
 like the hen gathers her nest under her wings! But you would not. ","Behold
 your habitation shall be left to you desolate. For I tell you
 you will not see me until the time comes that you say
 Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord.","And Jesus addressed the wise men of law and the Pharisees
 asking
 Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath day? ","And he spoke to them
 saying
 Which of you
 having a donkey or an ox fallen into a pit
 would not straightaway pull him out on the Sabbath day? ","When you are invited to a wedding by anyone
 do not sit down in the highest place
 lest a more honourable man than you be bidden by him
 ","and he who invited both him and you come and say to you
 Make place for this man \u2013 and you then begin with shame to take the lowest seat. ","But rather
 when you are invited
 go and sit in the lowest seat
 so that when he who invited you comes
 he may say to you
 Friend
 sit up higher. Then you will have honour in the presence of those who sit at food with you. ","For whoever exalts himself will be brought low
 and he who humbles himself will be exalted.","Then he said also to the man who had asked him to dinner
 When you give a dinner or a supper
 do not call your friends or your brethren
 neither your kinsfolk or rich neighbours
 lest they return the invitation and a recompense be made you. ","But when you put on a feast
 call the poor
 the maimed
 the lame
 and the blind
 ","and you will be happy; for they cannot recompense you
 but you shall be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.","When one of those who sat at food also heard that
 he said to Jesus
 Happy is he who eats bread in the kingdom of God!\u00a0","Then Jesus said to him
 A certain man prepared a great supper and invited many people. ","And he sent his servant at supper time to say to those who were bidden
 Come
 for all things are now ready. ","And they all at once began to make excuse. The first said to him
 I have bought a farm
 and I need to go and see it; I pray you
 have me excused. ","And another said
 I have bought five yoke of oxen and I\u2019m going to inspect them; I pray you
 have me excused. ","The third said
 I have married a wife
 and therefore I cannot come.","And the servant went and brought his master word of this. Then was the lord of the house displeased
 and said to his servant
 Go out quickly into the streets and quarters of the city
 and bring in here the poor and the maimed and the lame and the blind.","And the servant said
 Lord
 it is done as you ordered
 and still there is room. ","And the lord said to the servant
 Go out into the highways and hedges
 and compel the people to come in
 so that my house may be filled. ","For I say to you that none of those men that were bidden shall taste of my supper.","A great number of people went with Jesus
 and he turned and said to them
 ","If a person comes to me and does not hate his father and mother
 wife
 and children
 and brethren and sisters
 and moreover his own life
 he cannot be my disciple. ","And whoever does not bear his cross and come after me
 cannot be my disciple. ","Which of you
 thinking of building a tower
 would not sit down first and count the cost
 whether he has sufficient to complete it?\u2013 ","lest after he has laid the foundation and is not able to complete it
 all who see it begin to mock him
 ","saying
 This man began to build
 and was not able to finish it. ","Or
 what king goes to make battle against another king
 and does not sit down first and cast in his mind whether he is able with 10
000 to meet him who comes against him with 20
000? ","If not
 while the other is yet a great way off
 he will send ambassadors and seek peace. ","So now then
 none of you who will not renounce all that he has can be my disciple.","Salt is good. But if salt has lost her saltness
 what can be seasoned with it? ","It is neither good for the land
 nor yet for the dunghill
 but men cast it out at the doors. He who has ears to hear
 let him hear.","What man of you
 having a hundred sheep
 if he loses one of them
 does not leave the ninety-nine in the countryside and go after the one that is lost until he finds him? ","And when he has found him
 he puts him on his shoulders with joy. ","And as soon as he comes home
 he calls together his friends and neighbours
 saying to them
 Rejoice with me
 for I have found my sheep that was lost! ","I say to you that likewise there will be joy in heaven over one sinner that repents more than over ninety-nine just persons who need no repentance.","Or what woman who has ten drachmas
 if she loses one
 does not light a lamp
 and sweep the house
 and search diligently till she finds it? ","And when she has found it
 she calls her friends and her neighbours
 saying
 Rejoice with me
 for I have found the drachma that I had lost. ","Likewise I say to you
 there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repents.","And he said
 A certain man had two sons
 ","and the younger of them said to his father
 Father
 give me the part of the goods that belongs to me. And he divided the substance of his wealth between them. ","And not long after
 the younger son gathered all that he had together
 and took his journey into a far country. And there he wasted his goods with riotous living. ","And when he had spent all that he had
 there arose a great dearth throughout all that same land
 and he began to be in want. ","And he went and attached himself to a citizen of that same country
 who sent him to his field to keep his swine. ","And he would gladly have filled his belly with the pods that the swine ate
 but no man gave to him.","Then he came to himself and said
 How many hired servants at my father\u2019s have bread enough
 and I am dying of hunger? ","I will arise and go to my father
 and will say to him
 Father
 I have sinned against heaven and before you
 ","and am no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me like one of your hired servants.","And he arose and went to his father. And when he was yet a great way off
 his father saw him and had compassion
 and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him. ","And the son said to him
 Father
 I have sinned against heaven and in your sight
 and am no longer worthy to be called your son. ","But his father said to his servants
 Bring forth that best garment and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet. ","And bring here the fatted calf and kill it
 and let us eat and be merry. ","For this my son was dead
 and is alive again; he was lost
 and is now found. And they began to be merry.","The elder brother was in the field
 and when he came and drew near to the house
 he heard music and dancing
 ","and called one of his servants and asked what those things meant.","And the servant said to him
 Your brother is come
 and your father had the fatted calf killed
 because he has received him safe and sound.","And the elder brother was angry and would not go in. Then his father came out and entreated him.","He answered and said to his father
 Lo
 these many years I have served you
 and not once broken your commandment
 and yet you never gave me so much as a kid to make merry with my friends. ","But as soon as this your son comes
 who has devoured your goods with harlots
 you have for his pleasure killed the fatted calf!","And the father said to him
 Son
 you were always with me
 and all that I have is yours. ","It was right to make merry and be glad
 for this your brother was dead
 and is alive again
 and was lost
 and is found.","And he said also to his disciples
 There was a certain rich man who had a steward that was accused of wasting his goods. ","And he summoned him and said to him
 How is it that I hear this of you? Give accounts of your stewardship
 for you may no longer be steward.","The steward said within himself
 What can I do? For my master will take away from me the stewardship. I cannot dig
 and to beg I am ashamed. ","I know what to do
 so that when I am put out of the stewardship
 people may receive me into their houses.","Then he called all his master\u2019s debtors
 and said to the first
 How much do you owe to my master? ","And he said
 A hundred tons of oil. And the steward said to him
 Take your bill
 and sit down quickly and write fifty. ","Then he said to another
 What do you owe? And he said
 A hundred quarters of wheat. The steward said to him
 Take your bill and write eighty.","And the lord commended the unjust steward because he had done wisely. For among their own
 the children of this world are wiser than the children of light. ","And I say also to you
 make friends for yourselves with the wicked mammon
 so that when you depart this world
 they may receive you into everlasting habitations.","He who is faithful in that which is least
 the same is faithful in much. And he who is unfaithful in the least is unfaithful also in much. ","So then
 if you have not been faithful in the wicked mammon
 who will believe you in that which is true? ","And if you have not been faithful in another man\u2019s business
 who will give you your own?","No servant can serve two masters. For either he will hate the one and love the other
 or else he will lean to the one and neglect the other. You cannot serve both God and mammon.","And he said to them
 You are those who justify yourselves before men
 but God knows your hearts. For that which is highly esteemed among men
 is abominable in the sight of God.","The law and the prophets reigned until the time of John; and since that time
 the kingdom of God is preached
 and everyone strives to go in.","Sooner can heaven and earth perish
 than one tittle of the law can pass away. ","Whosoever forsakes his wife and marries another
 breaks matrimony
 and every man who marries her that is divorced from her husband
 commits adultery also.","There was a certain rich man that was clothed in purple and fine linen
 and fared deliciously every day. ","And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus who lay at his gate
 full of sores
 ","longing to be relieved of hunger with the crumbs which fell from the rich man\u2019s table. Nevertheless
 the dogs came and licked his sores.","And it came to pass that the beggar died
 and was carried by the angels into Abraham\u2019s bosom. The rich man also died
 and was buried; ","and being in hell
 in torments
 he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham afar off
 and Lazarus in his bosom. ","And he cried out and said
 Father Abraham
 have mercy on me
 and send Lazarus so that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue! For I am tormented in this flame.","But Abraham said to him
 Son
 remember that you in your lifetime received your pleasure
 and contrariwise Lazarus pain. Now therefore he is comforted
 and you are punished. ","Beyond all this
 between all you and us there is a great space set
 so that those who would desire to go from here to you cannot
 and none may come from there to us.","Then he said
 I pray you therefore
 Father
 send him to my father\u2019s house
 ","for I have five brethren
 to warn them
 lest they also come into this place of torment.","Abraham said to him
 They have Moses and the prophets. Let them hear them.","And he said
 Nay
 Father Abraham
 but if one came to them from the dead
 they would repent.","He said to him
 If they do not hear Moses and the prophets
 neither will they believe though one rose from death again.","Then Jesus said to his disciples
 It cannot be avoided but that offences will come. Nevertheless
 woe be to him through whom they come. ","It would be better for him that a millstone were hung about his neck and that he were cast into the sea
 than that he should hurt one of these little ones.","Take heed to yourselves. If your brother trespasses against you
 rebuke him; and if he repents
 forgive him. ","And even if he sins against you seven times in a day
 and seven times in a day turns again to you saying
 I am sorry \u2013 forgive him.","And the Lord said
 If you had faith like a grain of mustard seed
 and were to say to this sycamine tree
 Pluck yourself up by the roots and plant yourself in the sea
 it would obey you.","Who among you
 if he had a servant plowing or feeding sheep
 would say to him when he came in from the field
 Go quickly
 and sit down to food? ","And not rather say to him
 Prepare for me to sup
 and gird yourself up
 and serve me till I have eaten and drunk
 and afterward you shall eat and drink? ","Does he thank that servant because he did that which was commanded of him? I think not.","So likewise you
 when you have done all the things that are commanded of you
 say
 We are unprofitable servants; we have done that which was our duty to do.","And it so was that
 as he journeyed to Jerusalem
 he passed through Samaria and Galilee. ","When he saw them
 he said to them
 Go and show yourselves to the priests. And it came to pass that as they went
 they were cleansed. ","And Jesus answered and said
 Were there not ten cleansed? But where are the other nine? ","There are not found any that returned again to give God praise
 save only this stranger. ","And he said to the man
 Arise and go your way; your faith has made you whole.","When he was asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come
 he answered them and said
 The kingdom of God does not come with watching for it. ","Neither may men say
 See here
 look there! For behold
 the kingdom of God is within you.","And he said to the disciples
 The days will come when you will desire to see one day of the Son of man
 and you will not see it. ","And they will say to you
 See here
 see there! Do not go after them or follow them. ","For as the lightning that appears out of the one part of the heaven and shines to the other part of heaven
 so shall the Son of man be in his days. ","But first he must suffer many things
 and be refused by this nation.","As it happened in the time of Noah
 so shall it be in the time of the Son of man: ","they ate
 they drank
 they married wives
 and were married
 right up to the same day that Noah went into the ark; and the flood came and destroyed them all. ","Likewise also as it happened in the days of Lot: they ate
 they drank
 they bought
 they sold
 they planted
 they built. ","And even the same day that Lot went out of Sodom
 it rained fire and brimstone from heaven
 and destroyed them all. ","After these examples shall it be in the day when the Son of man appears.","At that day
 let him who is on the housetop
 with his stuff in the house
 not come down to take it out. And likewise
 let not him who is in the fields turn back again to what he left behind. ","Remember Lot\u2019s wife.","Whosoever would go about to save his life
 shall lose it
 and whosoever will lose his life
 shall save it. ","I tell you
 in that night there will be two in one bed; the one will be received
 and the other will be left. ","Two will also be a-grinding together; the one will be received
 and the other left.","And they answered and said to him
 Where Lord? And he said to them
 Wherever the body is
 there will the eagles resort.","saying
 There was a judge in a certain city who neither feared God nor regarded man. And there was a certain widow in the same city
 who came to him
 ","saying
 Avenge me of my adversary! ","And he would not for a while. But afterward he said to himself
 Though I do not fear God or care about people
 ","yet because this widow is troubling me
 I will avenge her
 lest she wear me out with nagging.","And the Lord said
 Hear what the unrighteous judge says. ","And will God not avenge his elect who cry day and night to him \u2013 yea
 though he defer them? ","I tell you
 he will avenge them
 and that quickly. Nevertheless
 when the Son of man comes
 do you suppose he will find faith on the earth?","Two men went up into the temple to pray
 the one a Pharisee and the other a publican. ","The Pharisee stood and prayed thus within himself: God
 I thank you that I am not like other men are: extortioners
 unjust
 adulterers \u2013 or like this publican. ","I fast twice in the week; I give tithes of all that I possess.","But the publican stood afar off
 and would not lift up his eyes to heaven
 but smote his breast
 saying
 God be merciful to me
 a sinner. ","I tell you
 this man departed home to his house justified more than the other. For everyone who exalts himself will be brought low
 and he who humbles himself will be exalted.","But Jesus called them to him and said
 Allow the children to come to me
 and do not forbid them. For of such is the kingdom of God. ","Truly I say to you
 whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child
 he shall not enter therein.","Jesus said to him
 Why do you call me good? None is good
 save God only. ","You know the commandments: You shall not commit adultery
 you shall not kill
 you shall not steal
 you shall not bear false witness
 honour your father and your mother.","And he said
 All these I have kept from my youth.","When Jesus heard that
 he said to him
 You lack yet one thing. Sell all that you have
 and distribute it to the poor
 and you will have treasure in heaven; and come
 and follow me.","When Jesus saw him grieve
 he said
 With what difficulty do those who have riches enter into the kingdom of God! ","It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.","And he said
 Things that are impossible with men
 are possible with God.","And he said to them
 Truly I say to you
 there is no man who leaves house
 or father and mother
 or brethren
 or wife
 or children
 for the kingdom of God\u2019s sake
 ","who will not receive much more in this world
 and in the world to come
 everlasting life.","He took the twelve and said to them
 Behold
 we are going up to Jerusalem
 and all things will be fulfilled that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man. ","He will be delivered to the Gentiles
 and will be mocked
 and will be despitefully abused
 and will be spit upon. ","And when they have scourged him
 they will put him to death. And the third day
 he will arise again.","But they understood none of these things. This saying was hid from them
 and they could not perceive the things that were spoken.","What do you want me to do for you? And he said
 Lord
 that I may receive my sight! ","Jesus said to him
 Receive your sight; your faith has saved you. ","And when Jesus came to the place
 he looked up and saw him
 and said to him
 Zacche
 come down at once
 for today I must stay at your house. ","And Zacche stood forth and said to the Lord
 Behold
 Lord: half of my goods I give to the poor
 and if I have done any man wrong
 I will restore him fourfold. ","And Jesus said to him
 This day salvation has come to this house
 seeing that he also has become the child of Abraham. ","For the Son of man has come to seek and to save that which was lost.","He said therefore
 A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive a kingdom for himself
 and then to return. ","And he called his ten servants and gave them ten minas
 saying to them
 Trade with these till I come. ","But his citizens hated him and sent messengers after him
 saying
 We will not have this man to reign over us.","And it came to pass
 when the nobleman returned and had received his kingdom
 he commanded those servants to whom he had given his money to be called to him
 to find out how each had done. ","Then came the first
 saying
 Lord
 your mina has increased ten minas. ","And he said to him
 Well done
 good servant; because you were faithful in a very little thing
 you shall have authority over ten cities. ","And the other came
 saying
 Lord
 your mina has increased five minas. ","And to him he said
 You also shall be over five cities.","And the third came and said
 Lord
 here is your mina
 which I have kept in a napkin. ","For I feared you
 because you are a hard man. You take where you did not invest
 and reap what you did not sow.","And his lord said to him
 By your own mouth I judge you
 you evil servant. You knew that I am a hard man
 taking where I did not invest and reaping what I did not sow? ","Why then didn\u2019t you put my money into the bank
 so that at my coming I could have claimed what is my own with profit?","And he said to those who stood by
 Take from him that mina
 and give it the one who has ten minas. ","And they said to him
 Lord
 he has ten minas!","I say to you that to all those who have
 it will be given
 and from him who has not
 even that which he has will be taken from him. ","Moreover
 those my enemies who did not want me to reign over them
 bring them here and slay them before me.","saying
 Go into the town which is in front of you
 in which
 as soon as you enter
 you will find a colt tied
 on which no man ever yet sat. Untie him and bring him here. ","And if anyone asks you why you are untying him
 thus say to him: The Lord has need of him.","And some of the Pharisees in the company said to him
 Teacher
 rebuke your disciples. ","He answered and said to them
 I tell you
 if these held their peace
 the stones would cry out.","saying
 If only you had known those things that belong to your peace
 at this your very time! But now they are hid from your eyes. ","For the days will come upon you that your enemies will cast up a siege-mound about you
 and compass you around
 and hem you in on every side
 ","and lay you level with the ground
 with your children who are in you. And they will not leave in you one stone upon another
 because you did not acknowledge the time of your visitation.","saying to them
 It is written: My house is the house of prayer. But you have made it a den of thieves.","He answered and said to them
 I also will ask you a question
 and answer me. ","The baptism of John: was it from heaven
 or of men?","And Jesus said to them
 Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.","Then he began and put forth to the people this similitude: A certain man planted a vineyard and let it out to farmers
 and went himself into a far country for a great season. ","And when the time came
 he sent a servant to his tenants
 so that they would give him some of the fruits of the vineyard. But the tenants beat him
 and sent him away empty-handed. ","And again he sent yet another servant. And they beat him and grievously used him also
 and sent him away empty-handed. ","Moreover he sent a third too
 and him they wounded and cast out.","Then said the lord of the vineyard
 What shall I do? I will send my dear son; him perhaps they will respect
 when they see him. ","But when the farmers saw him
 they thought in themselves
 saying
 This is the heir; come
 let us kill him so that the inheritance can be ours. ","And they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him. Now
 what will the lord of the vineyard do to them? ","He will come and destroy these farmers
 and will let out his vineyard to others.","And he looked upon them and said
 What then does this mean that is written: The stone that the builders refused
 the same is made the head cornerstone; ","whosoever stumbles at that stone will be broken
 but on whomever it falls
 it will grind him to powder?","And they watched him
 and sent forth spies who would pretend to be sincere
 to take him in his words
 and to deliver him to the power and authority of the governor. ","Show me a denarius. Whose image and superscription does it have?","And he said to them
 Give then to Caesar that which belongs to Caesar
 and to God that which belongs to God.","And they could not reprove his saying before the people. But they marvelled at his answer
 and held their peace.","Jesus answered and said to them
 The children of this world marry and are married
 ","but those who will be made worthy to enjoy that world
 and the resurrection from death
 neither marry
 nor are married
 ","nor yet can die any more. For they are like the angels
 and are the sons of God
 inasmuch as they are the children of the resurrection. ","And that the dead shall rise again
 even Moses signified in his account of the bush
 when he calls the Lord the God of Abraham
 and the God of Isaac
 and the God of Jacob. ","For he is not the God of the dead
 but of the living. For all live in him.","Then he said to them
 How is it they say that Christ is David\u2019s son? ","And David himself says in the book of the Psalms
 The Lord said to my Lord
 Sit on my right hand
 ","till I make your enemies your footstool.","Seeing David calls him Lord
 how is he then his son?","Beware of the scribes
 who desire to go around in long clothing
 and love greetings in the markets
 the highest seats in the synagogues
 and the places of honour at feasts; ","who devour widows\u2019 houses
 and that under a colour of long praying. The same shall receive greater damnation.","and he said
 Of a truth I say to you
 this poor widow has put in more than all of them. ","For they all have added to the offering to God out of their surplus
 but she
 of her penury
 has cast in all the substance that she had.","The days will come when of these things that you see
 there will not be left stone upon stone that shall not be thrown down. ","And he said
 Take heed that you be not deceived. For many will come in my name
 saying
 I am he. And the time draws near. You must not follow them therefore. ","But when you hear of war and dissension
 do not be afraid. For these things must come first. But the end will not follow immediately.","Then he said to them
 Nation will rise against nation
 and kingdom against kingdom. ","And great earthquakes will be in all quarters
 and hunger and pestilence
 and fearful things. And there will be great signs from heaven. ","But before all these
 they will lay their hands on you and persecute you
 delivering you up to the synagogues and into prison
 and will bring you before kings and rulers for my name\u2019s sake. ","And this will happen to you for a testimony.","Let it therefore stick fast in your hearts not once to concern yourselves beforehand what to answer
 ","for I will give you a mouth and wisdom against which none of your adversaries will be able to speak or resist.","Yea and you will be betrayed by your fathers and mothers
 and by your brethren and kinsmen and friends
 and some of you they will put to death. ","And you will be hated by all men for my name\u2019s sake.","Yet not one hair of your heads shall perish.","With your patience possess your souls.","And when you see Jerusalem besieged with a host
 then understand that its desolation is near. ","Then let the people who are in Judea flee to the mountains
 and let those who are in the city get out. And let not those who are in other countries enter in. ","For these are the days of vengeance
 to fulfil all the things that are written. ","But woe will be to women who are with child and to those who give suck in those days
 for there will be great trouble in the land
 and wrath over all this people. ","And they will fall on the edge of the sword
 and will be led captive into all nations. And Jerusalem will be trodden under foot by the Gentiles
 until the time of the Gentiles is fulfilled.","And there will be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars
 and in the earth the people will be in such perplexity that they will not know which way to turn. The sea and the waters will roar
 ","and men\u2019s hearts will fail them for fear
 and for the dread of those things which shall come on the earth. For the powers of heaven shall move. ","And then shall they see the Son of man come in a cloud
 with power and great glory. ","When these things begin to come to pass
 then look up
 and lift up your heads
 for your redemption draws near.","And he told them a similitude: Consider the fig tree
 and all other trees. ","When they shoot forth their buds
 you see and can tell for your own selves that summer is then nigh at hand. ","So likewise
 when you see these things come to pass
 understand that the kingdom of God is near. ","Truly I say to you
 this generation shall not pass till all be fulfilled. ","Heaven and earth shall pass
 but my words shall not pass.","Take heed to yourselves
 lest your hearts be overcome with excess of eating
 and drunkenness
 and worldly cares
 and that day come on you unawares. ","For as a snare shall it come upon all who sit on the face of the earth.","Watch therefore continually
 and pray that you may obtain grace to escape all this that is to come
 and that you may stand before the Son of man.","And Jesus sent Peter and John
 saying
 Go and prepare for us the Passover lamb so that we may eat. ","And he said to them
 When you have entered into the city
 there a man bearing a pitcher of water will meet you. Follow him into the same house that he enters in
 ","and say to the head of the house
 The Master says to you
 where is the guest chamber
 where I may eat my Passover lamb with my disciples? ","And he will show you a large upper room furnished. There make ready.","And he said to them
 I have inwardly desired to eat this Passover lamb with you before I suffer. ","For I say to you
 henceforth I will not eat of it any more until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God. ","And he took the cup and gave thanks and said
 Take this
 and divide it among you. ","For I say to you
 I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God has come.","And he took bread
 gave thanks
 and gave to them
 saying
 This is my body
 which is given for you. This do in the remembrance of me. ","Likewise also
 when they had supped
 he took the cup
 saying
 This cup is the new testament in my blood
 which shall be shed for you. ","Yet behold
 the hand of him who betrays me is with me on the table. ","And the Son of man goes as it is appointed; but woe be to that man by whom he is betrayed.","And he said to them
 The kings of the Gentiles reign over them
 and those who bear rule over them are called gracious lords. ","But you shall not be like this. Rather
 he who is greatest among you shall be as the youngest
 and he who is chief shall be as the servant. ","For who is greater: he who sits at food
 or he that serves? Is it not he who sits at food? But I am among you as he that serves. ","And you are those who have stayed with me in my trials.","And I appoint unto you a kingdom
 as my Father has appointed to me
 ","so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom
 and sit upon seats
 and judge the twelve tribes of Israel.","And the Lord said
 Simon
 Simon
 behold: Satan has desired you all
 to sift you like wheat. ","But I have prayed for you
 Simon
 that your faith should not fail. And when you have turned back again
 strengthen your brethren. ","And Peter said to him
 Lord
 I am ready to go with you into prison
 and to death. ","And he said
 I tell you
 Peter
 the cock will not crow this day till you have three times denied that you knew me.","And he said to them
 When I sent you out without wallet or bag or shoes
 did you lack anything? And they said
 No. ","And he said to them
 But now
 let him who has a wallet take it up
 and likewise his bag. And he who has no sword
 let him sell his coat and buy one. ","For I say to you that that which is written must yet be performed in me: Even with the wicked was he numbered. For those things which are written of me have their fulfilment.","And they said
 Lord
 see
 here are two swords.","And when he came to the place
 he said to them
 Pray
 lest you fall into temptation. ","Father
 if you will
 withdraw this cup from me. Nevertheless
 not my will
 but yours be fulfilled.","and said to them
 Why do you sleep? Rise and pray
 lest you fall into temptation.","And Jesus said to him
 Judas
 do you betray the Son of man with a kiss?","But Jesus answered and said
 Let it come to this. And he touched the servant\u2019s ear and healed him.","Then Jesus said to the high priests and officers of the temple
 and the elders who had approached him
 Have you come out as if to a thief
 with swords and clubs? ","When I was daily with you in the temple
 you did not stretch forth hands against me. But this is even your very hour
 and the power of darkness.","And the Lord turned back and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the words of the Lord
 how he said to him
 Before the cock crows
 you will deny me three times. ","Are you the very Christ? Tell us.","And also if I ask you
 you will not answer me or let me go. ","Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God.","Then they all said
 Are you then the Son of God?","And Pilate questioned him
 saying
 Are you the king of the Jews? He answered him and said
 It is as you say.","When Pilate heard mention of Galilee
 he asked whether the man was from Galilee. ","and said to them
 You have brought this man to me as one who incited uprising among the people. But I have examined him before you
 and have found no fault in this man concerning those things that you accuse him of. ","He said to them the third time
 What evil has he done? I find no cause of death in him. I will therefore chastise him and release him.","But Jesus turned back to them and said
 Daughters of Jerusalem
 weep not for me
 but weep for yourselves and for your children. ","For behold
 the days will come when men will say
 Happy are the barren
 and the wombs that never bore
 and the paps that never gave suck. ","Then will they begin to say to the mountains
 Fall on us! and to the hills
 Cover us! ","For if they do this to a green tree
 what shall be done to the dry?","Then said Jesus
 Father
 forgive them
 for they know not what they do.","And Jesus said to him
 Truly I say to you
 today you shall be with me in Paradise.","And Jesus cried with a great voice and said
 Father
 into your hands I commit my spirit. And when he had thus spoken
 he gave up the spirit.","And as the women became afraid and bowed down their faces to the earth
 they said to them
 Why do you seek the living among the dead? He is not here
 but is risen. ","And he said to them
 What sort of conversations are these that you are having with each other as you walk and are sad?","Jesus said to them
 What things?","And he said to them
 O foolish ones
 and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! ","Ought not the Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory?","As they were thus speaking
 Jesus himself stood in the midst of them and said to them
 Peace be with you. ","And he said to them
 Why are you troubled
 and why do doubts arise in your hearts? ","Behold my hands and my feet
 that it is even I myself. Handle me and see. For spirits do not have flesh and bones
 as you see me to have.","And while they still could not believe for joy and wonderment
 he said to them
 Have you any food here? ","And he said to them
 These are the things that I told to you while I was still with you: that all must be fulfilled that was written about me in the law of Moses
 and in the Prophets
 and in the Psalms.","and said to them
 Thus it is written
 and thus it was necessary for Christ to suffer
 and to rise again from death the third day
 ","and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations
 and must begin at Jerusalem. ","And you are witnesses of these things.","And behold
 I will send the promise of my Father upon you. But stay in the city of Jerusalem until you are endued with power from on high.","Yeshua said to them
 \u201cWhy were you looking for me? Didn\u2019t you realize that I had to be in my Father\u2019s house?\u201d ","Yeshua answered him
 \u201cScripture says
 \u2018A person cannot live on bread alone.\u2019\u201d","The devil said to him
 \u201cI will give you all the power and glory of these kingdoms. All of it has been given to me
 and I give it to anyone I please. ","Yeshua answered him
 \u201cScripture says
 \u2018Worship the Lord your God and serve only him.\u2019\u201d","Then the devil took him into Jerusalem and had him stand on the highest part of the temple. He said to Yeshua
 \u201cIf you are the Son of God
 jump from here! ","Yeshua answered him
 \u201cIt has been said
 \u2018Never tempt the Lord your God.\u2019\u201d","\u201cThe Spirit of the Lord is with me. He has anointed me to tell the Good News to the poor. He has sent me to announce forgiveness to the prisoners of sin and the restoring of sight to the blind
 to forgive those who have been shattered by sin
","to announce the year of the Lord\u2019s favor.\u201d","Then he said to them
 \u201cThis passage came true today when you heard me read it.\u201d","So he said to them
 \u201cYou\u2019ll probably quote this proverb to me
 \u2018Doctor
 cure yourself!\u2019 and then say to me
 \u2018Do all the things in your hometown that we\u2019ve heard you\u2019ve done in Capernaum.\u2019\u201d ","Then Yeshua added
 \u201cI can guarantee this truth: A prophet isn\u2019t accepted in his hometown.","\u201cI can guarantee this truth: There were many widows in Israel in Elijah\u2019s time. It had not rained for three-and-a-half years
 and the famine was severe everywhere in the country. ","But God didn\u2019t send Elijah to anyone except a widow at Zarephath in the territory of Sidon.","There were also many people with skin diseases in Israel in the prophet Elisha\u2019s time. But God cured no one except Naaman from Syria.\u201d","The people were amazed at his teachings because he spoke with authority.","Yeshua ordered the spirit
 \u201cKeep quiet
 and come out of him!\u201d The demon threw the man down in the middle of the synagogue and came out without hurting him.","Demons came out of many people
 shouting
 \u201cYou are the Son of God!\u201d But Yeshua ordered them not to speak. After all
 they knew he was the Messiah.","But he said to them
 \u201cI have to tell the Good News about the kingdom of God in other cities also. That\u2019s what I was sent to do.\u201d","When he finished speaking
 he told Simon
 \u201cTake the boat into deep water
 and lower your nets to catch some fish.\u201d","James and John
 who were Zebedee\u2019s sons and Simon\u2019s partners
 were also amazed. Yeshua told Simon
 \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. From now on you will catch people instead of fish.\u201d","Yeshua reached out
 touched him
 and said
 \u201cI want to. So be clean!\u201d Immediately
 his skin disease went away.","Yeshua ordered him
 \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone. Instead
 show yourself to the priest. Then offer the sacrifice as Moses commanded as proof to people that you are clean.\u201d","When Yeshua saw their faith
 he said
 \u201cSir
 your sins are forgiven.\u201d ","Yeshua knew what they were thinking. So he said to them
 \u201cWhat are you thinking? ","Is it easier to say
 \u2018Your sins are forgiven
\u2019 or to say
 \u2018Get up and walk\u2019? ","I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.\u201d Then he said to the paralyzed man
 \u201cGet up
 pick up your stretcher
 and go home.\u201d","After that
 Yeshua left. He saw a tax collector named Levi sitting in a tax office. Yeshua said to him
 \u201cFollow me!\u201d ","Yeshua answered them
 \u201cHealthy people don\u2019t need a doctor; those who are sick do. ","I\u2019ve come to call sinners to change the way they think and act
 not to call people who think they have God\u2019s approval.\u201d","They said to him
 \u201cJohn\u2019s disciples frequently fast and say prayers
 and so do the disciples of the Pharisees. But your disciples eat and drink.\u201d","Yeshua asked them
 \u201cCan you force wedding guests to fast while the groom is still with them? ","The time will come when the groom will be taken away from them. At that time they will fast.\u201d","He also used these illustrations: \u201cNo one tears a piece of cloth from a new coat to patch an old coat. Otherwise
 the new cloth will tear the old. Besides
 the patch from the new will not match the old. ","People don\u2019t pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do
 the new wine will make the skins burst. The wine will run out
 and the skins will be ruined. ","Rather
 new wine is to be poured into fresh skins.","\u201cNo one who has been drinking old wine wants new wine. He says
 \u2018The old wine is better!\u2019\u201d","Yeshua answered them
 \u201cHaven\u2019t you read what David did when he and his men were hungry? ","Haven\u2019t you read how he went into the house of God
 ate the bread of the presence
 and gave some of it to the men who were with him? He had no right to eat those loaves. Only the priests have that right.\u201d","Then he added
 \u201cThe Son of Man has authority over the day of worship.\u201d","But Yeshua knew what they were thinking. So he told the man with the paralyzed hand
 \u201cGet up
 and stand in the center of the synagogue!\u201d The man got up and stood there. ","Then Yeshua said to them
 \u201cI ask you\u2014what is the right thing to do on a day of worship: to do good or evil
 to give a person his health or to destroy it?\u201d ","He looked around at all of them and then said to the man
 \u201cHold out your hand.\u201d The man did so
 and his hand became normal again.","Blessed are those who are hungry. They will be satisfied. Blessed are those who are crying. They will laugh.","Blessed are you when people hate you
 avoid you
 insult you
 and slander you because you are committed to the Son of Man.","Rejoice then
 and be very happy! You have a great reward in heaven. That\u2019s the way their ancestors treated the prophets.","\u201cBut how horrible it will be for those who are rich. They have had their comfort.","How horrible it will be for those who are well-fed. They will be hungry. How horrible it will be for those who are laughing. They will mourn and cry.","How horrible it will be for you when everyone says nice things about you. That\u2019s the way their ancestors treated the false prophets.","\u201cBut I tell everyone who is listening: Love your enemies. Be kind to those who hate you.","Bless those who curse you. Pray for those who insult you.","If someone strikes you on the cheek
 offer the other cheek as well. If someone takes your coat
 don\u2019t stop him from taking your shirt. ","Give to everyone who asks you for something. If someone takes what is yours
 don\u2019t insist on getting it back.","\u201cDo for other people everything you want them to do for you.","\u201cIf you love those who love you
 do you deserve any thanks for that? Even sinners love those who love them. ","If you help those who help you
 do you deserve any thanks for that? Sinners do that too. ","If you lend anything to those from whom you expect to get something back
 do you deserve any thanks for that? Sinners also lend to sinners to get back what they lend. ","Rather
 love your enemies
 help them
 and lend to them without expecting to get anything back. Then you will have a great reward. You will be the children of the Most High God. After all
 he is kind to unthankful and evil people. ","Be merciful as your Father is merciful.","\u201cStop judging
 and you will never be judged. Stop condemning
 and you will never be condemned. Forgive
 and you will be forgiven. ","Give
 and you will receive. A large quantity
 pressed together
 shaken down
 and running over will be put into your pocket. The standards you use for others will be applied to you.\u201d","Yeshua also gave them this illustration: \u201cCan one blind person lead another? Won\u2019t both fall into the same pit?","A student is no better than his teacher. But everyone who is well-trained will be like his teacher.","\u201cWhy do you see the piece of sawdust in another believer\u2019s eye and not notice the wooden beam in your own eye?","How can you say to another believer
 \u2018Friend
 let me take the piece of sawdust out of your eye
\u2019 when you don\u2019t see the beam in your own eye? You hypocrite! First remove the beam from your own eye. Then you will see clearly to remove the piece of sawdust from another believer\u2019s eye.","\u201cA good tree doesn\u2019t produce rotten fruit
 and a rotten tree doesn\u2019t produce good fruit. ","Each tree is known by its fruit. You don\u2019t pick figs from thorny plants or grapes from a thornbush.","Good people do the good that is in them. But evil people do the evil that is in them. The things people say come from inside them.","\u201cWhy do you call me Lord but don\u2019t do what I tell you?","\u201cI will show you what everyone who comes to me
 hears what I say
 and obeys it is like. ","He is like a person who dug down to bedrock to lay the foundation of his home. When a flood came
 the floodwaters pushed against that house. But the house couldn\u2019t be washed away because it had a good foundation. ","The person who hears what I say but doesn\u2019t obey it is like someone who built a house on the ground without any foundation. The floodwaters pushed against it
 and that house quickly collapsed and was destroyed.\u201d","Yeshua was amazed at the officer when he heard these words. He turned to the crowd following him and said
 \u201cI can guarantee that I haven\u2019t found faith as great as this in Israel.\u201d","When the Lord saw her
 he felt sorry for her. He said to her
 \u201cDon\u2019t cry.\u201d","He went up to the open coffin
 took hold of it
 and the men who were carrying it stopped. He said
 \u201cYoung man
 I\u2019m telling you to come back to life!\u201d ","Yeshua answered John\u2019s disciples
 \u201cGo back
 and tell John what you have seen and heard: Blind people see again
 lame people are walking
 those with skin diseases are made clean
 deaf people hear again
 dead people are brought back to life
 and poor people hear the Good News. ","Whoever doesn\u2019t lose his faith in me is indeed blessed.\u201d","When John\u2019s messengers had left
 Yeshua spoke to the crowds about John. \u201cWhat did you go into the desert to see? Tall grass swaying in the wind? ","Really
 what did you go to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? Those who wear splendid clothes and live in luxury are in royal palaces. ","Really
 what did you go to see? A prophet? Let me tell you that he is far more than a prophet. ","John is the one about whom Scripture says
 \u2018I am sending my messenger ahead of you to prepare the way in front of you.\u2019","I can guarantee that of all the people ever born
 no one is greater than John. Yet
 the least important person in the kingdom of God is greater than John.","\u201cHow can I describe the people who are living now? What are they like?","They are like children who sit in the marketplace and shout to each other
 \u2018We played music for you

 \u2018There\u2019s a demon in him!\u2019 ","The Son of Man has come eating and drinking
 and you say
 \u2018Look at him! He\u2019s a glutton and a drunk
 a friend of tax collectors and sinners!\u2019","\u201cYet
 wisdom is proved right by all its results.\u201d","The Pharisee who had invited Yeshua saw this and thought
 \u201cIf this man really were a prophet
 he would know what sort of woman is touching him. She\u2019s a sinner.\u201d","Yeshua spoke up
 \u201cSimon
 I have something to say to you.\u201d Simon replied
 \u201cTeacher
 you\u2019re free to speak.\u201d","So Yeshua said
 \u201cTwo men owed a moneylender some money. One owed him five hundred silver coins
 and the other owed him fifty. ","When they couldn\u2019t pay it back
 he was kind enough to cancel their debts. Now
 who do you think will love him the most?\u201d","Simon answered
 \u201cI suppose the one who had the largest debt canceled.\u201d Yeshua said to him
 \u201cYou\u2019re right!\u201d ","Then
 turning to the woman
 he said to Simon
 \u201cYou see this woman
 don\u2019t you? I came into your house. You didn\u2019t wash my feet. But she has washed my feet with her tears and dried them with her hair. ","You didn\u2019t give me a kiss. But ever since I came in
 she has not stopped kissing my feet. ","You didn\u2019t put any olive oil on my head. But she has poured perfume on my feet.","That\u2019s why I\u2019m telling you that her many sins have been forgiven. Her great love proves that. But whoever receives little forgiveness loves very little.\u201d","Then Yeshua said to her
 \u201cYour sins have been forgiven.\u201d ","Yeshua said to the woman
 \u201cYour faith has saved you. Go in peace!\u201d","When a large crowd had gathered and people had come to Yeshua from every city
 he used this story as an illustration: ","\u201cA farmer went to plant his seeds. Some seeds were planted along the road
 were trampled
 and were devoured by birds. ","Others were planted on rocky soil. When the plants came up
 they withered because they had no moisture. ","Others were planted among thornbushes. The thornbushes grew up with them and choked them.","Others were planted on good ground. When they came up
 they produced a hundred times as much as was planted.\u201d After he had said this
 he called out
 \u201cLet the person who has ears listen!\u201d","Yeshua answered
 \u201cKnowledge about the mysteries of the kingdom of God has been given directly to you. But it is given to others in stories. When they look
 they don\u2019t see
 and when they hear
 they don\u2019t understand.","\u201cThis is what the story illustrates: The seed is God\u2019s word.","Some people are like seeds that were planted along the road. They hear the word
 but then the devil comes. He takes the word away from them so that they don\u2019t believe and become saved. ","Some people are like seeds on rocky soil. They welcome the word with joy whenever they hear it
 but they don\u2019t develop any roots. They believe for a while
 but when their faith is tested
 they abandon it. ","The seeds that were planted among thornbushes are people who hear the word
 but as life goes on the worries
 riches
 and pleasures of life choke them. So they don\u2019t produce anything good. ","The seeds that were planted on good ground are people who also hear the word. But they keep it in their good and honest hearts and produce what is good despite what life may bring.","\u201cNo one lights a lamp and hides it under a bowl or puts it under a bed. Instead
 everyone who lights a lamp puts it on a lamp stand so that those who come in will see the light. ","There is nothing hidden that will not be revealed. There is nothing kept secret that will not come to light.","\u201cSo pay attention to how you listen! Those who understand these mysteries will be given more knowledge. However
 some people don\u2019t understand these mysteries. Even what they think they understand will be taken away from them.\u201d","Someone told Yeshua
 \u201cYour mother and your brothers are standing outside. They want to see you.\u201d","He answered them
 \u201cMy mother and my brothers are those who hear and do what God\u2019s word says.\u201d","One day Yeshua and his disciples got into a boat. He said to them
 \u201cLet\u2019s cross to the other side of the lake.\u201d So they started out. ","He asked them
 \u201cWhere is your faith?\u201d Frightened and amazed
 they asked each other
 \u201cWho is this man? He gives orders to the wind and the water
 and they obey him!\u201d","Yeshua asked him
 \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d He answered
 \u201cLegion [Six Thousand].\u201d (Many demons had entered him.) ","\u201cGo home to your family
 and tell them how much God has done for you.\u201d So the man left. He went through the whole city and told people how much Yeshua had done for him.","Yeshua asked
 \u201cWho touched me?\u201d After everyone denied touching him
 Peter said
 \u201cTeacher
 the people are crowding you and pressing against you.\u201d","Yeshua said
 \u201cSomeone touched me. I know power has gone out of me.\u201d","Yeshua told her
 \u201cDaughter
 your faith has made you well. Go in peace!\u201d","When Yeshua heard this
 he told the synagogue leader
 \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid! Just believe
 and she will get well.\u201d","Everyone was crying and showing how sad they were. Yeshua said
 \u201cDon\u2019t cry! She\u2019s not dead. She\u2019s just sleeping.\u201d","But Yeshua took her hand and called out
 \u201cChild
 get up!\u201d ","He told them
 \u201cDon\u2019t take anything along on the trip. Don\u2019t take a walking stick
 traveling bag
 any food
 money
 or a change of clothes. ","When you go into a home
 stay there until you\u2019re ready to leave. ","If people don\u2019t welcome you
 leave that city
 and shake its dust off your feet as a warning to them.\u201d","Yeshua replied
 \u201cYou give them something to eat.\u201d They said to him
 \u201cWe have five loaves of bread and two fish. Unless we go to buy food for all these people
 that\u2019s all we have.\u201d ","(There were about five thousand men.) Then he told his disciples
 \u201cHave them sit in groups of about fifty.\u201d ","Once when Yeshua was praying privately and his disciples were with him
 he asked them
 \u201cWho do people say I am?\u201d","He asked them
 \u201cBut who do you say I am?\u201d Peter answered
 \u201cYou are the Messiah
 whom God has sent.\u201d","Yeshua said that the Son of Man would have to suffer a lot. He would be rejected by the leaders
 the chief priests
 and the experts in Moses\u2019 Teachings. He would be killed
 but on the third day he would come back to life.","He said to all of them
 \u201cThose who want to come with me must say no to the things they want
 pick up their crosses every day
 and follow me. ","Those who want to save their lives will lose them. But those who lose their lives for me will save them.","What good does it do for people to win the whole world but lose their lives by destroying them?","If people are ashamed of me and what I say
 the Son of Man will be ashamed of those people when he comes in the glory that he shares with the Father and the holy angels.","\u201cI can guarantee this truth: Some people who are standing here will not die until they see the kingdom of God.\u201d","As Moses and Elijah were leaving him
 Peter said to Yeshua
 \u201cTeacher
 it\u2019s good that we\u2019re here. Let\u2019s put up three tents\u2014one for you
 one for Moses
 and one for Elijah.\u201d Peter didn\u2019t know what he was saying.","Yeshua answered
 \u201cYou unbelieving and corrupt generation! How long must I be with you and put up with you? Bring your son here!\u201d","\u201cListen carefully to what I say. The Son of Man will be betrayed and handed over to people.\u201d","Then he said to them
 \u201cWhoever welcomes this little child in my name welcomes me. Whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me. The one who is least among all of you is the one who is greatest.\u201d","Yeshua said to him
 \u201cDon\u2019t stop him! Whoever isn\u2019t against you is for you.\u201d","Yeshua told him
 \u201cFoxes have holes
 and birds have nests
 but the Son of Man has nowhere to sleep.\u201d","He told another man
 \u201cFollow me!\u201d But the man said
 \u201cSir
 first let me go to bury my father.\u201d","But Yeshua told him
 \u201cLet the dead bury their own dead. You must go everywhere and tell about the kingdom of God.\u201d","Yeshua said to him
 \u201cWhoever starts to plow and looks back is not fit for the kingdom of God.\u201d","He told them
 \u201cThe harvest is large
 but the workers are few. So ask the Lord who gives this harvest to send workers to harvest his crops. ","Go! I\u2019m sending you out like lambs among wolves.","Don\u2019t carry a wallet

 your greeting will be accepted. But if that\u2019s not the case
 your greeting will be rejected. ","Stay with the family that accepts you. Eat and drink whatever they offer you. After all

 his father
 for a fish

 it finds the house swept clean and in order. ","Then the spirit goes and brings along seven other spirits more evil than itself. They enter and take up permanent residence there. In the end the condition of that person is worse than it was before.\u201d","While Yeshua was speaking

 \u201cHow horrible it will be for you experts in Moses\u2019 Teachings! You burden people with loads that are hard to carry. But you won\u2019t lift a finger to carry any of these loads.","\u201cHow horrible it will be for you! You build the monuments for the prophets. But it was your ancestors who murdered them.","So you are witnesses and approve of what your ancestors did. They murdered the prophets for whom you build monuments.","That\u2019s why the Wisdom of God said
 \u2018I will send them prophets and apostles. They will murder some of those prophets and apostles and persecute others.\u2019 ","So the people living now will be charged with the murder of every prophet since the world was made.","This includes the murders from Abel to Zechariah
 who was killed between the altar and the temple. Yes
 I can guarantee this truth: The people living today will be held responsible for this.","\u201cHow horrible it will be for you experts in Moses\u2019 Teachings! You have taken away the key that unlocks knowledge. You haven\u2019t gained entrance into knowledge yourselves
 and you\u2019ve kept out those who wanted to enter.\u201d","Meanwhile
 thousands of people had gathered. They were so crowded that they stepped on each other. Yeshua spoke to his disciples and said
 \u201cWatch out for the yeast of the Pharisees. I\u2019m talking about their hypocrisy. ","Nothing has been covered that will not be exposed. Whatever is secret will be made known.","Whatever you have said in the dark will be heard in the daylight. Whatever you have whispered in private rooms will be shouted from the housetops.","\u201cMy friends
 I can guarantee that you don\u2019t need to be afraid of those who kill the body. After that they can\u2019t do anything more. ","I\u2019ll show you the one you should be afraid of. Be afraid of the one who has the power to throw you into hell after killing you. I\u2019m warning you to be afraid of him.","\u201cAren\u2019t five sparrows sold for two cents? God doesn\u2019t forget any of them.","Even every hair on your head has been counted. Don\u2019t be afraid! You are worth more than many sparrows.","I can guarantee that the Son of Man will acknowledge in front of God\u2019s angels every person who acknowledges him in front of others.","But God\u2019s angels will be told that I don\u2019t know those people who tell others that they don\u2019t know me.","Everyone who says something against the Son of Man will be forgiven. But the person who dishonors the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.","\u201cWhen you are put on trial in synagogues or in front of rulers and authorities
 don\u2019t worry about how you will defend yourselves or what you will say. ","At that time the Holy Spirit will teach you what you must say.\u201d","Yeshua said to him
 \u201cWho appointed me to be your judge or to divide your inheritance?\u201d","He told the people
 \u201cBe careful to guard yourselves from every kind of greed. Life is not about having a lot of material possessions.\u201d","Then he used this illustration. He said
 \u201cA rich man had land that produced good crops. ","He thought
 \u2018What should I do? I don\u2019t have enough room to store my crops.\u2019 ","He said
 \u2018I know what I\u2019ll do. I\u2019ll tear down my barns and build bigger ones so that I can store all my grain and goods in them. ","Then I\u2019ll say to myself
 \u201cYou\u2019ve stored up a lot of good things for years to come. Take life easy
 eat
 drink
 and enjoy yourself.\u201d \u2019","\u201cBut God said to him
 \u2018You fool! I will demand your life from you tonight! Now who will get what you\u2019ve accumulated?\u2019 ","That\u2019s how it is when a person has material riches but is not rich in his relationship with God.\u201d","Then Yeshua said to his disciples
 \u201cSo I tell you to stop worrying about what you will eat or wear. ","Life is more than food
 and the body is more than clothes. ","Consider the crows. They don\u2019t plant or harvest. They don\u2019t even have a storeroom or a barn. Yet
 God feeds them. You are worth much more than birds.","\u201cCan any of you add an hour to your life by worrying?","If you can\u2019t do a small thing like that
 why worry about other things? ","Consider how the flowers grow. They never work or spin yarn for clothes. But I say that not even Solomon in all his majesty was dressed like one of these flowers.","That\u2019s the way God clothes the grass in the field. Today it\u2019s alive
 and tomorrow it\u2019s thrown into an incinerator. So how much more will he clothe you people who have so little faith?","\u201cDon\u2019t concern yourself about what you will eat or drink
 and quit worrying about these things. ","Everyone in the world is concerned about these things
 but your Father knows you need them. ","Rather
 be concerned about his kingdom. Then these things will be provided for you. ","Don\u2019t be afraid
 little flock. Your Father is pleased to give you the kingdom.","\u201cSell your material possessions
 and give the money to the poor. Make yourselves wallets that don\u2019t wear out! Make a treasure for yourselves in heaven that never loses its value! In heaven thieves and moths can\u2019t get close enough to destroy your treasure. ","Your heart will be where your treasure is.","\u201cBe ready for action
 and have your lamps burning. ","Be like servants waiting to open the door at their master\u2019s knock when he returns from a wedding.","Blessed are those servants whom the master finds awake when he comes. I can guarantee this truth: He will change his clothes
 make them sit down at the table
 and serve them. ","They will be blessed if he comes in the middle of the night or toward morning and finds them awake.","\u201cOf course
 you realize that if the homeowner had known at what hour the thief was coming
 he would not have let him break into his house. ","Be ready
 because the Son of Man will return when you least expect him.\u201d","The Lord asked
 \u201cWho
 then
 is the faithful
 skilled manager that the master will put in charge of giving the other servants their share of food at the right time? ","That servant will be blessed if his master finds him doing this job when he comes.","I can guarantee this truth: He will put that servant in charge of all his property.","On the other hand
 that servant may think that his master is taking a long time to come home. The servant may begin to beat the other servants and to eat
 drink
 and get drunk. ","His master will return at an unexpected time. Then his master will punish him severely and assign him a place with unfaithful people.","\u201cThe servant who knew what his master wanted but didn\u2019t get ready to do it will receive a hard beating.","But the servant who didn\u2019t know what his master wanted and did things for which he deserved punishment will receive a light beating. A lot will be expected from everyone who has been given a lot. More will be demanded from everyone who has been entrusted with a lot.","\u201cI have come to throw fire on the earth. I wish that it had already started!","I have a baptism to go through
 and I will suffer until it is over.","\u201cDo you think I came to bring peace to earth? No! I can guarantee that I came to bring nothing but division.","From now on a family of five will be divided. Three will be divided against two and two against three.","A father will be against his son and a son against his father. A mother will be against her daughter and a daughter against her mother. A mother-in-law will be against her daughter-in-law and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.\u201d","Yeshua said to the crowds
 \u201cWhen you see a cloud coming up in the west
 you immediately say
 \u2018There\u2019s going to be a rainstorm
\u2019 and it happens. ","When you see a south wind blowing
 you say
 \u2018It\u2019s going to be hot
\u2019 and that\u2019s what happens. ","You hypocrites! You can forecast the weather by judging the appearance of earth and sky. But for some reason you don\u2019t know how to judge the time in which you\u2019re living.","So why don\u2019t you judge for yourselves what is right?","For instance
 when an opponent brings you to court in front of a ruler
 do your best to settle with him before you get there. Otherwise
 he will drag you in front of a judge. The judge will hand you over to an officer who will throw you into prison. ","I can guarantee that you won\u2019t get out until you pay every penny of your fine.\u201d","Yeshua replied to them
 \u201cDo you think that this happened to them because they were more sinful than other people from Galilee? ","No! I can guarantee that they weren\u2019t. But if you don\u2019t turn to God and change the way you think and act
 then you
 too
 will all die. ","What about those 18 people who died when the tower at Siloam fell on them? Do you think that they were more sinful than other people living in Jerusalem?","No! I can guarantee that they weren\u2019t. But if you don\u2019t turn to God and change the way you think and act
 then you
 too
 will all die.\u201d","Then Yeshua used this illustration: \u201cA man had a fig tree growing in his vineyard. He went to look for fruit on the tree but didn\u2019t find any.","He said to the gardener
 \u2018For the last three years I\u2019ve come to look for figs on this fig tree but haven\u2019t found any. Cut it down! Why should it use up good soil?\u2019","\u201cThe gardener replied
 \u2018Sir
 let it stand for one more year. I\u2019ll dig around it and fertilize it. ","Maybe next year it\u2019ll have figs. But if not
 then cut it down.\u2019\u201d","When Yeshua saw her
 he called her to come to him and said
 \u201cWoman
 you are free from your disability.\u201d ","The Lord said
 \u201cYou hypocrites! Don\u2019t each of you free your ox or donkey on the day of worship? Don\u2019t you then take it out of its stall to give it some water to drink? ","Now
 here is a descendant of Abraham. Satan has kept her in this condition for 18 years. Isn\u2019t it right to free her on the day of worship?\u201d","Yeshua asked
 \u201cWhat is the kingdom of God like? What can I compare it to? ","It\u2019s like a mustard seed that someone planted in a garden. It grew and became a tree
 and the birds nested in its branches.\u201d","He asked again
 \u201cWhat can I compare the kingdom of God to? ","It\u2019s like yeast that a woman mixed into a large amount of flour until the yeast worked its way through all the dough.\u201d","Someone asked him
 \u201cSir
 are only a few people going to be saved?\u201d He answered
 ","\u201cTry hard to enter through the narrow door. I can guarantee that many will try to enter
 but they won\u2019t succeed. ","After the homeowner gets up and closes the door
 it\u2019s too late. You can stand outside
 knock at the door
 and say
 \u2018Sir
 open the door for us!\u2019 But he will answer you
 \u2018I don\u2019t know who you are.\u2019 ","Then you will say
 \u2018We ate and drank with you
 and you taught in our streets.\u2019 ","But he will tell you
 \u2018I don\u2019t know who you are. Get away from me
 all you evil people.\u2019 ","Then you will cry and be in extreme pain. That\u2019s what you\u2019ll do when you see Abraham

 \u201cTell that fox that I will force demons out of people and heal people today and tomorrow. I will finish my work on the third day. ","But I must be on my way today
 tomorrow

 \u2018Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord!\u2019\u201d","Yeshua reacted by asking the Pharisees and the experts in Moses\u2019 Teachings
 \u201cIs it right to heal on the day of worship or not?\u201d ","Yeshua asked them
 \u201cIf your son or your ox falls into a well on a day of worship
 wouldn\u2019t you pull him out immediately?\u201d ","\u201cWhen someone invites you to a wedding
 don\u2019t take the place of honor. Maybe someone more important than you was invited. ","Then your host would say to you
 \u2018Give this person your place.\u2019 Embarrassed
 you would have to take the place of least honor. ","So when you\u2019re invited
 take the place of least honor. Then
 when your host comes
 he will tell you
 \u2018Friend
 move to a more honorable place.\u2019 Then all the other guests will see how you are honored. ","Those who honor themselves will be humbled
 but people who humble themselves will be honored.\u201d","Then he told the man who had invited him
 \u201cWhen you invite people for lunch or dinner
 don\u2019t invite only your friends

 they will return the favor. ","Instead
 when you give a banquet
 invite the poor
 the handicapped

 \u201cThe person who will be at the banquet in the kingdom of God is blessed.\u201d","Yeshua said to him
 \u201cA man gave a large banquet and invited many people. ","When it was time for the banquet
 he sent his servant to tell those who were invited
 \u2018Come! Everything is ready now.\u2019","\u201cEveryone asked to be excused. The first said to him
 \u2018I bought a field
 and I need to see it. Please excuse me.\u2019 ","Another said
 \u2018I bought five pairs of oxen
 and I\u2019m on my way to see how well they plow. Please excuse me.\u2019 ","Still another said
 \u2018I recently got married
 and that\u2019s why I can\u2019t come.\u2019","\u201cThe servant went back to report this to his master. Then the master of the house became angry. He told his servant
 \u2018Run to every street and alley in the city! Bring back the poor
 the handicapped

 \u2018Sir
 what you\u2019ve ordered has been done. But there is still room for more people.\u2019","\u201cThen the master told his servant
 \u2018Go to the roads and paths! Urge the people to come to my house. I want it to be full. ","I can guarantee that none of those invited earlier will taste any food at my banquet.\u2019\u201d","Large crowds were traveling with Yeshua. He turned to them and said
 ","\u201cIf people come to me and are not ready to abandon their fathers
 mothers
 wives
 children
 brothers
 and sisters
 as well as their own lives
 they cannot be my disciples. ","So those who do not carry their crosses and follow me cannot be my disciples.","\u201cSuppose you want to build a tower. You would first sit down and figure out what it costs. Then you would see if you have enough money to finish it.","Otherwise
 if you lay a foundation and can\u2019t finish the building
 everyone who watches will make fun of you. ","They\u2019ll say
 \u2018This person started to build but couldn\u2019t finish the job.\u2019","\u201cOr suppose a king is going to war against another king. He would first sit down and think things through. Can he and his 10
000 soldiers fight against a king with 20
000 soldiers? ","If he can\u2019t
 he\u2019ll send ambassadors to ask for terms of peace while the other king is still far away. ","In the same way
 none of you can be my disciples unless you give up everything.","\u201cSalt is good. But if salt loses its taste
 how will you restore its flavor? ","It\u2019s not any good for the ground or for the manure pile. People throw it away. \u201cLet the person who has ears listen!\u201d","\u201cSuppose a man has 100 sheep and loses one of them. Doesn\u2019t he leave the 99 sheep grazing in the pasture and look for the lost sheep until he finds it?","When he finds it
 he\u2019s happy. He puts that sheep on his shoulders and ","goes home. Then he calls his friends and neighbors together and says to them
 \u2018Let\u2019s celebrate!

 \u201cA man had two sons. ","The younger son said to his father
 \u2018Father
 give me my share of the property.\u2019 So the father divided his property between his two sons.","\u201cAfter a few days
 the younger son gathered his possessions and left for a country far away from home. There he wasted everything he had on a wild lifestyle. ","He had nothing left when a severe famine spread throughout that country. He had nothing to live on.","So he got a job from someone in that country and was sent to feed pigs in the fields.","No one in the country would give him any food
 and he was so hungry that he would have eaten what the pigs were eating.","\u201cFinally
 he came to his senses. He said
 \u2018How many of my father\u2019s hired men have more food than they can eat
 while I\u2019m starving to death here? ","I\u2019ll go at once to my father

 his father saw him and felt sorry for him. He ran to his son
 put his arms around him
 and kissed him. ","Then his son said to him
 \u2018Father
 I\u2019ve sinned against heaven and you. I don\u2019t deserve to be called your son anymore.\u2019","\u201cThe father said to his servants
 \u2018Hurry! Bring out the best robe
 and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. ","Bring the fattened calf

 and let\u2019s celebrate with a feast. ","My son was dead and has come back to life. He was lost but has been found.\u2019 Then they began to celebrate.","\u201cHis older son was in the field. As he was coming back to the house
 he heard music and dancing. ","He called to one of the servants and asked what was happening.","\u201cThe servant told him
 \u2018Your brother has come home. So your father has killed the fattened calf to celebrate your brother\u2019s safe return.\u2019","\u201cThen the older son became angry and wouldn\u2019t go into the house. His father came out and begged him to come in.","But he answered his father
 \u2018All these years I\u2019ve worked like a slave for you. I\u2019ve never disobeyed one of your commands. Yet
 you\u2019ve never given me so much as a little goat for a celebration with my friends. ","But this son of yours spent your money on prostitutes

 you killed the fattened calf for him.\u2019","\u201cHis father said to him
 \u2018My child

 something to be happy about. This brother of yours was dead but has come back to life. He was lost but has been found.\u2019\u201d","Then Yeshua said to his disciples
 \u201cA rich man had a business manager. The manager was accused of wasting the rich man\u2019s property. ","So the rich man called for his manager and said to him
 \u2018What\u2019s this I hear about you? Let me examine your books. It\u2019s obvious that you can\u2019t manage my property any longer.\u2019","\u201cThe manager thought
 \u2018What should I do? My master is taking my job away from me. I\u2019m not strong enough to dig
 and I\u2019m ashamed to beg. ","I know what I\u2019ll do so that people will welcome me into their homes when I\u2019ve lost my job.\u2019","\u201cSo the manager called for each one of his master\u2019s debtors. He said to the first
 \u2018How much do you owe my master?\u2019","\u201cThe debtor replied
 \u2018Eight hundred gallons of olive oil.\u2019 \u201cThe manager told him
 \u2018Take my master\u2019s ledger. Quick! Sit down
 and write \u201cfour hundred!\u201d \u2019","\u201cThen he asked another debtor
 \u2018How much do you owe?\u2019 \u201cThe debtor replied
 \u2018A thousand bushels of wheat.\u2019 \u201cThe manager told him
 \u2018Take the ledger
 and write \u201ceight hundred!\u201d \u2019","\u201cThe master praised the dishonest manager for being so clever. Worldly people are more clever than spiritually-minded people when it comes to dealing with others.\u201d","Yeshua continued
 \u201cI\u2019m telling you that although wealth is often used in dishonest ways
 you should use it to make friends for yourselves. When life is over
 you will be welcomed into an eternal home. ","Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with a lot. Whoever is dishonest with very little is dishonest with a lot.","Therefore
 if you can\u2019t be trusted with wealth that is often used dishonestly
 who will trust you with wealth that is real? ","If you can\u2019t be trusted with someone else\u2019s wealth
 who will give you your own?","\u201cA servant cannot serve two masters. He will hate the first master and love the second
 or he will be devoted to the first and despise the second. You cannot serve God and wealth.\u201d","So Yeshua said to them
 \u201cYou try to justify your actions in front of people. But God knows what\u2019s in your hearts. What is important to humans is disgusting to God.","\u201cMoses\u2019 Teachings and the Prophets were in force until the time of John. Since that time
 people have been telling the Good News about the kingdom of God
 and everyone is trying to force their way into it. ","It is easier for the earth and the heavens to disappear than to drop a comma from the Scriptures.","\u201cAny man who divorces his wife to marry another woman is committing adultery. The man who marries a woman divorced in this way is committing adultery.","\u201cThere was a rich man who wore expensive clothes. Every day was like a party to him.","There was also a beggar named Lazarus who was regularly brought to the gate of the rich man\u2019s house.","Lazarus would have eaten any scraps that fell from the rich man\u2019s table. Lazarus was covered with sores
 and dogs would lick them.","\u201cOne day the beggar died
 and the angels carried him to be with Abraham. The rich man also died and was buried. ","He went to hell
 where he was constantly tortured. As he looked up
 in the distance he saw Abraham and Lazarus. ","He yelled
 \u2018Father Abraham! Have mercy on me! Send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water to cool off my tongue. I am suffering in this fire.\u2019","\u201cAbraham replied
 \u2018Remember
 my child
 that you had a life filled with good times
 while Lazarus\u2019 life was filled with misery. Now he has peace here
 while you suffer. ","Besides
 a wide area separates us. People couldn\u2019t cross it in either direction even if they wanted to.\u2019","\u201cThe rich man responded
 \u2018Then I ask you
 Father
 to send Lazarus back to my father\u2019s home. ","I have five brothers. He can warn them so that they won\u2019t end up in this place of torture.\u2019","\u201cAbraham replied
 \u2018They have Moses\u2019 Teachings and the Prophets. Your brothers should listen to them!\u2019","\u201cThe rich man replied
 \u2018No
 Father Abraham! If someone comes back to them from the dead
 they will turn to God and change the way they think and act.\u2019","\u201cAbraham answered him
 \u2018If they won\u2019t listen to Moses\u2019 Teachings and the Prophets
 they won\u2019t be persuaded even if someone comes back to life.\u2019\u201d","Yeshua told his disciples
 \u201cSituations that cause people to lose their faith are certain to arise. But how horrible it will be for the person who causes someone to lose his faith!

 correct him. If he changes the way he thinks and acts
 forgive him. ","Even if he wrongs you seven times in one day and comes back to you seven times and says that he is sorry

 \u2018There he is!\u2019 or \u2018Here he is!\u2019 Don\u2019t run after those people. ","The day of the Son of Man will be like lightning that flashes from one end of the sky to the other.","But first he must suffer a lot and be rejected by the people of his day.","\u201cWhen the Son of Man comes again
 the situation will be like the time of Noah. ","People were eating
 drinking
 and getting married until the day that Noah went into the ship. Then the flood destroyed all of them.","\u201cThe situation will also be like the time of Lot. People were eating
 drinking
 buying and selling
 planting and building. ","But on the day that Lot left Sodom
 fire and sulfur rained from the sky and destroyed all of them. ","The day when the Son of Man is revealed will be like that.","\u201cOn that day those who are on the roof shouldn\u2019t come down to get their belongings out of their houses. Those who are in the field shouldn\u2019t turn back.","Remember Lot\u2019s wife!","Those who try to save their lives will lose them
 and those who lose their lives will save them.","\u201cI can guarantee that on that night if two people are in one bed
 one will be taken and the other one will be left. ","Two women will be grinding grain together. One will be taken
 and the other one will be left.\u201d","They asked him
 \u201cWhere
 Lord?\u201d Yeshua told them
 \u201cVultures will gather wherever there is a dead body.\u201d","He said
 \u201cIn a city there was a judge who didn\u2019t fear God or respect people. ","In that city there was also a widow who kept coming to him and saying
 \u2018Give me justice.\u2019","\u201cFor a while the judge refused to do anything. But then he thought
 \u2018This widow really annoys me. Although I don\u2019t fear God or respect people
 ","I\u2019ll have to give her justice. Otherwise
 she\u2019ll keep coming to me until she wears me out.\u2019\u201d","The Lord added
 \u201cPay attention to what the dishonest judge thought. ","Won\u2019t God give his chosen people justice when they cry out to him for help day and night? Is he slow to help them?","I can guarantee that he will give them justice quickly. But when the Son of Man comes
 will he find faith on earth?\u201d","He said
 \u201cTwo men went into the temple courtyard to pray. One was a Pharisee
 and the other was a tax collector. ","The Pharisee stood up and prayed
 \u2018God
 I thank you that I\u2019m not like other people! I\u2019m not a robber or a dishonest person. I haven\u2019t committed adultery. I\u2019m not even like this tax collector. ","I fast twice a week
 and I give you a tenth of my entire income.\u2019","\u201cBut the tax collector was standing at a distance. He wouldn\u2019t even look up to heaven. Instead
 he became very upset
 and he said
 \u2018God
 be merciful to me
 a sinner!\u2019","\u201cI can guarantee that this tax collector went home with God\u2019s approval
 but the Pharisee didn\u2019t. Everyone who honors himself will be humbled
 but the person who humbles himself will be honored.\u201d","But Yeshua called the infants to him and said
 \u201cDon\u2019t stop the children from coming to me! Children like these are part of the kingdom of God. ","I can guarantee this truth: Whoever doesn\u2019t receive the kingdom of God as a little child receives it will never enter it.\u201d","Yeshua said to him
 \u201cWhy do you call me good? No one is good except God. ","You know the commandments: Never commit adultery. Never murder. Never steal. Never give false testimony. Honor your father and your mother.\u201d","The official replied
 \u201cI\u2019ve obeyed all these commandments since I was a boy.\u201d","When Yeshua heard this
 he said to him
 \u201cYou still need one thing. Sell everything you have. Distribute the money to the poor
 and you will have treasure in heaven. Then follow me!\u201d","Yeshua watched him and said
 \u201cHow hard it is for rich people to enter the kingdom of God! ","Indeed
 it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.\u201d","Yeshua said
 \u201cThe things that are impossible for people to do are possible for God to do.\u201d","Yeshua said to them
 \u201cI can guarantee this truth: Anyone who gave up his home
 wife
 brothers
 parents
 or children because of the kingdom of God ","will certainly receive many times as much in this life and will receive eternal life in the world to come.\u201d","Yeshua took the twelve apostles aside and said to them
 \u201cWe\u2019re going to Jerusalem. Everything that the prophets wrote about the Son of Man will come true. ","He will be handed over to foreigners. They will make fun of him
 insult him
 spit on him
 ","whip him
 and kill him. But on the third day he will come back to life.\u201d","But they didn\u2019t understand any of this. What he said was a mystery to them

 \u201cLord
 I want to see again.\u201d","Yeshua told him
 \u201cReceive your sight! Your faith has made you well.\u201d ","When Yeshua came to the tree
 he looked up and said
 \u201cZacchaeus

 at dinner
 Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord

 \u201cYou and your family have been saved today. You\u2019ve shown that you

 \u2018Sir

 \u201cIf you had only known today what would bring you peace! But now it is hidden

 \u2018My house will be a house of prayer

 have a question for you. Tell me
 ","did John\u2019s right to baptize come from heaven or from humans?\u201d","Yeshua told them
 \u201cThen I won\u2019t tell you why I have the right to do these things.\u201d","Then
 using this illustration
 Yeshua spoke to the people: \u201cA man planted a vineyard
 leased it to vineyard workers
 and went on a long trip.","\u201cAt the right time he sent a servant to the workers to obtain from them a share of the grapes from the vineyard. But the workers beat the servant and sent him back with nothing.","So he sent a different servant. The workers beat him
 treated him shamefully
 and sent him back with nothing. ","Then he sent a third servant. But they injured this one and threw him out of the vineyard.","\u201cThen the owner of the vineyard said
 \u2018What should I do? I\u2019ll send my son
 whom I love. They\u2019ll probably respect him.\u2019","\u201cWhen the workers saw him
 they talked it over among themselves. They said
 \u2018This is the heir. Let\u2019s kill him so that the inheritance will be ours.\u2019 ","So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. \u201cWhat will the owner of the vineyard do to them?","He will destroy these workers and give the vineyard to others.\u201d Those who heard him said
 \u201cThat\u2019s unthinkable!\u201d","Then Yeshua looked straight at them and asked
 \u201cWhat
 then
 does this Scripture verse mean: \u2018The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone\u2019?","Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken. If that stone falls on anyone
 it will crush that person.\u201d","So they watched for an opportunity to send out some spies. The spies were to act like sincere religious people.

 so they said no more.","Yeshua said to them
 \u201cIn this world people get married. ","But people who are considered worthy to come back to life and live in the next world will neither marry","nor die anymore. They are the same as the angels. They are God\u2019s children who have come back to life.","\u201cEven Moses showed in the passage about the bush that the dead come back to life. He says that the Lord is the God of Abraham

 \u201cI can guarantee this truth: This poor widow has given more than all the others. ","All of these people have given what they could spare. But she
 in her poverty
 has given everything she had to live on.\u201d","\u201cAbout these buildings that you see\u2014the time will come when not one of these stones will be left on top of another. Each one will be torn down.\u201d","Yeshua said

 don\u2019t be terrified! These things must happen first

 \u201cNation will fight against nation and kingdom against kingdom. ","There will be terrible earthquakes
 famines

 people will arrest and persecute you. They will hand you over to their synagogues and put you into their prisons. They will drag you in front of kings and governors because of my name.

 the land will suffer very hard times

 moon

 stand with confidence! The time when you will be set free is near.\u201d","Then Yeshua used this story as an illustration. \u201cLook at the fig tree or any other tree.","As soon as leaves grow on them
 you know without being told that summer is near. ","In the same way
 when you see these things happen
 you know that the kingdom of God is near.","\u201cI can guarantee this truth: This generation will not disappear until all this takes place.","The earth and the heavens will disappear

 \u201cTake this

 \u2018You are the Son of God!\u2019 But he rebuked them and would not allow them to speak
 because they knew that he was the Messiah.","But he said to them
 \u2018I must proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God to the other cities also; for I was sent for this purpose.\u2019 ","When he had finished speaking
 he said to Simon
 \u2018Put out into the deep water and let down your nets for a catch.\u2019 ","and so also were James and John
 sons of Zebedee
 who were partners with Simon. Then Jesus said to Simon
 \u2018Do not be afraid; from now on you will be catching people.\u2019 ","Then Jesus stretched out his hand
 touched him
 and said
 \u2018I do choose. Be made clean.\u2019 Immediately the leprosy left him. ","And he ordered him to tell no one. \u2018Go\u2019
 he said
 \u2018and show yourself to the priest
 and
 as Moses commanded
 make an offering for your cleansing
 for a testimony to them.\u2019 ","When he saw their faith
 he said
 \u2018Friend
 your sins are forgiven you.\u2019 ","When Jesus perceived their questionings
 he answered them
 \u2018Why do you raise such questions in your hearts? ","Which is easier
 to say
 \u201cYour sins are forgiven you\u201d
 or to say
 \u201cStand up and walk\u201d? ","But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins\u2019\u2014he said to the one who was paralysed\u2014\u2018I say to you
 stand up and take your bed and go to your home.\u2019 ","After this he went out and saw a tax-collector named Levi
 sitting at the tax booth; and he said to him
 \u2018Follow me.\u2019 ","Jesus answered
 \u2018Those who are well have no need of a physician
 but those who are sick; ","I have come to call not the righteous but sinners to repentance.\u2019","Then they said to him
 \u2018John\u2019s disciples
 like the disciples of the Pharisees
 frequently fast and pray
 but your disciples eat and drink.\u2019 ","Jesus said to them
 \u2018You cannot make wedding-guests fast while the bridegroom is with them
 can you? ","The days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them
 and then they will fast in those days.\u2019 ","He also told them a parable: \u2018No one tears a piece from a new garment and sews it on an old garment; otherwise the new will be torn
 and the piece from the new will not match the old. ","And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; otherwise the new wine will burst the skins and will be spilled
 and the skins will be destroyed. ","But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins.","And no one after drinking old wine desires new wine
 but says
 \u201cThe old is good.\u201d\u2019","Jesus answered
 \u2018Have you not read what David did when he and his companions were hungry? ","He entered the house of God and took and ate the bread of the Presence
 which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat
 and gave some to his companions?\u2019 ","Then he said to them
 \u2018The Son of Man is lord of the sabbath.\u2019","Even though he knew what they were thinking
 he said to the man who had the withered hand
 \u2018Come and stand here.\u2019 He got up and stood there. ","Then Jesus said to them
 \u2018I ask you
 is it lawful to do good or to do harm on the sabbath
 to save life or to destroy it?\u2019 ","After looking around at all of them
 he said to him
 \u2018Stretch out your hand.\u2019 He did so
 and his hand was restored. ","\u2018Blessed are you who are hungry now
 for you will be filled. \u2018Blessed are you who weep now
 for you will laugh.","\u2018Blessed are you when people hate you
 and when they exclude you
 revile you
 and defame you on account of the Son of Man. ","Rejoice on that day and leap for joy
 for surely your reward is great in heaven; for that is what their ancestors did to the prophets.","\u2018But woe to you who are rich
 for you have received your consolation.","\u2018Woe to you who are full now
 for you will be hungry. \u2018Woe to you who are laughing now
 for you will mourn and weep.","\u2018Woe to you when all speak well of you
 for that is what their ancestors did to the false prophets.","\u2018But I say to you that listen
 Love your enemies
 do good to those who hate you
 ","bless those who curse you
 pray for those who abuse you. ","If anyone strikes you on the cheek
 offer the other also; and from anyone who takes away your coat do not withhold even your shirt. ","Give to everyone who begs from you; and if anyone takes away your goods
 do not ask for them again. ","Do to others as you would have them do to you.","\u2018If you love those who love you
 what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them. ","If you do good to those who do good to you
 what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same. ","If you lend to those from whom you hope to receive
 what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners
 to receive as much again. ","But love your enemies
 do good
 and lend
 expecting nothing in return. Your reward will be great
 and you will be children of the Most High; for he is kind to the ungrateful and the wicked. ","Be merciful
 just as your Father is merciful.","\u2018Do not judge
 and you will not be judged; do not condemn
 and you will not be condemned. Forgive
 and you will be forgiven; ","give
 and it will be given to you. A good measure
 pressed down
 shaken together
 running over
 will be put into your lap; for the measure you give will be the measure you get back.\u2019","He also told them a parable: \u2018Can a blind person guide a blind person? Will not both fall into a pit?","A disciple is not above the teacher
 but everyone who is fully qualified will be like the teacher. ","Why do you see the speck in your neighbour\u2019s eye
 but do not notice the log in your own eye? ","Or how can you say to your neighbour
 \u201cFriend
 let me take out the speck in your eye\u201d
 when you yourself do not see the log in your own eye? You hypocrite
 first take the log out of your own eye
 and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your neighbour\u2019s eye.","\u2018No good tree bears bad fruit
 nor again does a bad tree bear good fruit; ","for each tree is known by its own fruit. Figs are not gathered from thorns
 nor are grapes picked from a bramble bush. ","The good person out of the good treasure of the heart produces good
 and the evil person out of evil treasure produces evil; for it is out of the abundance of the heart that the mouth speaks.","\u2018Why do you call me \u201cLord
 Lord\u201d
 and do not do what I tell you? ","I will show you what someone is like who comes to me
 hears my words
 and acts on them. ","That one is like a man building a house
 who dug deeply and laid the foundation on rock; when a flood arose
 the river burst against that house but could not shake it
 because it had been well built. ","But the one who hears and does not act is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation. When the river burst against it
 immediately it fell
 and great was the ruin of that house.\u2019","When Jesus heard this he was amazed at him
 and turning to the crowd that followed him
 he said
 \u2018I tell you
 not even in Israel have I found such faith.\u2019 ","When the Lord saw her
 he had compassion for her and said to her
 \u2018Do not weep.\u2019 ","Then he came forward and touched the bier
 and the bearers stood still. And he said
 \u2018Young man
 I say to you
 rise!\u2019 ","And he answered them
 \u2018Go and tell John what you have seen and heard: the blind receive their sight
 the lame walk
 the lepers are cleansed
 the deaf hear
 the dead are raised
 the poor have good news brought to them. ","And blessed is anyone who takes no offence at me.\u2019","When John\u2019s messengers had gone
 Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: \u2018What did you go out into the wilderness to look at? A reed shaken by the wind? ","What then did you go out to see? Someone dressed in soft robes? Look
 those who put on fine clothing and live in luxury are in royal palaces. ","What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes
 I tell you
 and more than a prophet. ","This is the one about whom it is written
 \u201cSee
 I am sending my messenger ahead of you
 who will prepare your way before you.\u201d","I tell you
 among those born of women no one is greater than John; yet the least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.\u2019 ","\u2018To what then will I compare the people of this generation
 and what are they like? ","They are like children sitting in the market-place and calling to one another
 \u201cWe played the flute for you

 and you did not weep.\u201d","For John the Baptist has come eating no bread and drinking no wine
 and you say
 \u201cHe has a demon\u201d; ","the Son of Man has come eating and drinking
 and you say
 \u201cLook
 a glutton and a drunkard
 a friend of tax-collectors and sinners!\u201d ","Nevertheless
 wisdom is vindicated by all her children.\u2019","Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw it
 he said to himself
 \u2018If this man were a prophet
 he would have known who and what kind of woman this is who is touching him\u2014that she is a sinner.\u2019 ","Jesus spoke up and said to him
 \u2018Simon
 I have something to say to you.\u2019 \u2018Teacher
\u2019 he replied
 \u2018speak.\u2019 ","\u2018A certain creditor had two debtors; one owed five hundred denarii
 and the other fifty. ","When they could not pay
 he cancelled the debts for both of them. Now which of them will love him more?\u2019 ","Simon answered
 \u2018I suppose the one for whom he cancelled the greater debt.\u2019 And Jesus said to him
 \u2018You have judged rightly.\u2019 ","Then turning towards the woman
 he said to Simon
 \u2018Do you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave me no water for my feet
 but she has bathed my feet with her tears and dried them with her hair. ","You gave me no kiss
 but from the time I came in she has not stopped kissing my feet. ","You did not anoint my head with oil
 but she has anointed my feet with ointment. ","Therefore
 I tell you
 her sins
 which were many
 have been forgiven; hence she has shown great love. But the one to whom little is forgiven
 loves little.\u2019 ","Then he said to her
 \u2018Your sins are forgiven.\u2019 ","And he said to the woman
 \u2018Your faith has saved you; go in peace.\u2019","When a great crowd gathered and people from town after town came to him
 he said in a parable: ","\u2018A sower went out to sow his seed; and as he sowed
 some fell on the path and was trampled on
 and the birds of the air ate it up. ","Some fell on the rock; and as it grew up
 it withered for lack of moisture. ","Some fell among thorns
 and the thorns grew with it and choked it. ","Some fell into good soil
 and when it grew
 it produced a hundredfold.\u2019 As he said this
 he called out
 \u2018Let anyone with ears to hear listen!\u2019","He said
 \u2018To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of God; but to others I speak in parables
 so that \u201clooking they may not perceive
 and listening they may not understand.\u201d","\u2018Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.","The ones on the path are those who have heard; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts
 so that they may not believe and be saved. ","The ones on the rock are those who
 when they hear the word
 receive it with joy. But these have no root; they believe only for a while and in a time of testing fall away. ","As for what fell among the thorns
 these are the ones who hear; but as they go on their way
 they are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life
 and their fruit does not mature. ","But as for that in the good soil
 these are the ones who
 when they hear the word
 hold it fast in an honest and good heart
 and bear fruit with patient endurance.","\u2018No one after lighting a lamp hides it under a jar
 or puts it under a bed
 but puts it on a lampstand
 so that those who enter may see the light. ","For nothing is hidden that will not be disclosed
 nor is anything secret that will not become known and come to light. ","Then pay attention to how you listen; for to those who have
 more will be given; and from those who do not have
 even what they seem to have will be taken away.\u2019","And he was told
 \u2018Your mother and your brothers are standing outside
 wanting to see you.\u2019 ","But he said to them
 \u2018My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God and do it.\u2019","One day he got into a boat with his disciples
 and he said to them
 \u2018Let us go across to the other side of the lake.\u2019 So they put out
 ","He said to them
 \u2018Where is your faith?\u2019 They were afraid and amazed
 and said to one another
 \u2018Who then is this
 that he commands even the winds and the water
 and they obey him?\u2019","Jesus then asked him
 \u2018What is your name?\u2019 He said
 \u2018Legion\u2019; for many demons had entered him. ","\u2018Return to your home
 and declare how much God has done for you.\u2019 So he went away
 proclaiming throughout the city how much Jesus had done for him.","Then Jesus asked
 \u2018Who touched me?\u2019 When all denied it
 Peter said
 \u2018Master
 the crowds surround you and press in on you.\u2019 ","But Jesus said
 \u2018Someone touched me; for I noticed that power had gone out from me.\u2019 ","He said to her
 \u2018Daughter
 your faith has made you well; go in peace.\u2019","When Jesus heard this
 he replied
 \u2018Do not fear. Only believe
 and she will be saved.\u2019 ","They were all weeping and wailing for her; but he said
 \u2018Do not weep; for she is not dead but sleeping.\u2019 ","But he took her by the hand and called out
 \u2018Child
 get up!\u2019 ","He said to them
 \u2018Take nothing for your journey
 no staff
 nor bag
 nor bread
 nor money\u2014not even an extra tunic. ","Whatever house you enter
 stay there
 and leave from there. ","Wherever they do not welcome you
 as you are leaving that town shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them.\u2019 ","But he said to them
 \u2018You give them something to eat.\u2019 They said
 \u2018We have no more than five loaves and two fish\u2014unless we are to go and buy food for all these people.\u2019 ","For there were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples
 \u2018Make them sit down in groups of about fifty each.\u2019 ","Once when Jesus was praying alone
 with only the disciples near him
 he asked them
 \u2018Who do the crowds say that I am?\u2019 ","He said to them
 \u2018But who do you say that I am?\u2019 Peter answered
 \u2018The Messiah of God.\u2019","saying
 \u2018The Son of Man must undergo great suffering
 and be rejected by the elders
 chief priests
 and scribes
 and be killed
 and on the third day be raised.\u2019","Then he said to them all
 \u2018If any want to become my followers
 let them deny themselves and take up their cross daily and follow me. ","For those who want to save their life will lose it
 and those who lose their life for my sake will save it. ","What does it profit them if they gain the whole world
 but lose or forfeit themselves? ","Those who are ashamed of me and of my words
 of them the Son of Man will be ashamed when he comes in his glory and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels. ","But truly I tell you
 there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God.\u2019","Just as they were leaving him
 Peter said to Jesus
 \u2018Master
 it is good for us to be here; let us make three dwellings
 one for you
 one for Moses
 and one for Elijah\u2019\u2014not knowing what he said. ","Jesus answered
 \u2018You faithless and perverse generation
 how much longer must I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here.\u2019 ","\u2018Let these words sink into your ears: The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into human hands.\u2019","and said to them
 \u2018Whoever welcomes this child in my name welcomes me
 and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me; for the least among all of you is the greatest.\u2019","But Jesus said to him
 \u2018Do not stop him; for whoever is not against you is for you.\u2019","And Jesus said to him
 \u2018Foxes have holes
 and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.\u2019 ","To another he said
 \u2018Follow me.\u2019 But he said
 \u2018Lord
 first let me go and bury my father.\u2019 ","But Jesus said to him
 \u2018Let the dead bury their own dead; but as for you
 go and proclaim the kingdom of God.\u2019 ","Jesus said to him
 \u2018No one who puts a hand to the plough and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God.\u2019","He said to them
 \u2018The harvest is plentiful
 but the labourers are few; therefore ask the Lord of the harvest to send out labourers into his harvest. ","Go on your way. See
 I am sending you out like lambs into the midst of wolves. ","Carry no purse
 no bag
 no sandals; and greet no one on the road. ","Whatever house you enter
 first say
 \u201cPeace to this house!\u201d ","And if anyone is there who shares in peace
 your peace will rest on that person; but if not
 it will return to you. ","Remain in the same house
 eating and drinking whatever they provide
 for the labourer deserves to be paid. Do not move about from house to house. ","Whenever you enter a town and its people welcome you
 eat what is set before you; ","cure the sick who are there
 and say to them
 \u201cThe kingdom of God has come near to you.\u201d ","But whenever you enter a town and they do not welcome you
 go out into its streets and say
 ","\u201cEven the dust of your town that clings to our feet
 we wipe off in protest against you. Yet know this: the kingdom of God has come near.\u201d ","I tell you
 on that day it will be more tolerable for Sodom than for that town.","\u2018Woe to you
 Chorazin! Woe to you
 Bethsaida! For if the deeds of power done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon
 they would have repented long ago
 sitting in sackcloth and ashes. ","But at the judgement it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon than for you.","And you
 Capernaum
 will you be exalted to heaven? No
 you will be brought down to Hades.","\u2018Whoever listens to you listens to me
 and whoever rejects you rejects me
 and whoever rejects me rejects the one who sent me.\u2019","He said to them
 \u2018I watched Satan fall from heaven like a flash of lightning. ","See
 I have given you authority to tread on snakes and scorpions
 and over all the power of the enemy; and nothing will hurt you. ","Nevertheless
 do not rejoice at this
 that the spirits submit to you
 but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.\u2019","At that same hour Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said
 \u2018I thank you
 Father
 Lord of heaven and earth
 because you have hidden these things from the wise and the intelligent and have revealed them to infants; yes
 Father
 for such was your gracious will. ","All things have been handed over to me by my Father; and no one knows who the Son is except the Father
 or who the Father is except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.\u2019","Then turning to the disciples
 Jesus said to them privately
 \u2018Blessed are the eyes that see what you see! ","For I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see what you see
 but did not see it
 and to hear what you hear
 but did not hear it.\u2019","Just then a lawyer stood up to test Jesus. \u2018Teacher
\u2019 he said
 \u2018what must I do to inherit eternal life?\u2019 ","He said to him
 \u2018What is written in the law? What do you read there?\u2019 ","And he said to him
 \u2018You have given the right answer; do this
 and you will live.\u2019","Jesus replied
 \u2018A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho
 and fell into the hands of robbers
 who stripped him
 beat him
 and went away
 leaving him half dead. ","Now by chance a priest was going down that road; and when he saw him
 he passed by on the other side. ","So likewise a Levite
 when he came to the place and saw him
 passed by on the other side. ","But a Samaritan while travelling came near him; and when he saw him
 he was moved with pity. ","He went to him and bandaged his wounds
 having poured oil and wine on them. Then he put him on his own animal
 brought him to an inn
 and took care of him. ","The next day he took out two denarii
 gave them to the innkeeper
 and said
 \u201cTake care of him; and when I come back
 I will repay you whatever more you spend.\u201d ","Which of these three
 do you think
 was a neighbour to the man who fell into the hands of the robbers?\u2019 ","He said
 \u2018The one who showed him mercy.\u2019 Jesus said to him
 \u2018Go and do likewise.\u2019","But the Lord answered her
 \u2018Martha
 Martha
 you are worried and distracted by many things; ","there is need of only one thing. Mary has chosen the better part
 which will not be taken away from her.\u2019","He was praying in a certain place
 and after he had finished
 one of his disciples said to him
 \u2018Lord
 teach us to pray
 as John taught his disciples.\u2019 ","He said to them
 \u2018When you pray
 say: Father
 hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come.","Give us each day our daily bread.","    And forgive us our sins
 for we ourselves forgive everyone indebted to us. And do not bring us to the time of trial.\u2019","And he said to them
 \u2018Suppose one of you has a friend
 and you go to him at midnight and say to him
 \u201cFriend
 lend me three loaves of bread; ","for a friend of mine has arrived
 and I have nothing to set before him.\u201d ","And he answers from within
 \u201cDo not bother me; the door has already been locked
 and my children are with me in bed; I cannot get up and give you anything.\u201d ","I tell you
 even though he will not get up and give him anything because he is his friend
 at least because of his persistence he will get up and give him whatever he needs.","\u2018So I say to you
 Ask
 and it will be given to you; search
 and you will find; knock
 and the door will be opened for you. ","For everyone who asks receives
 and everyone who searches finds
 and for everyone who knocks
 the door will be opened. ","Is there anyone among you who
 if your child asks for a fish
 will give a snake instead of a fish? ","Or if the child asks for an egg
 will give a scorpion? ","If you then
 who are evil
 know how to give good gifts to your children
 how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!\u2019","Now he was casting out a demon that was mute; when the demon had gone out
 the one who had been mute spoke
 and the crowds were amazed. ","But he knew what they were thinking and said to them
 \u2018Every kingdom divided against itself becomes a desert
 and house falls on house. ","If Satan also is divided against himself
 how will his kingdom stand? \u2014for you say that I cast out the demons by Beelzebul. ","Now if I cast out the demons by Beelzebul
 by whom do your exorcists cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges. ","But if it is by the finger of God that I cast out the demons
 then the kingdom of God has come to you. ","When a strong man
 fully armed
 guards his castle
 his property is safe. ","But when one stronger than he attacks him and overpowers him
 he takes away his armour in which he trusted and divides his plunder. ","Whoever is not with me is against me
 and whoever does not gather with me scatters.","\u2018When the unclean spirit has gone out of a person
 it wanders through waterless regions looking for a resting-place
 but not finding any
 it says
 \u201cI will return to my house from which I came.\u201d ","When it comes
 it finds it swept and put in order. ","Then it goes and brings seven other spirits more evil than itself
 and they enter and live there; and the last state of that person is worse than the first.\u2019","While he was saying this
 a woman in the crowd raised her voice and said to him
 \u2018Blessed is the womb that bore you and the breasts that nursed you!\u2019 ","But he said
 \u2018Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and obey it!\u2019","When the crowds were increasing
 he began to say
 \u2018This generation is an evil generation; it asks for a sign
 but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah. ","For just as Jonah became a sign to the people of Nineveh
 so the Son of Man will be to this generation. ","The queen of the South will rise at the judgement with the people of this generation and condemn them
 because she came from the ends of the earth to listen to the wisdom of Solomon
 and see
 something greater than Solomon is here! ","The people of Nineveh will rise up at the judgement with this generation and condemn it
 because they repented at the proclamation of Jonah
 and see
 something greater than Jonah is here!","\u2018No one after lighting a lamp puts it in a cellar
 but on the lampstand so that those who enter may see the light. ","Your eye is the lamp of your body. If your eye is healthy
 your whole body is full of light; but if it is not healthy
 your body is full of darkness. ","Therefore consider whether the light in you is not darkness.","If then your whole body is full of light
 with no part of it in darkness
 it will be as full of light as when a lamp gives you light with its rays.\u2019","Then the Lord said to him
 \u2018Now you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and of the dish
 but inside you are full of greed and wickedness. ","You fools! Did not the one who made the outside make the inside also?","So give for alms those things that are within; and see
 everything will be clean for you.","\u2018But woe to you Pharisees! For you tithe mint and rue and herbs of all kinds
 and neglect justice and the love of God; it is these you ought to have practised
 without neglecting the others. ","Woe to you Pharisees! For you love to have the seat of honour in the synagogues and to be greeted with respect in the market-places.","Woe to you! For you are like unmarked graves
 and people walk over them without realizing it.\u2019","And he said
 \u2018Woe also to you lawyers! For you load people with burdens hard to bear
 and you yourselves do not lift a finger to ease them. ","Woe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets whom your ancestors killed.","So you are witnesses and approve of the deeds of your ancestors; for they killed them
 and you build their tombs. ","Therefore also the Wisdom of God said
 \u201cI will send them prophets and apostles

 ","so that this generation may be charged with the blood of all the prophets shed since the foundation of the world
 ","from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah

 I tell you

 when the crowd gathered in thousands
 so that they trampled on one another
 he began to speak first to his disciples
 \u2018Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees

 their hypocrisy. ","Nothing is covered up that will not be uncovered

 do not fear those who kill the body

 fear him! ","Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? Yet not one of them is forgotten in God\u2019s sight.","But even the hairs of your head are all counted. Do not be afraid; you are of more value than many sparrows.","\u2018And I tell you
 everyone who acknowledges me before others
 the Son of Man also will acknowledge before the angels of God; ","but whoever denies me before others will be denied before the angels of God.","And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven; but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.","When they bring you before the synagogues
 the rulers
 and the authorities
 do not worry about how you are to defend yourselves or what you are to say; ","for the Holy Spirit will teach you at that very hour what you ought to say.\u2019","But he said to him
 \u2018Friend
 who set me to be a judge or arbitrator over you?\u2019 ","And he said to them
 \u2018Take care! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; for one\u2019s life does not consist in the abundance of possessions.\u2019 ","Then he told them a parable: \u2018The land of a rich man produced abundantly.","And he thought to himself
 \u201cWhat should I do
 for I have no place to store my crops?\u201d ","Then he said
 \u201cI will do this: I will pull down my barns and build larger ones
 and there I will store all my grain and my goods. ","And I will say to my soul
 Soul
 you have ample goods laid up for many years; relax
 eat
 drink
 be merry.\u201d ","But God said to him
 \u201cYou fool! This very night your life is being demanded of you. And the things you have prepared
 whose will they be?\u201d ","So it is with those who store up treasures for themselves but are not rich towards God.\u2019","He said to his disciples
 \u2018Therefore I tell you
 do not worry about your life
 what you will eat
 or about your body
 what you will wear. ","For life is more than food
 and the body more than clothing. ","Consider the ravens: they neither sow nor reap
 they have neither storehouse nor barn
 and yet God feeds them. Of how much more value are you than the birds! ","And can any of you by worrying add a single hour to your span of life?","If then you are not able to do so small a thing as that
 why do you worry about the rest? ","Consider the lilies
 how they grow: they neither toil nor spin; yet I tell you
 even Solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these. ","But if God so clothes the grass of the field
 which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven
 how much more will he clothe you\u2014you of little faith! ","And do not keep striving for what you are to eat and what you are to drink
 and do not keep worrying. ","For it is the nations of the world that strive after all these things
 and your Father knows that you need them. ","Instead
 strive for his kingdom
 and these things will be given to you as well.","\u2018Do not be afraid
 little flock
 for it is your Father\u2019s good pleasure to give you the kingdom. ","Sell your possessions
 and give alms. Make purses for yourselves that do not wear out
 an unfailing treasure in heaven
 where no thief comes near and no moth destroys. ","For where your treasure is
 there your heart will be also.","\u2018Be dressed for action and have your lamps lit;","be like those who are waiting for their master to return from the wedding banquet
 so that they may open the door for him as soon as he comes and knocks. ","Blessed are those slaves whom the master finds alert when he comes; truly I tell you
 he will fasten his belt and have them sit down to eat
 and he will come and serve them. ","If he comes during the middle of the night
 or near dawn
 and finds them so
 blessed are those slaves.","\u2018But know this: if the owner of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming
 he would not have let his house be broken into. ","You also must be ready
 for the Son of Man is coming at an unexpected hour.\u2019","And the Lord said
 \u2018Who then is the faithful and prudent manager whom his master will put in charge of his slaves
 to give them their allowance of food at the proper time? ","Blessed is that slave whom his master will find at work when he arrives.","Truly I tell you
 he will put that one in charge of all his possessions. ","But if that slave says to himself
 \u201cMy master is delayed in coming\u201d
 and if he begins to beat the other slaves
 men and women
 and to eat and drink and get drunk
 ","the master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour that he does not know
 and will cut him in pieces
 and put him with the unfaithful. ","That slave who knew what his master wanted
 but did not prepare himself or do what was wanted
 will receive a severe beating. ","But one who did not know and did what deserved a beating will receive a light beating. From everyone to whom much has been given
 much will be required; and from one to whom much has been entrusted
 even more will be demanded.","\u2018I came to bring fire to the earth
 and how I wish it were already kindled! ","I have a baptism with which to be baptized
 and what stress I am under until it is completed! ","Do you think that I have come to bring peace to the earth? No
 I tell you
 but rather division! ","From now on
 five in one household will be divided
 three against two and two against three; ","they will be divided: father against son and son against father
 mother against daughter and daughter against mother
 mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.\u2019","He also said to the crowds
 \u2018When you see a cloud rising in the west
 you immediately say
 \u201cIt is going to rain\u201d; and so it happens. ","And when you see the south wind blowing
 you say
 \u201cThere will be scorching heat\u201d; and it happens. ","You hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of earth and sky
 but why do you not know how to interpret the present time?","\u2018And why do you not judge for yourselves what is right?","Thus
 when you go with your accuser before a magistrate
 on the way make an effort to settle the case
 or you may be dragged before the judge
 and the judge hand you over to the officer
 and the officer throw you in prison. ","I tell you
 you will never get out until you have paid the very last penny.\u2019","He asked them
 \u2018Do you think that because these Galileans suffered in this way they were worse sinners than all other Galileans? ","No
 I tell you; but unless you repent
 you will all perish as they did. ","Or those eighteen who were killed when the tower of Siloam fell on them\u2014do you think that they were worse offenders than all the others living in Jerusalem?","No
 I tell you; but unless you repent
 you will all perish just as they did.\u2019","Then he told this parable: \u2018A man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came looking for fruit on it and found none.","So he said to the gardener
 \u201cSee here! For three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree
 and still I find none. Cut it down! Why should it be wasting the soil?\u201d ","He replied
 \u201cSir
 let it alone for one more year
 until I dig round it and put manure on it. ","If it bears fruit next year
 well and good; but if not
 you can cut it down.\u201d\u2019","When Jesus saw her
 he called her over and said
 \u2018Woman
 you are set free from your ailment.\u2019 ","But the Lord answered him and said
 \u2018You hypocrites! Does not each of you on the sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from the manger
 and lead it away to give it water? ","And ought not this woman
 a daughter of Abraham whom Satan bound for eighteen long years
 be set free from this bondage on the sabbath day?\u2019 ","He said therefore
 \u2018What is the kingdom of God like? And to what should I compare it? ","It is like a mustard seed that someone took and sowed in the garden; it grew and became a tree
 and the birds of the air made nests in its branches.\u2019","And again he said
 \u2018To what should I compare the kingdom of God? ","It is like yeast that a woman took and mixed in with three measures of flour until all of it was leavened.\u2019","Someone asked him
 \u2018Lord
 will only a few be saved?\u2019 He said to them
 ","\u2018Strive to enter through the narrow door; for many
 I tell you
 will try to enter and will not be able. ","When once the owner of the house has got up and shut the door
 and you begin to stand outside and to knock at the door
 saying
 \u201cLord
 open to us\u201d
 then in reply he will say to you
 \u201cI do not know where you come from.\u201d ","Then you will begin to say
 \u201cWe ate and drank with you
 and you taught in our streets.\u201d ","But he will say
 \u201cI do not know where you come from; go away from me
 all you evildoers!\u201d ","There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God
 and you yourselves thrown out. ","Then people will come from east and west
 from north and south
 and will eat in the kingdom of God. ","Indeed
 some are last who will be first
 and some are first who will be last.\u2019","He said to them
 \u2018Go and tell that fox for me
 \u201cListen
 I am casting out demons and performing cures today and tomorrow
 and on the third day I finish my work. ","Yet today
 tomorrow
 and the next day I must be on my way
 because it is impossible for a prophet to be killed away from Jerusalem.\u201d ","Jerusalem
 Jerusalem
 the city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it! How often have I desired to gather your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings
 and you were not willing! ","See
 your house is left to you. And I tell you
 you will not see me until the time comes when you say
 \u201cBlessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord.\u201d\u2019","And Jesus asked the lawyers and Pharisees
 \u2018Is it lawful to cure people on the sabbath
 or not?\u2019 ","Then he said to them
 \u2018If one of you has a child or an ox that has fallen into a well
 will you not immediately pull it out on a sabbath day?\u2019 ","\u2018When you are invited by someone to a wedding banquet
 do not sit down at the place of honour
 in case someone more distinguished than you has been invited by your host; ","and the host who invited both of you may come and say to you
 \u201cGive this person your place\u201d
 and then in disgrace you would start to take the lowest place. ","But when you are invited
 go and sit down at the lowest place
 so that when your host comes
 he may say to you
 \u201cFriend
 move up higher\u201d; then you will be honoured in the presence of all who sit at the table with you. ","For all who exalt themselves will be humbled
 and those who humble themselves will be exalted.\u2019","He said also to the one who had invited him
 \u2018When you give a luncheon or a dinner
 do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbours
 in case they may invite you in return
 and you would be repaid. ","But when you give a banquet
 invite the poor
 the crippled
 the lame
 and the blind. ","And you will be blessed
 because they cannot repay you
 for you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.\u2019","One of the dinner guests
 on hearing this
 said to him
 \u2018Blessed is anyone who will eat bread in the kingdom of God!\u2019 ","Then Jesus said to him
 \u2018Someone gave a great dinner and invited many. ","At the time for the dinner he sent his slave to say to those who had been invited
 \u201cCome; for everything is ready now.\u201d ","But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said to him
 \u201cI have bought a piece of land
 and I must go out and see it; please accept my apologies.\u201d ","Another said
 \u201cI have bought five yoke of oxen
 and I am going to try them out; please accept my apologies.\u201d ","Another said
 \u201cI have just been married
 and therefore I cannot come.\u201d ","So the slave returned and reported this to his master. Then the owner of the house became angry and said to his slave
 \u201cGo out at once into the streets and lanes of the town and bring in the poor
 the crippled
 the blind
 and the lame.\u201d ","And the slave said
 \u201cSir
 what you ordered has been done
 and there is still room.\u201d ","Then the master said to the slave
 \u201cGo out into the roads and lanes
 and compel people to come in
 so that my house may be filled. ","For I tell you
 none of those who were invited will taste my dinner.\u201d\u2019","Now large crowds were travelling with him; and he turned and said to them
 ","\u2018Whoever comes to me and does not hate father and mother
 wife and children
 brothers and sisters
 yes
 and even life itself
 cannot be my disciple. ","Whoever does not carry the cross and follow me cannot be my disciple.","For which of you
 intending to build a tower
 does not first sit down and estimate the cost
 to see whether he has enough to complete it? ","Otherwise
 when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish
 all who see it will begin to ridicule him
 ","saying
 \u201cThis fellow began to build and was not able to finish.\u201d ","Or what king
 going out to wage war against another king
 will not sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to oppose the one who comes against him with twenty thousand? ","If he cannot
 then
 while the other is still far away
 he sends a delegation and asks for the terms of peace. ","So therefore
 none of you can become my disciple if you do not give up all your possessions.","\u2018Salt is good; but if salt has lost its taste
 how can its saltiness be restored? ","It is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure heap; they throw it away. Let anyone with ears to hear listen!\u2019","\u2018Which one of you
 having a hundred sheep and losing one of them
 does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go after the one that is lost until he finds it? ","When he has found it
 he lays it on his shoulders and rejoices. ","And when he comes home
 he calls together his friends and neighbours
 saying to them
 \u201cRejoice with me
 for I have found my sheep that was lost.\u201d ","Just so
 I tell you
 there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous people who need no repentance.","\u2018Or what woman having ten silver coins
 if she loses one of them
 does not light a lamp
 sweep the house
 and search carefully until she finds it? ","When she has found it
 she calls together her friends and neighbours
 saying
 \u201cRejoice with me
 for I have found the coin that I had lost.\u201d ","Just so
 I tell you
 there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.\u2019","Then Jesus said
 \u2018There was a man who had two sons. ","The younger of them said to his father
 \u201cFather
 give me the share of the property that will belong to me.\u201d So he divided his property between them. ","A few days later the younger son gathered all he had and travelled to a distant country
 and there he squandered his property in dissolute living. ","When he had spent everything
 a severe famine took place throughout that country
 and he began to be in need. ","So he went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country
 who sent him to his fields to feed the pigs. ","He would gladly have filled himself with the pods that the pigs were eating; and no one gave him anything.","But when he came to himself he said
 \u201cHow many of my father\u2019s hired hands have bread enough and to spare
 but here I am dying of hunger! ","I will get up and go to my father
 and I will say to him
 \u2018Father
 I have sinned against heaven and before you; ","I am no longer worthy to be called your son; treat me like one of your hired hands.\u2019\u201d","So he set off and went to his father. But while he was still far off
 his father saw him and was filled with compassion; he ran and put his arms around him and kissed him. ","Then the son said to him
 \u201cFather
 I have sinned against heaven and before you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son.\u201d ","But the father said to his slaves
 \u201cQuickly
 bring out a robe\u2014the best one\u2014and put it on him; put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. ","And get the fatted calf and kill it
 and let us eat and celebrate; ","for this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found!\u201d And they began to celebrate.","\u2018Now his elder son was in the field; and when he came and approached the house
 he heard music and dancing. ","He called one of the slaves and asked what was going on.","He replied
 \u201cYour brother has come
 and your father has killed the fatted calf
 because he has got him back safe and sound.\u201d ","Then he became angry and refused to go in. His father came out and began to plead with him.","But he answered his father
 \u201cListen! For all these years I have been working like a slave for you
 and I have never disobeyed your command; yet you have never given me even a young goat so that I might celebrate with my friends. ","But when this son of yours came back
 who has devoured your property with prostitutes
 you killed the fatted calf for him!\u201d ","Then the father said to him
 \u201cSon
 you are always with me
 and all that is mine is yours. ","But we had to celebrate and rejoice
 because this brother of yours was dead and has come to life; he was lost and has been found.\u201d\u2019","Then Jesus said to the disciples
 \u2018There was a rich man who had a manager
 and charges were brought to him that this man was squandering his property. ","So he summoned him and said to him
 \u201cWhat is this that I hear about you? Give me an account of your management
 because you cannot be my manager any longer.\u201d ","Then the manager said to himself
 \u201cWhat will I do
 now that my master is taking the position away from me? I am not strong enough to dig
 and I am ashamed to beg. ","I have decided what to do so that
 when I am dismissed as manager
 people may welcome me into their homes.\u201d ","So
 summoning his master\u2019s debtors one by one
 he asked the first
 \u201cHow much do you owe my master?\u201d ","He answered
 \u201cA hundred jugs of olive oil.\u201d He said to him
 \u201cTake your bill
 sit down quickly
 and make it fifty.\u201d ","Then he asked another
 \u201cAnd how much do you owe?\u201d He replied
 \u201cA hundred containers of wheat.\u201d He said to him
 \u201cTake your bill and make it eighty.\u201d ","And his master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly; for the children of this age are more shrewd in dealing with their own generation than are the children of light.","And I tell you
 make friends for yourselves by means of dishonest wealth so that when it is gone
 they may welcome you into the eternal homes.","\u2018Whoever is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much; and whoever is dishonest in a very little is dishonest also in much.","If then you have not been faithful with the dishonest wealth
 who will entrust to you the true riches? ","And if you have not been faithful with what belongs to another
 who will give you what is your own? ","No slave can serve two masters; for a slave will either hate the one and love the other
 or be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth.\u2019","So he said to them
 \u2018You are those who justify yourselves in the sight of others; but God knows your hearts; for what is prized by human beings is an abomination in the sight of God.","\u2018The law and the prophets were in effect until John came; since then the good news of the kingdom of God is proclaimed
 and everyone tries to enter it by force. ","But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away
 than for one stroke of a letter in the law to be dropped.","\u2018Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery
 and whoever marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery.","\u2018There was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and who feasted sumptuously every day.","And at his gate lay a poor man named Lazarus
 covered with sores
 ","who longed to satisfy his hunger with what fell from the rich man\u2019s table; even the dogs would come and lick his sores.","The poor man died and was carried away by the angels to be with Abraham. The rich man also died and was buried.","In Hades
 where he was being tormented
 he looked up and saw Abraham far away with Lazarus by his side. ","He called out
 \u201cFather Abraham
 have mercy on me
 and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue; for I am in agony in these flames.\u201d ","But Abraham said
 \u201cChild
 remember that during your lifetime you received your good things
 and Lazarus in like manner evil things; but now he is comforted here
 and you are in agony. ","Besides all this
 between you and us a great chasm has been fixed
 so that those who might want to pass from here to you cannot do so
 and no one can cross from there to us.\u201d ","He said
 \u201cThen
 father
 I beg you to send him to my father\u2019s house\u2014 ","for I have five brothers\u2014that he may warn them
 so that they will not also come into this place of torment.\u201d ","Abraham replied
 \u201cThey have Moses and the prophets; they should listen to them.\u201d ","He said
 \u201cNo
 father Abraham; but if someone goes to them from the dead
 they will repent.\u201d ","He said to him
 \u201cIf they do not listen to Moses and the prophets
 neither will they be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.\u201d\u2019","Jesus said to his disciples
 \u2018Occasions for stumbling are bound to come
 but woe to anyone by whom they come! ","It would be better for you if a millstone were hung around your neck and you were thrown into the sea than for you to cause one of these little ones to stumble.","Be on your guard! If another disciple sins
 you must rebuke the offender
 and if there is repentance
 you must forgive. ","And if the same person sins against you seven times a day
 and turns back to you seven times and says
 \u201cI repent\u201d
 you must forgive.\u2019","The Lord replied
 \u2018If you had faith the size of a mustard seed
 you could say to this mulberry tree
 \u201cBe uprooted and planted in the sea\u201d
 and it would obey you.","\u2018Who among you would say to your slave who has just come in from ploughing or tending sheep in the field
 \u201cCome here at once and take your place at the table\u201d? ","Would you not rather say to him
 \u201cPrepare supper for me
 put on your apron and serve me while I eat and drink; later you may eat and drink\u201d? ","Do you thank the slave for doing what was commanded?","So you also
 when you have done all that you were ordered to do
 say
 \u201cWe are worthless slaves; we have done only what we ought to have done!\u201d\u2019","On the way to Jerusalem Jesus was going through the region between Samaria and Galilee.","When he saw them
 he said to them
 \u2018Go and show yourselves to the priests.\u2019 And as they went
 they were made clean. ","Then Jesus asked
 \u2018Were not ten made clean? But the other nine
 where are they? ","Was none of them found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?\u2019","Then he said to him
 \u2018Get up and go on your way; your faith has made you well.\u2019","Once Jesus was asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God was coming
 and he answered
 \u2018The kingdom of God is not coming with things that can be observed; ","nor will they say
 \u201cLook
 here it is!\u201d or \u201cThere it is!\u201d For
 in fact
 the kingdom of God is among you.\u2019","Then he said to the disciples
 \u2018The days are coming when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man
 and you will not see it. ","They will say to you
 \u201cLook there!\u201d or \u201cLook here!\u201d Do not go
 do not set off in pursuit. ","For as the lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one side to the other
 so will the Son of Man be in his day. ","But first he must endure much suffering and be rejected by this generation.","Just as it was in the days of Noah
 so too it will be in the days of the Son of Man. ","They were eating and drinking
 and marrying and being given in marriage
 until the day Noah entered the ark
 and the flood came and destroyed all of them. ","Likewise
 just as it was in the days of Lot: they were eating and drinking
 buying and selling
 planting and building
 ","but on the day that Lot left Sodom
 it rained fire and sulphur from heaven and destroyed all of them ","\u2014it will be like that on the day that the Son of Man is revealed.","On that day
 anyone on the housetop who has belongings in the house must not come down to take them away; and likewise anyone in the field must not turn back. ","Remember Lot\u2019s wife.","Those who try to make their life secure will lose it
 but those who lose their life will keep it. ","I tell you
 on that night there will be two in one bed; one will be taken and the other left. ","There will be two women grinding meal together; one will be taken and the other left.\u2019","Then they asked him
 \u2018Where
 Lord?\u2019 He said to them
 \u2018Where the corpse is
 there the vultures will gather.\u2019","He said
 \u2018In a certain city there was a judge who neither feared God nor had respect for people. ","In that city there was a widow who kept coming to him and saying
 \u201cGrant me justice against my opponent.\u201d ","For a while he refused; but later he said to himself
 \u201cThough I have no fear of God and no respect for anyone
 ","yet because this widow keeps bothering me
 I will grant her justice
 so that she may not wear me out by continually coming.\u201d\u2019 ","And the Lord said
 \u2018Listen to what the unjust judge says. ","And will not God grant justice to his chosen ones who cry to him day and night? Will he delay long in helping them?","I tell you
 he will quickly grant justice to them. And yet
 when the Son of Man comes
 will he find faith on earth?\u2019","\u2018Two men went up to the temple to pray
 one a Pharisee and the other a tax-collector. ","The Pharisee
 standing by himself
 was praying thus
 \u201cGod
 I thank you that I am not like other people: thieves
 rogues
 adulterers
 or even like this tax-collector. ","I fast twice a week; I give a tenth of all my income.\u201d","But the tax-collector
 standing far off
 would not even look up to heaven
 but was beating his breast and saying
 \u201cGod
 be merciful to me
 a sinner!\u201d ","I tell you
 this man went down to his home justified rather than the other; for all who exalt themselves will be humbled
 but all who humble themselves will be exalted.\u2019","But Jesus called for them and said
 \u2018Let the little children come to me
 and do not stop them; for it is to such as these that the kingdom of God belongs. ","Truly I tell you
 whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will never enter it.\u2019","Jesus said to him
 \u2018Why do you call me good? No one is good but God alone. ","You know the commandments: \u201cYou shall not commit adultery; You shall not murder; You shall not steal; You shall not bear false witness; Honour your father and mother.\u201d\u2019","He replied
 \u2018I have kept all these since my youth.\u2019 ","When Jesus heard this
 he said to him
 \u2018There is still one thing lacking. Sell all that you own and distribute the money to the poor
 and you will have treasure in heaven; then come
 follow me.\u2019 ","Jesus looked at him and said
 \u2018How hard it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God! ","Indeed
 it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.\u2019","He replied
 \u2018What is impossible for mortals is possible for God.\u2019","And he said to them
 \u2018Truly I tell you
 there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children
 for the sake of the kingdom of God
 ","who will not get back very much more in this age
 and in the age to come eternal life.\u2019","Then he took the twelve aside and said to them
 \u2018See
 we are going up to Jerusalem
 and everything that is written about the Son of Man by the prophets will be accomplished. ","For he will be handed over to the Gentiles; and he will be mocked and insulted and spat upon.","After they have flogged him
 they will kill him
 and on the third day he will rise again.\u2019 ","But they understood nothing about all these things; in fact
 what he said was hidden from them
 and they did not grasp what was said.","\u2018What do you want me to do for you?\u2019 He said
 \u2018Lord
 let me see again.\u2019 ","Jesus said to him
 \u2018Receive your sight; your faith has saved you.\u2019 ","When Jesus came to the place
 he looked up and said to him

 hurry and come down; for I must stay at your house today.\u2019 ","Zacchaeus stood there and said to the Lord
 \u2018Look
 half of my possessions
 Lord
 I will give to the poor; and if I have defrauded anyone of anything
 I will pay back four times as much.\u2019 ","Then Jesus said to him
 \u2018Today salvation has come to this house
 because he too is a son of Abraham. ","For the Son of Man came to seek out and to save the lost.\u2019","So he said
 \u2018A nobleman went to a distant country to get royal power for himself and then return. ","He summoned ten of his slaves
 and gave them ten pounds
 and said to them
 \u201cDo business with these until I come back.\u201d ","But the citizens of his country hated him and sent a delegation after him
 saying
 \u201cWe do not want this man to rule over us.\u201d ","When he returned
 having received royal power
 he ordered these slaves
 to whom he had given the money
 to be summoned so that he might find out what they had gained by trading. ","The first came forward and said
 \u201cLord
 your pound has made ten more pounds.\u201d ","He said to him
 \u201cWell done
 good slave! Because you have been trustworthy in a very small thing
 take charge of ten cities.\u201d ","Then the second came
 saying
 \u201cLord
 your pound has made five pounds.\u201d ","He said to him
 \u201cAnd you
 rule over five cities.\u201d ","Then the other came
 saying
 \u201cLord
 here is your pound. I wrapped it up in a piece of cloth
 ","for I was afraid of you
 because you are a harsh man; you take what you did not deposit
 and reap what you did not sow.\u201d ","He said to him
 \u201cI will judge you by your own words
 you wicked slave! You knew
 did you
 that I was a harsh man
 taking what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not sow? ","Why then did you not put my money into the bank? Then when I returned
 I could have collected it with interest.\u201d ","He said to the bystanders
 \u201cTake the pound from him and give it to the one who has ten pounds.\u201d ","(And they said to him
 \u201cLord
 he has ten pounds!\u201d) ","\u201cI tell you
 to all those who have
 more will be given; but from those who have nothing
 even what they have will be taken away. ","But as for these enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them\u2014bring them here and slaughter them in my presence.\u201d\u2019","saying
 \u2018Go into the village ahead of you
 and as you enter it you will find tied there a colt that has never been ridden. Untie it and bring it here. ","If anyone asks you
 \u201cWhy are you untying it?\u201d just say this: \u201cThe Lord needs it.\u201d\u2019 ","Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him
 \u2018Teacher
 order your disciples to stop.\u2019 ","He answered
 \u2018I tell you
 if these were silent
 the stones would shout out.\u2019","saying
 \u2018If you
 even you
 had only recognized on this day the things that make for peace! But now they are hidden from your eyes. ","Indeed
 the days will come upon you
 when your enemies will set up ramparts around you and surround you
 and hem you in on every side. ","They will crush you to the ground
 you and your children within you
 and they will not leave within you one stone upon another; because you did not recognize the time of your visitation from God.\u2019","and he said
 \u2018It is written
 \u201cMy house shall be a house of prayer\u201d; but you have made it a den of robbers.\u2019","He answered them
 \u2018I will also ask you a question
 and you tell me: ","Did the baptism of John come from heaven
 or was it of human origin?\u2019 ","Then Jesus said to them
 \u2018Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.\u2019","He began to tell the people this parable: \u2018A man planted a vineyard
 and leased it to tenants
 and went to another country for a long time. ","When the season came
 he sent a slave to the tenants in order that they might give him his share of the produce of the vineyard; but the tenants beat him and sent him away empty-handed. ","Next he sent another slave; that one also they beat and insulted and sent away empty-handed.","And he sent yet a third; this one also they wounded and threw out.","Then the owner of the vineyard said
 \u201cWhat shall I do? I will send my beloved son; perhaps they will respect him.\u201d ","But when the tenants saw him
 they discussed it among themselves and said
 \u201cThis is the heir; let us kill him so that the inheritance may be ours.\u201d ","So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?","He will come and destroy those tenants and give the vineyard to others.\u2019 When they heard this
 they said
 \u2018Heaven forbid!\u2019 ","But he looked at them and said
 \u2018What then does this text mean: \u201cThe stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone\u201d?","Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces; and it will crush anyone on whom it falls.\u2019","So they watched him and sent spies who pretended to be honest
 in order to trap him by what he said
 so as to hand him over to the jurisdiction and authority of the governor. ","\u2018Show me a denarius. Whose head and whose title does it bear?\u2019 They said
 \u2018The emperor\u2019s.\u2019 ","He said to them
 \u2018Then give to the emperor the things that are the emperor\u2019s
 and to God the things that are God\u2019s.\u2019 ","And they were not able in the presence of the people to trap him by what he said; and being amazed by his answer
 they became silent.","Jesus said to them
 \u2018Those who belong to this age marry and are given in marriage; ","but those who are considered worthy of a place in that age and in the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage.","Indeed they cannot die any more
 because they are like angels and are children of God
 being children of the resurrection. ","And the fact that the dead are raised Moses himself showed
 in the story about the bush
 where he speaks of the Lord as the God of Abraham
 the God of Isaac
 and the God of Jacob. ","Now he is God not of the dead
 but of the living; for to him all of them are alive.\u2019 ","Then he said to them
 \u2018How can they say that the Messiah is David\u2019s son? ","For David himself says in the book of Psalms
 \u201cThe Lord said to my Lord
 \u2018Sit at my right hand
","until I make your enemies your footstool.\u2019\u201d","David thus calls him Lord; so how can he be his son?\u2019","\u2018Beware of the scribes
 who like to walk around in long robes
 and love to be greeted with respect in the market-places
 and to have the best seats in the synagogues and places of honour at banquets. ","They devour widows\u2019 houses and for the sake of appearance say long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation.\u2019","He said
 \u2018Truly I tell you
 this poor widow has put in more than all of them; ","for all of them have contributed out of their abundance
 but she out of her poverty has put in all she had to live on.\u2019","\u2018As for these things that you see
 the days will come when not one stone will be left upon another; all will be thrown down.\u2019","And he said
 \u2018Beware that you are not led astray; for many will come in my name and say
 \u201cI am he!\u201d and
 \u201cThe time is near!\u201d Do not go after them.","\u2018When you hear of wars and insurrections
 do not be terrified; for these things must take place first
 but the end will not follow immediately.\u2019 ","Then he said to them
 \u2018Nation will rise against nation
 and kingdom against kingdom; ","there will be great earthquakes
 and in various places famines and plagues; and there will be dreadful portents and great signs from heaven.","\u2018But before all this occurs
 they will arrest you and persecute you; they will hand you over to synagogues and prisons
 and you will be brought before kings and governors because of my name. ","This will give you an opportunity to testify.","So make up your minds not to prepare your defence in advance;","for I will give you words and a wisdom that none of your opponents will be able to withstand or contradict.","You will be betrayed even by parents and brothers
 by relatives and friends; and they will put some of you to death. ","You will be hated by all because of my name.","But not a hair of your head will perish.","By your endurance you will gain your souls.","\u2018When you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies
 then know that its desolation has come near. ","Then those in Judea must flee to the mountains
 and those inside the city must leave it
 and those out in the country must not enter it; ","for these are days of vengeance
 as a fulfilment of all that is written. ","Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing infants in those days! For there will be great distress on the earth and wrath against this people;","they will fall by the edge of the sword and be taken away as captives among all nations; and Jerusalem will be trampled on by the Gentiles
 until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.","\u2018There will be signs in the sun
 the moon
 and the stars
 and on the earth distress among nations confused by the roaring of the sea and the waves. ","People will faint from fear and foreboding of what is coming upon the world
 for the powers of the heavens will be shaken. ","Then they will see \u201cthe Son of Man coming in a cloud\u201d with power and great glory.","Now when these things begin to take place
 stand up and raise your heads
 because your redemption is drawing near.\u2019","Then he told them a parable: \u2018Look at the fig tree and all the trees;","as soon as they sprout leaves you can see for yourselves and know that summer is already near.","So also
 when you see these things taking place
 you know that the kingdom of God is near. ","Truly I tell you
 this generation will not pass away until all things have taken place. ","Heaven and earth will pass away
 but my words will not pass away.","\u2018Be on guard so that your hearts are not weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and the worries of this life
 and that day does not catch you unexpectedly
 ","like a trap. For it will come upon all who live on the face of the whole earth.","Be alert at all times
 praying that you may have the strength to escape all these things that will take place
 and to stand before the Son of Man.\u2019","So Jesus sent Peter and John
 saying
 \u2018Go and prepare the Passover meal for us that we may eat it.\u2019 ","\u2018Listen
\u2019 he said to them
 \u2018when you have entered the city
 a man carrying a jar of water will meet you; follow him into the house he enters ","and say to the owner of the house
 \u201cThe teacher asks you
 \u2018Where is the guest room
 where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?\u2019\u201d ","He will show you a large room upstairs
 already furnished. Make preparations for us there.\u2019 ","He said to them
 \u2018I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer; ","for I tell you
 I will not eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.\u2019 ","Then he took a cup
 and after giving thanks he said
 \u2018Take this and divide it among yourselves; ","for I tell you that from now on I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.\u2019","Then he took a loaf of bread
 and when he had given thanks
 he broke it and gave it to them
 saying
 \u2018This is my body
 which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me.\u2019 ","And he did the same with the cup after supper
 saying
 \u2018This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood. ","But see
 the one who betrays me is with me
 and his hand is on the table. ","For the Son of Man is going as it has been determined
 but woe to that one by whom he is betrayed!\u2019 ","But he said to them
 \u2018The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and those in authority over them are called benefactors. ","But not so with you; rather the greatest among you must become like the youngest
 and the leader like one who serves. ","For who is greater
 the one who is at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one at the table? But I am among you as one who serves.","\u2018You are those who have stood by me in my trials;","and I confer on you
 just as my Father has conferred on me
 a kingdom
 ","so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom
 and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.","\u2018Simon
 Simon
 listen! Satan has demanded to sift all of you like wheat
 ","but I have prayed for you that your own faith may not fail; and you
 when once you have turned back
 strengthen your brothers.\u2019 ","And he said to him
 \u2018Lord
 I am ready to go with you to prison and to death!\u2019 ","Jesus said
 \u2018I tell you
 Peter
 the cock will not crow this day
 until you have denied three times that you know me.\u2019","He said to them
 \u2018When I sent you out without a purse
 bag
 or sandals
 did you lack anything?\u2019 They said
 \u2018No
 not a thing.\u2019 ","He said to them
 \u2018But now
 the one who has a purse must take it
 and likewise a bag. And the one who has no sword must sell his cloak and buy one. ","For I tell you
 this scripture must be fulfilled in me
 \u201cAnd he was counted among the lawless\u201d; and indeed what is written about me is being fulfilled.\u2019 ","They said
 \u2018Lord
 look
 here are two swords.\u2019 He replied
 \u2018It is enough.\u2019","When he reached the place
 he said to them
 \u2018Pray that you may not come into the time of trial.\u2019 ","\u2018Father
 if you are willing
 remove this cup from me; yet
 not my will but yours be done.\u2019 ","and he said to them
 \u2018Why are you sleeping? Get up and pray that you may not come into the time of trial.\u2019","but Jesus said to him
 \u2018Judas
 is it with a kiss that you are betraying the Son of Man?\u2019 ","But Jesus said
 \u2018No more of this!\u2019 And he touched his ear and healed him. ","Then Jesus said to the chief priests
 the officers of the temple police
 and the elders who had come for him
 \u2018Have you come out with swords and clubs as if I were a bandit? ","When I was with you day after day in the temple
 you did not lay hands on me. But this is your hour
 and the power of darkness!\u2019","The Lord turned and looked at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word of the Lord
 how he had said to him
 \u2018Before the cock crows today
 you will deny me three times.\u2019 ","They said
 \u2018If you are the Messiah
 tell us.\u2019 He replied
 \u2018If I tell you
 you will not believe; ","and if I question you
 you will not answer. ","But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.\u2019","All of them asked
 \u2018Are you
 then
 the Son of God?\u2019 He said to them
 \u2018You say that I am.\u2019 ","Then Pilate asked him
 \u2018Are you the king of the Jews?\u2019 He answered
 \u2018You say so.\u2019 ","When Pilate heard this
 he asked whether the man was a Galilean. ","and said to them
 \u2018You brought me this man as one who was perverting the people; and here I have examined him in your presence and have not found this man guilty of any of your charges against him. ","A third time he said to them
 \u2018Why
 what evil has he done? I have found in him no ground for the sentence of death; I will therefore have him flogged and then release him.\u2019 ","But Jesus turned to them and said
 \u2018Daughters of Jerusalem
 do not weep for me
 but weep for yourselves and for your children. ","For the days are surely coming when they will say
 \u201cBlessed are the barren
 and the wombs that never bore
 and the breasts that never nursed.\u201d ","Then they will begin to say to the mountains
 \u201cFall on us\u201d; and to the hills
 \u201cCover us.\u201d ","For if they do this when the wood is green
 what will happen when it is dry?\u2019","Then Jesus said
 \u2018Father
 forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing.\u2019]] And they cast lots to divide his clothing. ","He replied
 \u2018Truly I tell you
 today you will be with me in Paradise.\u2019","Then Jesus
 crying with a loud voice
 said
 \u2018Father
 into your hands I commend my spirit.\u2019 Having said this
 he breathed his last. ","The women were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground
 but the men said to them
 \u2018Why do you look for the living among the dead? He is not here
 but has risen. ","And he said to them
 \u2018What are you discussing with each other while you walk along?\u2019 They stood still
 looking sad. ","He asked them
 \u2018What things?\u2019 They replied
 \u2018The things about Jesus of Nazareth
 who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people
 ","Then he said to them
 \u2018Oh
 how foolish you are
 and how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have declared! ","Was it not necessary that the Messiah should suffer these things and then enter into his glory?\u2019","While they were talking about this
 Jesus himself stood among them and said to them
 \u2018Peace be with you.\u2019 ","He said to them
 \u2018Why are you frightened
 and why do doubts arise in your hearts? ","Look at my hands and my feet; see that it is I myself. Touch me and see; for a ghost does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have.\u2019","While in their joy they were disbelieving and still wondering
 he said to them
 \u2018Have you anything here to eat?\u2019 ","Then he said to them
 \u2018These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you\u2014that everything written about me in the law of Moses
 the prophets
 and the psalms must be fulfilled.\u2019 ","and he said to them
 \u2018Thus it is written
 that the Messiah is to suffer and to rise from the dead on the third day
 ","and that repentance and forgiveness of sins is to be proclaimed in his name to all nations
 beginning from Jerusalem. ","You are witnesses of these things.","And see
 I am sending upon you what my Father promised; so stay here in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high.\u2019","He said to them
 \u201cWhy were you searching for me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father\u2019s house?\u201d ","Jesus answered him
 \u201cIt is written
 \u2018One does not live by bread alone.\u2019\u201d","And the devil said to him
 \u201cTo you I will give their glory and all this authority; for it has been given over to me
 and I give it to anyone I please. ","Jesus answered him
 \u201cIt is written
 \u2018Worship the Lord your God
 and serve only him.\u2019\u201d","Then the devil took him to Jerusalem
 and placed him on the pinnacle of the temple
 saying to him
 \u201cIf you are the Son of God
 throw yourself down from here
 ","Jesus answered him
 \u201cIt is said
 \u2018Do not put the Lord your God to the test.\u2019\u201d ","\u201cThe Spirit of the Lord is upon me
 because he has anointed me to bring good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind
 to let the oppressed go free
","to proclaim the year of the Lord\u2019s favor.\u201d","Then he began to say to them
 \u201cToday this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cDoubtless you will quote to me this proverb
 \u2018Doctor
 cure yourself!\u2019 And you will say
 \u2018Do here also in your hometown the things that we have heard you did at Capernaum.\u2019\u201d ","And he said
 \u201cTruly I tell you
 no prophet is accepted in the prophet\u2019s hometown. ","But the truth is
 there were many widows in Israel in the time of Elijah
 when the heaven was shut up three years and six months
 and there was a severe famine over all the land; ","yet Elijah was sent to none of them except to a widow at Zarephath in Sidon.","There were also many lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha
 and none of them was cleansed except Naaman the Syrian.\u201d ","They were astounded at his teaching
 because he spoke with authority. ","But Jesus rebuked him
 saying
 \u201cBe silent
 and come out of him!\u201d When the demon had thrown him down before them
 he came out of him without having done him any harm. ","Demons also came out of many
 shouting
 \u201cYou are the Son of God!\u201d But he rebuked them and would not allow them to speak
 because they knew that he was the Messiah.","But he said to them
 \u201cI must proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God to the other cities also; for I was sent for this purpose.\u201d ","When he had finished speaking
 he said to Simon
 \u201cPut out into the deep water and let down your nets for a catch.\u201d ","and so also were James and John
 sons of Zebedee
 who were partners with Simon. Then Jesus said to Simon
 \u201cDo not be afraid; from now on you will be catching people.\u201d ","Then Jesus stretched out his hand
 touched him
 and said
 \u201cI do choose. Be made clean.\u201d Immediately the leprosy left him. ","And he ordered him to tell no one. \u201cGo
\u201d he said
 \u201cand show yourself to the priest
 and
 as Moses commanded
 make an offering for your cleansing
 for a testimony to them.\u201d ","When he saw their faith
 he said
 \u201cFriend
 your sins are forgiven you.\u201d ","When Jesus perceived their questionings
 he answered them
 \u201cWhy do you raise such questions in your hearts? ","Which is easier
 to say
 \u2018Your sins are forgiven you
\u2019 or to say
 \u2018Stand up and walk\u2019? ","But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins\u201d\u2014he said to the one who was paralyzed\u2014\u201cI say to you
 stand up and take your bed and go to your home.\u201d ","After this he went out and saw a tax collector named Levi
 sitting at the tax booth; and he said to him
 \u201cFollow me.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cThose who are well have no need of a physician

 \u201cJohn\u2019s disciples

 \u201cYou cannot make wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them

 and the piece from the new will not match the old. ","And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; otherwise the new wine will burst the skins and will be spilled
 and the skins will be destroyed. ","But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins.","And no one after drinking old wine desires new wine
 but says
 \u2018The old is good.\u2019\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cHave you not read what David did when he and his companions were hungry? ","He entered the house of God and took and ate the bread of the Presence

 do not ask for them again. ","Do to others as you would have them do to you.","\u201cIf you love those who love you
 what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them. ","If you do good to those who do good to you

 to receive as much again. ","But love your enemies
 do good

 \u201cDo not weep.\u201d ","Then he came forward and touched the bier
 and the bearers stood still. And he said
 \u201cYoung man
 I say to you
 rise!\u201d ","And he answered them
 \u201cGo and tell John what you have seen and heard: the blind receive their sight
 the lame walk
 the lepers are cleansed
 the deaf hear
 the dead are raised
 the poor have good news brought to them. ","And blessed is anyone who takes no offense at me.\u201d","When John\u2019s messengers had gone
 Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: \u201cWhat did you go out into the wilderness to look at? A reed shaken by the wind? ","What then did you go out to see? Someone dressed in soft robes? Look
 those who put on fine clothing and live in luxury are in royal palaces. ","What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes
 I tell you
 and more than a prophet. ","This is the one about whom it is written
 \u2018See
 I am sending my messenger ahead of you
 who will prepare your way before you.\u2019","I tell you
 among those born of women no one is greater than John; yet the least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.\u201d ","\u201cTo what then will I compare the people of this generation
 and what are they like? ","They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling to one another
 \u2018We played the flute for you
 and you did not dance; we wailed
 and you did not weep.\u2019","For John the Baptist has come eating no bread and drinking no wine
 and you say
 \u2018He has a demon\u2019; ","the Son of Man has come eating and drinking
 and you say
 \u2018Look
 a glutton and a drunkard
 a friend of tax collectors and sinners!\u2019 ","Nevertheless
 wisdom is vindicated by all her children.\u201d","Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw it
 he said to himself
 \u201cIf this man were a prophet
 he would have known who and what kind of woman this is who is touching him\u2014that she is a sinner.\u201d ","Jesus spoke up and said to him
 \u201cSimon
 I have something to say to you.\u201d \u201cTeacher
\u201d he replied
 \u201cspeak.\u201d ","\u201cA certain creditor had two debtors; one owed five hundred denarii
 and the other fifty. ","When they could not pay
 he canceled the debts for both of them. Now which of them will love him more?\u201d ","Simon answered
 \u201cI suppose the one for whom he canceled the greater debt.\u201d And Jesus said to him
 \u201cYou have judged rightly.\u201d ","Then turning toward the woman
 he said to Simon
 \u201cDo you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave me no water for my feet
 but she has bathed my feet with her tears and dried them with her hair. ","You gave me no kiss
 but from the time I came in she has not stopped kissing my feet. ","You did not anoint my head with oil
 but she has anointed my feet with ointment. ","Therefore
 I tell you
 her sins
 which were many
 have been forgiven; hence she has shown great love. But the one to whom little is forgiven
 loves little.\u201d ","Then he said to her
 \u201cYour sins are forgiven.\u201d ","And he said to the woman
 \u201cYour faith has saved you; go in peace.\u201d","When a great crowd gathered and people from town after town came to him
 he said in a parable: ","\u201cA sower went out to sow his seed; and as he sowed
 some fell on the path and was trampled on
 and the birds of the air ate it up. ","Some fell on the rock; and as it grew up
 it withered for lack of moisture. ","Some fell among thorns
 and the thorns grew with it and choked it. ","Some fell into good soil
 and when it grew
 it produced a hundredfold.\u201d As he said this
 he called out
 \u201cLet anyone with ears to hear listen!\u201d","He said
 \u201cTo you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of God; but to others I speak in parables
 so that \u2018looking they may not perceive
 and listening they may not understand.\u2019","\u201cNow the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.","The ones on the path are those who have heard; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts
 so that they may not believe and be saved. ","The ones on the rock are those who
 when they hear the word
 receive it with joy. But these have no root; they believe only for a while and in a time of testing fall away. ","As for what fell among the thorns
 these are the ones who hear; but as they go on their way
 they are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life
 and their fruit does not mature. ","But as for that in the good soil
 these are the ones who
 when they hear the word
 hold it fast in an honest and good heart
 and bear fruit with patient endurance.","\u201cNo one after lighting a lamp hides it under a jar
 or puts it under a bed
 but puts it on a lampstand
 so that those who enter may see the light. ","For nothing is hidden that will not be disclosed
 nor is anything secret that will not become known and come to light. ","Then pay attention to how you listen; for to those who have
 more will be given; and from those who do not have
 even what they seem to have will be taken away.\u201d","And he was told
 \u201cYour mother and your brothers are standing outside
 wanting to see you.\u201d ","But he said to them
 \u201cMy mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God and do it.\u201d","One day he got into a boat with his disciples
 and he said to them
 \u201cLet us go across to the other side of the lake.\u201d So they put out
 ","He said to them
 \u201cWhere is your faith?\u201d They were afraid and amazed
 and said to one another
 \u201cWho then is this
 that he commands even the winds and the water
 and they obey him?\u201d","Jesus then asked him
 \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d He said
 \u201cLegion\u201d; for many demons had entered him. ","\u201cReturn to your home
 and declare how much God has done for you.\u201d So he went away
 proclaiming throughout the city how much Jesus had done for him.","Then Jesus asked
 \u201cWho touched me?\u201d When all denied it
 Peter said
 \u201cMaster
 the crowds surround you and press in on you.\u201d ","But Jesus said
 \u201cSomeone touched me; for I noticed that power had gone out from me.\u201d ","He said to her
 \u201cDaughter
 your faith has made you well; go in peace.\u201d","When Jesus heard this
 he replied
 \u201cDo not fear. Only believe
 and she will be saved.\u201d ","They were all weeping and wailing for her; but he said
 \u201cDo not weep; for she is not dead but sleeping.\u201d ","But he took her by the hand and called out
 \u201cChild
 get up!\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cTake nothing for your journey
 no staff
 nor bag
 nor bread
 nor money\u2014not even an extra tunic. ","Whatever house you enter
 stay there
 and leave from there. ","Wherever they do not welcome you
 as you are leaving that town shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them.\u201d ","But he said to them
 \u201cYou give them something to eat.\u201d They said
 \u201cWe have no more than five loaves and two fish\u2014unless we are to go and buy food for all these people.\u201d ","For there were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples
 \u201cMake them sit down in groups of about fifty each.\u201d ","Once when Jesus was praying alone
 with only the disciples near him
 he asked them
 \u201cWho do the crowds say that I am?\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cBut who do you say that I am?\u201d Peter answered
 \u201cThe Messiah of God.\u201d","saying
 \u201cThe Son of Man must undergo great suffering
 and be rejected by the elders
 chief priests
 and scribes
 and be killed
 and on the third day be raised.\u201d","Then he said to them all
 \u201cIf any want to become my followers
 let them deny themselves and take up their cross daily and follow me. ","For those who want to save their life will lose it
 and those who lose their life for my sake will save it. ","What does it profit them if they gain the whole world
 but lose or forfeit themselves? ","Those who are ashamed of me and of my words
 of them the Son of Man will be ashamed when he comes in his glory and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels. ","But truly I tell you
 there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God.\u201d","Just as they were leaving him
 Peter said to Jesus
 \u201cMaster
 it is good for us to be here; let us make three dwellings
 one for you
 one for Moses
 and one for Elijah\u201d\u2014not knowing what he said. ","Jesus answered
 \u201cYou faithless and perverse generation
 how much longer must I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here.\u201d ","\u201cLet these words sink into your ears: The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into human hands.\u201d","and said to them
 \u201cWhoever welcomes this child in my name welcomes me
 and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me; for the least among all of you is the greatest.\u201d","But Jesus said to him
 \u201cDo not stop him; for whoever is not against you is for you.\u201d","And Jesus said to him
 \u201cFoxes have holes
 and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.\u201d ","To another he said
 \u201cFollow me.\u201d But he said
 \u201cLord
 first let me go and bury my father.\u201d ","But Jesus said to him
 \u201cLet the dead bury their own dead; but as for you
 go and proclaim the kingdom of God.\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cNo one who puts a hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cThe harvest is plentiful
 but the laborers are few; therefore ask the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest. ","Go on your way. See
 I am sending you out like lambs into the midst of wolves. ","Carry no purse
 no bag
 no sandals; and greet no one on the road. ","Whatever house you enter
 first say
 \u2018Peace to this house!\u2019 ","And if anyone is there who shares in peace
 your peace will rest on that person; but if not
 it will return to you. ","Remain in the same house
 eating and drinking whatever they provide
 for the laborer deserves to be paid. Do not move about from house to house. ","Whenever you enter a town and its people welcome you
 eat what is set before you; ","cure the sick who are there
 and say to them
 \u2018The kingdom of God has come near to you.\u2019 ","But whenever you enter a town and they do not welcome you
 go out into its streets and say
 ","\u2018Even the dust of your town that clings to our feet
 we wipe off in protest against you. Yet know this: the kingdom of God has come near.\u2019 ","I tell you
 on that day it will be more tolerable for Sodom than for that town.","\u201cWoe to you
 Chorazin! Woe to you
 Bethsaida! For if the deeds of power done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon
 they would have repented long ago
 sitting in sackcloth and ashes. ","But at the judgment it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon than for you.","And you
 Capernaum
 will you be exalted to heaven? No
 you will be brought down to Hades.","\u201cWhoever listens to you listens to me
 and whoever rejects you rejects me
 and whoever rejects me rejects the one who sent me.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cI watched Satan fall from heaven like a flash of lightning. ","See
 I have given you authority to tread on snakes and scorpions
 and over all the power of the enemy; and nothing will hurt you. ","Nevertheless
 do not rejoice at this
 that the spirits submit to you
 but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.\u201d","At that same hour Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said
 \u201cI thank you
 Father
 Lord of heaven and earth
 because you have hidden these things from the wise and the intelligent and have revealed them to infants; yes
 Father
 for such was your gracious will. ","All things have been handed over to me by my Father; and no one knows who the Son is except the Father
 or who the Father is except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.\u201d","Then turning to the disciples
 Jesus said to them privately
 \u201cBlessed are the eyes that see what you see! ","For I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see what you see
 but did not see it
 and to hear what you hear
 but did not hear it.\u201d","Just then a lawyer stood up to test Jesus. \u201cTeacher
\u201d he said
 \u201cwhat must I do to inherit eternal life?\u201d ","He said to him
 \u201cWhat is written in the law? What do you read there?\u201d ","And he said to him
 \u201cYou have given the right answer; do this
 and you will live.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cA man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho
 and fell into the hands of robbers
 who stripped him
 beat him
 and went away
 leaving him half dead. ","Now by chance a priest was going down that road; and when he saw him
 he passed by on the other side. ","So likewise a Levite
 when he came to the place and saw him
 passed by on the other side. ","But a Samaritan while traveling came near him; and when he saw him
 he was moved with pity. ","He went to him and bandaged his wounds
 having poured oil and wine on them. Then he put him on his own animal
 brought him to an inn
 and took care of him. ","The next day he took out two denarii
 gave them to the innkeeper
 and said
 \u2018Take care of him; and when I come back
 I will repay you whatever more you spend.\u2019 ","Which of these three
 do you think
 was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of the robbers?\u201d ","He said
 \u201cThe one who showed him mercy.\u201d Jesus said to him
 \u201cGo and do likewise.\u201d","But the Lord answered her
 \u201cMartha
 Martha
 you are worried and distracted by many things; ","there is need of only one thing. Mary has chosen the better part
 which will not be taken away from her.\u201d","He was praying in a certain place
 and after he had finished
 one of his disciples said to him
 \u201cLord
 teach us to pray
 as John taught his disciples.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cWhen you pray
 say: Father
 hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come.","Give us each day our daily bread.","    And forgive us our sins
 for we ourselves forgive everyone indebted to us. And do not bring us to the time of trial.\u201d","And he said to them
 \u201cSuppose one of you has a friend
 and you go to him at midnight and say to him
 \u2018Friend
 lend me three loaves of bread; ","for a friend of mine has arrived
 and I have nothing to set before him.\u2019 ","And he answers from within
 \u2018Do not bother me; the door has already been locked
 and my children are with me in bed; I cannot get up and give you anything.\u2019 ","I tell you
 even though he will not get up and give him anything because he is his friend
 at least because of his persistence he will get up and give him whatever he needs.","\u201cSo I say to you
 Ask
 and it will be given you; search
 and you will find; knock
 and the door will be opened for you. ","For everyone who asks receives
 and everyone who searches finds
 and for everyone who knocks
 the door will be opened. ","Is there anyone among you who
 if your child asks for a fish
 will give a snake instead of a fish? ","Or if the child asks for an egg
 will give a scorpion? ","If you then
 who are evil
 know how to give good gifts to your children
 how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!\u201d","Now he was casting out a demon that was mute; when the demon had gone out
 the one who had been mute spoke
 and the crowds were amazed. ","But he knew what they were thinking and said to them
 \u201cEvery kingdom divided against itself becomes a desert
 and house falls on house. ","If Satan also is divided against himself
 how will his kingdom stand? \u2014for you say that I cast out the demons by Beelzebul. ","Now if I cast out the demons by Beelzebul
 by whom do your exorcists cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges. ","But if it is by the finger of God that I cast out the demons
 then the kingdom of God has come to you. ","When a strong man
 fully armed
 guards his castle
 his property is safe. ","But when one stronger than he attacks him and overpowers him
 he takes away his armor in which he trusted and divides his plunder. ","Whoever is not with me is against me
 and whoever does not gather with me scatters.","\u201cWhen the unclean spirit has gone out of a person
 it wanders through waterless regions looking for a resting place
 but not finding any
 it says
 \u2018I will return to my house from which I came.\u2019 ","When it comes
 it finds it swept and put in order. ","Then it goes and brings seven other spirits more evil than itself
 and they enter and live there; and the last state of that person is worse than the first.\u201d","While he was saying this
 a woman in the crowd raised her voice and said to him
 \u201cBlessed is the womb that bore you and the breasts that nursed you!\u201d ","But he said
 \u201cBlessed rather are those who hear the word of God and obey it!\u201d","When the crowds were increasing
 he began to say
 \u201cThis generation is an evil generation; it asks for a sign
 but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah. ","For just as Jonah became a sign to the people of Nineveh
 so the Son of Man will be to this generation. ","The queen of the South will rise at the judgment with the people of this generation and condemn them
 because she came from the ends of the earth to listen to the wisdom of Solomon
 and see
 something greater than Solomon is here! ","The people of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it
 because they repented at the proclamation of Jonah
 and see
 something greater than Jonah is here!","\u201cNo one after lighting a lamp puts it in a cellar
 but on the lampstand so that those who enter may see the light. ","Your eye is the lamp of your body. If your eye is healthy
 your whole body is full of light; but if it is not healthy
 your body is full of darkness. ","Therefore consider whether the light in you is not darkness.","If then your whole body is full of light
 with no part of it in darkness
 it will be as full of light as when a lamp gives you light with its rays.\u201d","Then the Lord said to him
 \u201cNow you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and of the dish
 but inside you are full of greed and wickedness. ","You fools! Did not the one who made the outside make the inside also?","So give for alms those things that are within; and see
 everything will be clean for you.","\u201cBut woe to you Pharisees! For you tithe mint and rue and herbs of all kinds
 and neglect justice and the love of God; it is these you ought to have practiced
 without neglecting the others. ","Woe to you Pharisees! For you love to have the seat of honor in the synagogues and to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces.","Woe to you! For you are like unmarked graves
 and people walk over them without realizing it.\u201d","And he said
 \u201cWoe also to you lawyers! For you load people with burdens hard to bear
 and you yourselves do not lift a finger to ease them. ","Woe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets whom your ancestors killed.","So you are witnesses and approve of the deeds of your ancestors; for they killed them
 and you build their tombs. ","Therefore also the Wisdom of God said
 \u2018I will send them prophets and apostles
 some of whom they will kill and persecute
\u2019 ","so that this generation may be charged with the blood of all the prophets shed since the foundation of the world
 ","from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah
 who perished between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes
 I tell you
 it will be charged against this generation. ","Woe to you lawyers! For you have taken away the key of knowledge; you did not enter yourselves
 and you hindered those who were entering.\u201d","Meanwhile
 when the crowd gathered by the thousands
 so that they trampled on one another
 he began to speak first to his disciples
 \u201cBeware of the yeast of the Pharisees
 that is
 their hypocrisy. ","Nothing is covered up that will not be uncovered
 and nothing secret that will not become known. ","Therefore whatever you have said in the dark will be heard in the light
 and what you have whispered behind closed doors will be proclaimed from the housetops.","\u201cI tell you
 my friends
 do not fear those who kill the body
 and after that can do nothing more. ","But I will warn you whom to fear: fear him who
 after he has killed
 has authority to cast into hell. Yes
 I tell you
 fear him! ","Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? Yet not one of them is forgotten in God\u2019s sight.","But even the hairs of your head are all counted. Do not be afraid; you are of more value than many sparrows.","\u201cAnd I tell you
 everyone who acknowledges me before others
 the Son of Man also will acknowledge before the angels of God; ","but whoever denies me before others will be denied before the angels of God.","And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven; but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.","When they bring you before the synagogues
 the rulers
 and the authorities
 do not worry about how you are to defend yourselves or what you are to say; ","for the Holy Spirit will teach you at that very hour what you ought to say.\u201d","But he said to him
 \u201cFriend
 who set me to be a judge or arbitrator over you?\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cTake care! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; for one\u2019s life does not consist in the abundance of possessions.\u201d ","Then he told them a parable: \u201cThe land of a rich man produced abundantly.","And he thought to himself
 \u2018What should I do
 for I have no place to store my crops?\u2019 ","Then he said
 \u2018I will do this: I will pull down my barns and build larger ones
 and there I will store all my grain and my goods. ","And I will say to my soul
 Soul
 you have ample goods laid up for many years; relax
 eat
 drink
 be merry.\u2019 ","But God said to him
 \u2018You fool! This very night your life is being demanded of you. And the things you have prepared
 whose will they be?\u2019 ","So it is with those who store up treasures for themselves but are not rich toward God.\u201d","He said to his disciples
 \u201cTherefore I tell you
 do not worry about your life
 what you will eat
 or about your body
 what you will wear. ","For life is more than food
 and the body more than clothing. ","Consider the ravens: they neither sow nor reap
 they have neither storehouse nor barn
 and yet God feeds them. Of how much more value are you than the birds! ","And can any of you by worrying add a single hour to your span of life?","If then you are not able to do so small a thing as that
 why do you worry about the rest? ","Consider the lilies
 how they grow: they neither toil nor spin; yet I tell you
 even Solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these. ","But if God so clothes the grass of the field
 which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven
 how much more will he clothe you\u2014you of little faith! ","And do not keep striving for what you are to eat and what you are to drink
 and do not keep worrying. ","For it is the nations of the world that strive after all these things
 and your Father knows that you need them. ","Instead
 strive for his kingdom
 and these things will be given to you as well.","\u201cDo not be afraid
 little flock
 for it is your Father\u2019s good pleasure to give you the kingdom. ","Sell your possessions
 and give alms. Make purses for yourselves that do not wear out
 an unfailing treasure in heaven
 where no thief comes near and no moth destroys. ","For where your treasure is
 there your heart will be also.","\u201cBe dressed for action and have your lamps lit;","be like those who are waiting for their master to return from the wedding banquet
 so that they may open the door for him as soon as he comes and knocks. ","Blessed are those slaves whom the master finds alert when he comes; truly I tell you
 he will fasten his belt and have them sit down to eat
 and he will come and serve them. ","If he comes during the middle of the night
 or near dawn
 and finds them so
 blessed are those slaves.","\u201cBut know this: if the owner of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming
 he would not have let his house be broken into. ","You also must be ready
 for the Son of Man is coming at an unexpected hour.\u201d","And the Lord said
 \u201cWho then is the faithful and prudent manager whom his master will put in charge of his slaves
 to give them their allowance of food at the proper time? ","Blessed is that slave whom his master will find at work when he arrives.","Truly I tell you
 he will put that one in charge of all his possessions. ","But if that slave says to himself
 \u2018My master is delayed in coming
\u2019 and if he begins to beat the other slaves
 men and women
 and to eat and drink and get drunk
 ","the master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour that he does not know
 and will cut him in pieces
 and put him with the unfaithful. ","That slave who knew what his master wanted
 but did not prepare himself or do what was wanted
 will receive a severe beating. ","But the one who did not know and did what deserved a beating will receive a light beating. From everyone to whom much has been given
 much will be required; and from the one to whom much has been entrusted
 even more will be demanded.","\u201cI came to bring fire to the earth
 and how I wish it were already kindled! ","I have a baptism with which to be baptized
 and what stress I am under until it is completed! ","Do you think that I have come to bring peace to the earth? No
 I tell you
 but rather division! ","From now on five in one household will be divided
 three against two and two against three; ","they will be divided: father against son and son against father
 mother against daughter and daughter against mother
 mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.\u201d","He also said to the crowds
 \u201cWhen you see a cloud rising in the west
 you immediately say
 \u2018It is going to rain\u2019; and so it happens. ","And when you see the south wind blowing
 you say
 \u2018There will be scorching heat\u2019; and it happens. ","You hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of earth and sky
 but why do you not know how to interpret the present time?","\u201cAnd why do you not judge for yourselves what is right?","Thus
 when you go with your accuser before a magistrate
 on the way make an effort to settle the case
 or you may be dragged before the judge
 and the judge hand you over to the officer
 and the officer throw you in prison. ","I tell you
 you will never get out until you have paid the very last penny.\u201d","He asked them
 \u201cDo you think that because these Galileans suffered in this way they were worse sinners than all other Galileans? ","No
 I tell you; but unless you repent
 you will all perish as they did. ","Or those eighteen who were killed when the tower of Siloam fell on them\u2014do you think that they were worse offenders than all the others living in Jerusalem?","No
 I tell you; but unless you repent
 you will all perish just as they did.\u201d","Then he told this parable: \u201cA man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came looking for fruit on it and found none.","So he said to the gardener
 \u2018See here! For three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree
 and still I find none. Cut it down! Why should it be wasting the soil?\u2019 ","He replied
 \u2018Sir
 let it alone for one more year
 until I dig around it and put manure on it. ","If it bears fruit next year
 well and good; but if not
 you can cut it down.\u2019\u201d","When Jesus saw her
 he called her over and said
 \u201cWoman
 you are set free from your ailment.\u201d ","But the Lord answered him and said
 \u201cYou hypocrites! Does not each of you on the sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from the manger
 and lead it away to give it water? ","And ought not this woman
 a daughter of Abraham whom Satan bound for eighteen long years
 be set free from this bondage on the sabbath day?\u201d ","He said therefore
 \u201cWhat is the kingdom of God like? And to what should I compare it? ","It is like a mustard seed that someone took and sowed in the garden; it grew and became a tree
 and the birds of the air made nests in its branches.\u201d","And again he said
 \u201cTo what should I compare the kingdom of God? ","It is like yeast that a woman took and mixed in with three measures of flour until all of it was leavened.\u201d","Someone asked him
 \u201cLord
 will only a few be saved?\u201d He said to them
 ","\u201cStrive to enter through the narrow door; for many
 I tell you
 will try to enter and will not be able. ","When once the owner of the house has got up and shut the door
 and you begin to stand outside and to knock at the door
 saying
 \u2018Lord
 open to us
\u2019 then in reply he will say to you
 \u2018I do not know where you come from.\u2019 ","Then you will begin to say
 \u2018We ate and drank with you
 and you taught in our streets.\u2019 ","But he will say
 \u2018I do not know where you come from; go away from me
 all you evildoers!\u2019 ","There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God
 and you yourselves thrown out. ","Then people will come from east and west
 from north and south
 and will eat in the kingdom of God. ","Indeed
 some are last who will be first
 and some are first who will be last.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cGo and tell that fox for me
 \u2018Listen
 I am casting out demons and performing cures today and tomorrow

 tomorrow

 because it is impossible for a prophet to be killed outside of Jerusalem.\u2019 ","Jerusalem
 Jerusalem
 the city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it! How often have I desired to gather your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings
 and you were not willing! ","See
 your house is left to you. And I tell you
 you will not see me until the time comes when you say
 \u2018Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord.\u2019\u201d","And Jesus asked the lawyers and Pharisees
 \u201cIs it lawful to cure people on the sabbath
 or not?\u201d ","Then he said to them
 \u201cIf one of you has a child or an ox that has fallen into a well
 will you not immediately pull it out on a sabbath day?\u201d ","\u201cWhen you are invited by someone to a wedding banquet
 do not sit down at the place of honor
 in case someone more distinguished than you has been invited by your host; ","and the host who invited both of you may come and say to you
 \u2018Give this person your place
\u2019 and then in disgrace you would start to take the lowest place. ","But when you are invited
 go and sit down at the lowest place
 so that when your host comes
 he may say to you
 \u2018Friend
 move up higher\u2019; then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at the table with you. ","For all who exalt themselves will be humbled
 and those who humble themselves will be exalted.\u201d","He said also to the one who had invited him
 \u201cWhen you give a luncheon or a dinner
 do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors
 in case they may invite you in return
 and you would be repaid. ","But when you give a banquet
 invite the poor
 the crippled
 the lame
 and the blind. ","And you will be blessed
 because they cannot repay you
 for you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.\u201d","One of the dinner guests
 on hearing this
 said to him
 \u201cBlessed is anyone who will eat bread in the kingdom of God!\u201d ","Then Jesus said to him
 \u201cSomeone gave a great dinner and invited many. ","At the time for the dinner he sent his slave to say to those who had been invited
 \u2018Come; for everything is ready now.\u2019 ","But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said to him
 \u2018I have bought a piece of land
 and I must go out and see it; please accept my regrets.\u2019 ","Another said
 \u2018I have bought five yoke of oxen
 and I am going to try them out; please accept my regrets.\u2019 ","Another said
 \u2018I have just been married
 and therefore I cannot come.\u2019 ","So the slave returned and reported this to his master. Then the owner of the house became angry and said to his slave
 \u2018Go out at once into the streets and lanes of the town and bring in the poor
 the crippled
 the blind
 and the lame.\u2019 ","And the slave said
 \u2018Sir
 what you ordered has been done
 and there is still room.\u2019 ","Then the master said to the slave
 \u2018Go out into the roads and lanes
 and compel people to come in
 so that my house may be filled. ","For I tell you
 none of those who were invited will taste my dinner.\u2019\u201d","Now large crowds were traveling with him; and he turned and said to them
 ","\u201cWhoever comes to me and does not hate father and mother
 wife and children
 brothers and sisters
 yes
 and even life itself
 cannot be my disciple. ","Whoever does not carry the cross and follow me cannot be my disciple.","For which of you
 intending to build a tower
 does not first sit down and estimate the cost
 to see whether he has enough to complete it? ","Otherwise
 when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish
 all who see it will begin to ridicule him
 ","saying
 \u2018This fellow began to build and was not able to finish.\u2019 ","Or what king
 going out to wage war against another king
 will not sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to oppose the one who comes against him with twenty thousand? ","If he cannot
 then
 while the other is still far away
 he sends a delegation and asks for the terms of peace. ","So therefore
 none of you can become my disciple if you do not give up all your possessions.","\u201cSalt is good; but if salt has lost its taste
 how can its saltiness be restored? ","It is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile; they throw it away. Let anyone with ears to hear listen!\u201d","\u201cWhich one of you
 having a hundred sheep and losing one of them
 does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go after the one that is lost until he finds it? ","When he has found it
 he lays it on his shoulders and rejoices. ","And when he comes home
 he calls together his friends and neighbors
 saying to them
 \u2018Rejoice with me
 for I have found my sheep that was lost.\u2019 ","Just so
 I tell you
 there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance.","\u201cOr what woman having ten silver coins
 if she loses one of them
 does not light a lamp
 sweep the house
 and search carefully until she finds it? ","When she has found it
 she calls together her friends and neighbors
 saying
 \u2018Rejoice with me
 for I have found the coin that I had lost.\u2019 ","Just so
 I tell you
 there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.\u201d","Then Jesus said
 \u201cThere was a man who had two sons. ","The younger of them said to his father
 \u2018Father
 give me the share of the property that will belong to me.\u2019 So he divided his property between them. ","A few days later the younger son gathered all he had and traveled to a distant country
 and there he squandered his property in dissolute living. ","When he had spent everything
 a severe famine took place throughout that country
 and he began to be in need. ","So he went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country
 who sent him to his fields to feed the pigs. ","He would gladly have filled himself with the pods that the pigs were eating; and no one gave him anything.","But when he came to himself he said
 \u2018How many of my father\u2019s hired hands have bread enough and to spare
 but here I am dying of hunger! ","I will get up and go to my father
 and I will say to him
 \u201cFather
 I have sinned against heaven and before you; ","I am no longer worthy to be called your son; treat me like one of your hired hands.\u201d\u2019","So he set off and went to his father. But while he was still far off
 his father saw him and was filled with compassion; he ran and put his arms around him and kissed him. ","Then the son said to him
 \u2018Father
 I have sinned against heaven and before you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son.\u2019 ","But the father said to his slaves
 \u2018Quickly
 bring out a robe\u2014the best one\u2014and put it on him; put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. ","And get the fatted calf and kill it
 and let us eat and celebrate; ","for this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found!\u2019 And they began to celebrate.","\u201cNow his elder son was in the field; and when he came and approached the house
 he heard music and dancing. ","He called one of the slaves and asked what was going on.","He replied
 \u2018Your brother has come
 and your father has killed the fatted calf
 because he has got him back safe and sound.\u2019 ","Then he became angry and refused to go in. His father came out and began to plead with him.","But he answered his father
 \u2018Listen! For all these years I have been working like a slave for you
 and I have never disobeyed your command; yet you have never given me even a young goat so that I might celebrate with my friends. ","But when this son of yours came back
 who has devoured your property with prostitutes
 you killed the fatted calf for him!\u2019 ","Then the father said to him
 \u2018Son
 you are always with me
 and all that is mine is yours. ","But we had to celebrate and rejoice
 because this brother of yours was dead and has come to life; he was lost and has been found.\u2019\u201d","Then Jesus said to the disciples
 \u201cThere was a rich man who had a manager
 and charges were brought to him that this man was squandering his property. ","So he summoned him and said to him
 \u2018What is this that I hear about you? Give me an accounting of your management
 because you cannot be my manager any longer.\u2019 ","Then the manager said to himself
 \u2018What will I do
 now that my master is taking the position away from me? I am not strong enough to dig
 and I am ashamed to beg. ","I have decided what to do so that
 when I am dismissed as manager
 people may welcome me into their homes.\u2019 ","So
 summoning his master\u2019s debtors one by one
 he asked the first
 \u2018How much do you owe my master?\u2019 ","He answered
 \u2018A hundred jugs of olive oil.\u2019 He said to him
 \u2018Take your bill
 sit down quickly
 and make it fifty.\u2019 ","Then he asked another
 \u2018And how much do you owe?\u2019 He replied
 \u2018A hundred containers of wheat.\u2019 He said to him
 \u2018Take your bill and make it eighty.\u2019 ","And his master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly; for the children of this age are more shrewd in dealing with their own generation than are the children of light.","And I tell you
 make friends for yourselves by means of dishonest wealth so that when it is gone
 they may welcome you into the eternal homes.","\u201cWhoever is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much; and whoever is dishonest in a very little is dishonest also in much.","If then you have not been faithful with the dishonest wealth
 who will entrust to you the true riches? ","And if you have not been faithful with what belongs to another
 who will give you what is your own? ","No slave can serve two masters; for a slave will either hate the one and love the other
 or be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth.\u201d","So he said to them
 \u201cYou are those who justify yourselves in the sight of others; but God knows your hearts; for what is prized by human beings is an abomination in the sight of God.","\u201cThe law and the prophets were in effect until John came; since then the good news of the kingdom of God is proclaimed
 and everyone tries to enter it by force. ","But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away
 than for one stroke of a letter in the law to be dropped.","\u201cAnyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery
 and whoever marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery.","\u201cThere was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and who feasted sumptuously every day.","And at his gate lay a poor man named Lazarus
 covered with sores
 ","who longed to satisfy his hunger with what fell from the rich man\u2019s table; even the dogs would come and lick his sores.","The poor man died and was carried away by the angels to be with Abraham. The rich man also died and was buried.","In Hades
 where he was being tormented
 he looked up and saw Abraham far away with Lazarus by his side. ","He called out
 \u2018Father Abraham
 have mercy on me
 and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue; for I am in agony in these flames.\u2019 ","But Abraham said
 \u2018Child
 remember that during your lifetime you received your good things
 and Lazarus in like manner evil things; but now he is comforted here
 and you are in agony. ","Besides all this
 between you and us a great chasm has been fixed
 so that those who might want to pass from here to you cannot do so
 and no one can cross from there to us.\u2019 ","He said
 \u2018Then
 father
 I beg you to send him to my father\u2019s house\u2014 ","for I have five brothers\u2014that he may warn them
 so that they will not also come into this place of torment.\u2019 ","Abraham replied
 \u2018They have Moses and the prophets; they should listen to them.\u2019 ","He said
 \u2018No
 father Abraham; but if someone goes to them from the dead
 they will repent.\u2019 ","He said to him
 \u2018If they do not listen to Moses and the prophets
 neither will they be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.\u2019\u201d","Jesus said to his disciples
 \u201cOccasions for stumbling are bound to come
 but woe to anyone by whom they come! ","It would be better for you if a millstone were hung around your neck and you were thrown into the sea than for you to cause one of these little ones to stumble.","Be on your guard! If another disciple sins
 you must rebuke the offender
 and if there is repentance
 you must forgive. ","And if the same person sins against you seven times a day
 and turns back to you seven times and says
 \u2018I repent
\u2019 you must forgive.\u201d","The Lord replied
 \u201cIf you had faith the size of a mustard seed
 you could say to this mulberry tree
 \u2018Be uprooted and planted in the sea
\u2019 and it would obey you.","\u201cWho among you would say to your slave who has just come in from plowing or tending sheep in the field
 \u2018Come here at once and take your place at the table\u2019? ","Would you not rather say to him
 \u2018Prepare supper for me
 put on your apron and serve me while I eat and drink; later you may eat and drink\u2019? ","Do you thank the slave for doing what was commanded?","So you also
 when you have done all that you were ordered to do
 say
 \u2018We are worthless slaves; we have done only what we ought to have done!\u2019\u201d","On the way to Jerusalem Jesus was going through the region between Samaria and Galilee.","When he saw them
 he said to them
 \u201cGo and show yourselves to the priests.\u201d And as they went
 they were made clean. ","Then Jesus asked
 \u201cWere not ten made clean? But the other nine
 where are they? ","Was none of them found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?\u201d","Then he said to him
 \u201cGet up and go on your way; your faith has made you well.\u201d","Once Jesus was asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God was coming
 and he answered
 \u201cThe kingdom of God is not coming with things that can be observed; ","nor will they say
 \u2018Look
 here it is!\u2019 or \u2018There it is!\u2019 For
 in fact
 the kingdom of God is among you.\u201d","Then he said to the disciples
 \u201cThe days are coming when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man
 and you will not see it. ","They will say to you
 \u2018Look there!\u2019 or \u2018Look here!\u2019 Do not go
 do not set off in pursuit. ","For as the lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one side to the other
 so will the Son of Man be in his day. ","But first he must endure much suffering and be rejected by this generation.","Just as it was in the days of Noah
 so too it will be in the days of the Son of Man. ","They were eating and drinking
 and marrying and being given in marriage
 until the day Noah entered the ark
 and the flood came and destroyed all of them. ","Likewise
 just as it was in the days of Lot: they were eating and drinking
 buying and selling
 planting and building
 ","but on the day that Lot left Sodom
 it rained fire and sulfur from heaven and destroyed all of them ","\u2014it will be like that on the day that the Son of Man is revealed.","On that day
 anyone on the housetop who has belongings in the house must not come down to take them away; and likewise anyone in the field must not turn back. ","Remember Lot\u2019s wife.","Those who try to make their life secure will lose it
 but those who lose their life will keep it. ","I tell you
 on that night there will be two in one bed; one will be taken and the other left. ","There will be two women grinding meal together; one will be taken and the other left.\u201d","Then they asked him
 \u201cWhere
 Lord?\u201d He said to them
 \u201cWhere the corpse is
 there the vultures will gather.\u201d","He said
 \u201cIn a certain city there was a judge who neither feared God nor had respect for people. ","In that city there was a widow who kept coming to him and saying
 \u2018Grant me justice against my opponent.\u2019 ","For a while he refused; but later he said to himself
 \u2018Though I have no fear of God and no respect for anyone
 ","yet because this widow keeps bothering me
 I will grant her justice
 so that she may not wear me out by continually coming.\u2019\u201d ","And the Lord said
 \u201cListen to what the unjust judge says. ","And will not God grant justice to his chosen ones who cry to him day and night? Will he delay long in helping them?","I tell you
 he will quickly grant justice to them. And yet
 when the Son of Man comes
 will he find faith on earth?\u201d","\u201cTwo men went up to the temple to pray
 one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. ","The Pharisee
 standing by himself
 was praying thus
 \u2018God
 I thank you that I am not like other people: thieves
 rogues
 adulterers
 or even like this tax collector. ","I fast twice a week; I give a tenth of all my income.\u2019","But the tax collector
 standing far off
 would not even look up to heaven
 but was beating his breast and saying
 \u2018God
 be merciful to me
 a sinner!\u2019 ","I tell you
 this man went down to his home justified rather than the other; for all who exalt themselves will be humbled
 but all who humble themselves will be exalted.\u201d","But Jesus called for them and said
 \u201cLet the little children come to me
 and do not stop them; for it is to such as these that the kingdom of God belongs. ","Truly I tell you
 whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will never enter it.\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cWhy do you call me good? No one is good but God alone. ","You know the commandments: \u2018You shall not commit adultery; You shall not murder; You shall not steal; You shall not bear false witness; Honor your father and mother.\u2019\u201d","He replied
 \u201cI have kept all these since my youth.\u201d ","When Jesus heard this
 he said to him
 \u201cThere is still one thing lacking. Sell all that you own and distribute the money to the poor
 and you will have treasure in heaven; then come
 follow me.\u201d ","Jesus looked at him and said
 \u201cHow hard it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God! ","Indeed
 it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.\u201d","He replied
 \u201cWhat is impossible for mortals is possible for God.\u201d","And he said to them
 \u201cTruly I tell you
 there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children
 for the sake of the kingdom of God
 ","who will not get back very much more in this age
 and in the age to come eternal life.\u201d","Then he took the twelve aside and said to them
 \u201cSee
 we are going up to Jerusalem
 and everything that is written about the Son of Man by the prophets will be accomplished. ","For he will be handed over to the Gentiles; and he will be mocked and insulted and spat upon.","After they have flogged him
 they will kill him
 and on the third day he will rise again.\u201d ","But they understood nothing about all these things; in fact
 what he said was hidden from them
 and they did not grasp what was said.","\u201cWhat do you want me to do for you?\u201d He said
 \u201cLord
 let me see again.\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cReceive your sight; your faith has saved you.\u201d ","When Jesus came to the place
 he looked up and said to him
 \u201cZacchaeus
 hurry and come down; for I must stay at your house today.\u201d ","Zacchaeus stood there and said to the Lord
 \u201cLook
 half of my possessions
 Lord
 I will give to the poor; and if I have defrauded anyone of anything
 I will pay back four times as much.\u201d ","Then Jesus said to him
 \u201cToday salvation has come to this house
 because he too is a son of Abraham. ","For the Son of Man came to seek out and to save the lost.\u201d","So he said
 \u201cA nobleman went to a distant country to get royal power for himself and then return. ","He summoned ten of his slaves
 and gave them ten pounds
 and said to them
 \u2018Do business with these until I come back.\u2019 ","But the citizens of his country hated him and sent a delegation after him
 saying
 \u2018We do not want this man to rule over us.\u2019 ","When he returned
 having received royal power
 he ordered these slaves
 to whom he had given the money
 to be summoned so that he might find out what they had gained by trading. ","The first came forward and said
 \u2018Lord
 your pound has made ten more pounds.\u2019 ","He said to him
 \u2018Well done
 good slave! Because you have been trustworthy in a very small thing
 take charge of ten cities.\u2019 ","Then the second came
 saying
 \u2018Lord
 your pound has made five pounds.\u2019 ","He said to him
 \u2018And you
 rule over five cities.\u2019 ","Then the other came
 saying
 \u2018Lord
 here is your pound. I wrapped it up in a piece of cloth
 ","for I was afraid of you
 because you are a harsh man; you take what you did not deposit
 and reap what you did not sow.\u2019 ","He said to him
 \u2018I will judge you by your own words
 you wicked slave! You knew
 did you
 that I was a harsh man
 taking what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not sow? ","Why then did you not put my money into the bank? Then when I returned
 I could have collected it with interest.\u2019 ","He said to the bystanders
 \u2018Take the pound from him and give it to the one who has ten pounds.\u2019 ","(And they said to him
 \u2018Lord
 he has ten pounds!\u2019) ","\u2018I tell you
 to all those who have
 more will be given; but from those who have nothing

 \u201cGo into the village ahead of you
 and as you enter it you will find tied there a colt that has never been ridden. Untie it and bring it here. ","If anyone asks you
 \u2018Why are you untying it?\u2019 just say this
 \u2018The Lord needs it.\u2019\u201d ","Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him
 \u201cTeacher

 \u201cI tell you

 \u201cIf you
 even you
 had only recognized on this day the things that make for peace! But now they are hidden from your eyes. ","Indeed
 the days will come upon you
 when your enemies will set up ramparts around you and surround you
 and hem you in on every side. ","They will crush you to the ground
 you and your children within you

 \u201cIt is written
 \u2018My house shall be a house of prayer\u2019; but you have made it a den of robbers.\u201d","He answered them
 \u201cI will also ask you a question
 and you tell me: ","Did the baptism of John come from heaven

 \u201cNeither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.\u201d","He began to tell the people this parable: \u201cA man planted a vineyard
 and leased it to tenants
 and went to another country for a long time. ","When the season came
 he sent a slave to the tenants in order that they might give him his share of the produce of the vineyard; but the tenants beat him and sent him away empty-handed. ","Next he sent another slave; that one also they beat and insulted and sent away empty-handed.","And he sent still a third; this one also they wounded and threw out.","Then the owner of the vineyard said
 \u2018What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; perhaps they will respect him.\u2019 ","But when the tenants saw him
 they discussed it among themselves and said
 \u2018This is the heir; let us kill him so that the inheritance may be ours.\u2019 ","So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?","He will come and destroy those tenants and give the vineyard to others.\u201d When they heard this
 they said
 \u201cHeaven forbid!\u201d ","But he looked at them and said
 \u201cWhat then does this text mean: \u2018The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone\u2019?","Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces; and it will crush anyone on whom it falls.\u201d","So they watched him and sent spies who pretended to be honest
 in order to trap him by what he said

 they became silent.","Jesus said to them
 \u201cThose who belong to this age marry and are given in marriage; ","but those who are considered worthy of a place in that age and in the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage.","Indeed they cannot die anymore

 in the story about the bush

 \u2018I am he!\u2019 and
 \u2018The time is near!\u2019 Do not go after them.","\u201cWhen you hear of wars and insurrections
 do not be terrified; for these things must take place first
 but the end will not follow immediately.\u201d ","Then he said to them
 \u201cNation will rise against nation
 and kingdom against kingdom; ","there will be great earthquakes
 and in various places famines and plagues; and there will be dreadful portents and great signs from heaven.","\u201cBut before all this occurs
 they will arrest you and persecute you; they will hand you over to synagogues and prisons
 and you will be brought before kings and governors because of my name. ","This will give you an opportunity to testify.","So make up your minds not to prepare your defense in advance;","for I will give you words and a wisdom that none of your opponents will be able to withstand or contradict.","You will be betrayed even by parents and brothers
 by relatives and friends; and they will put some of you to death. ","You will be hated by all because of my name.","But not a hair of your head will perish.","By your endurance you will gain your souls.","\u201cWhen you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies
 then know that its desolation has come near. ","Then those in Judea must flee to the mountains
 and those inside the city must leave it
 and those out in the country must not enter it; ","for these are days of vengeance
 as a fulfillment of all that is written. ","Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing infants in those days! For there will be great distress on the earth and wrath against this people;","they will fall by the edge of the sword and be taken away as captives among all nations; and Jerusalem will be trampled on by the Gentiles
 until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.","\u201cThere will be signs in the sun
 the moon
 and the stars
 and on the earth distress among nations confused by the roaring of the sea and the waves. ","People will faint from fear and foreboding of what is coming upon the world
 for the powers of the heavens will be shaken. ","Then they will see \u2018the Son of Man coming in a cloud\u2019 with power and great glory.","Now when these things begin to take place
 stand up and raise your heads
 because your redemption is drawing near.\u201d","Then he told them a parable: \u201cLook at the fig tree and all the trees;","as soon as they sprout leaves you can see for yourselves and know that summer is already near.","So also
 when you see these things taking place
 you know that the kingdom of God is near. ","Truly I tell you
 this generation will not pass away until all things have taken place. ","Heaven and earth will pass away
 but my words will not pass away.","\u201cBe on guard so that your hearts are not weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and the worries of this life
 and that day does not catch you unexpectedly
 ","like a trap. For it will come upon all who live on the face of the whole earth.","Be alert at all times
 praying that you may have the strength to escape all these things that will take place
 and to stand before the Son of Man.\u201d","So Jesus sent Peter and John
 saying
 \u201cGo and prepare the Passover meal for us that we may eat it.\u201d ","\u201cListen
\u201d he said to them
 \u201cwhen you have entered the city
 a man carrying a jar of water will meet you; follow him into the house he enters ","and say to the owner of the house
 \u2018The teacher asks you
 \u201cWhere is the guest room
 where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?\u201d\u2019 ","He will show you a large room upstairs
 already furnished. Make preparations for us there.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cI have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer; ","for I tell you
 I will not eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.\u201d ","Then he took a cup
 and after giving thanks he said
 \u201cTake this and divide it among yourselves; ","for I tell you that from now on I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.\u201d","Then he took a loaf of bread
 and when he had given thanks
 he broke it and gave it to them
 saying
 \u201cThis is my body
 which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me.\u201d ","And he did the same with the cup after supper
 saying
 \u201cThis cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood. ","But see
 the one who betrays me is with me
 and his hand is on the table. ","For the Son of Man is going as it has been determined
 but woe to that one by whom he is betrayed!\u201d ","But he said to them
 \u201cThe kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and those in authority over them are called benefactors. ","But not so with you; rather the greatest among you must become like the youngest
 and the leader like one who serves. ","For who is greater
 the one who is at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one at the table? But I am among you as one who serves.","\u201cYou are those who have stood by me in my trials;","and I confer on you
 just as my Father has conferred on me
 a kingdom
 ","so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom
 and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.","\u201cSimon
 Simon
 listen! Satan has demanded to sift all of you like wheat
 ","but I have prayed for you that your own faith may not fail; and you
 when once you have turned back
 strengthen your brothers.\u201d ","And he said to him
 \u201cLord
 I am ready to go with you to prison and to death!\u201d ","Jesus said
 \u201cI tell you
 Peter
 the cock will not crow this day
 until you have denied three times that you know me.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cWhen I sent you out without a purse
 bag
 or sandals
 did you lack anything?\u201d They said
 \u201cNo
 not a thing.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cBut now
 the one who has a purse must take it
 and likewise a bag. And the one who has no sword must sell his cloak and buy one. ","For I tell you
 this scripture must be fulfilled in me
 \u2018And he was counted among the lawless\u2019; and indeed what is written about me is being fulfilled.\u201d ","They said
 \u201cLord
 look
 here are two swords.\u201d He replied
 \u201cIt is enough.\u201d","When he reached the place
 he said to them
 \u201cPray that you may not come into the time of trial.\u201d ","\u201cFather
 if you are willing
 remove this cup from me; yet
 not my will but yours be done.\u201d ","and he said to them
 \u201cWhy are you sleeping? Get up and pray that you may not come into the time of trial.\u201d","but Jesus said to him
 \u201cJudas
 is it with a kiss that you are betraying the Son of Man?\u201d ","But Jesus said
 \u201cNo more of this!\u201d And he touched his ear and healed him. ","Then Jesus said to the chief priests
 the officers of the temple police
 and the elders who had come for him
 \u201cHave you come out with swords and clubs as if I were a bandit? ","When I was with you day after day in the temple
 you did not lay hands on me. But this is your hour
 and the power of darkness!\u201d","The Lord turned and looked at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word of the Lord
 how he had said to him
 \u201cBefore the cock crows today
 you will deny me three times.\u201d ","They said
 \u201cIf you are the Messiah
 tell us.\u201d He replied
 \u201cIf I tell you
 you will not believe; ","and if I question you
 you will not answer. ","But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.\u201d","All of them asked
 \u201cAre you
 then
 the Son of God?\u201d He said to them
 \u201cYou say that I am.\u201d ","Then Pilate asked him
 \u201cAre you the king of the Jews?\u201d He answered
 \u201cYou say so.\u201d ","When Pilate heard this
 he asked whether the man was a Galilean. ","and said to them
 \u201cYou brought me this man as one who was perverting the people; and here I have examined him in your presence and have not found this man guilty of any of your charges against him. ","A third time he said to them
 \u201cWhy
 what evil has he done? I have found in him no ground for the sentence of death; I will therefore have him flogged and then release him.\u201d ","But Jesus turned to them and said
 \u201cDaughters of Jerusalem
 do not weep for me
 but weep for yourselves and for your children. ","For the days are surely coming when they will say
 \u2018Blessed are the barren
 and the wombs that never bore
 and the breasts that never nursed.\u2019 ","Then they will begin to say to the mountains
 \u2018Fall on us\u2019; and to the hills
 \u2018Cover us.\u2019 ","For if they do this when the wood is green
 what will happen when it is dry?\u201d","Then Jesus said
 \u201cFather
 forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing.\u201d]] And they cast lots to divide his clothing. ","He replied
 \u201cTruly I tell you
 today you will be with me in Paradise.\u201d","Then Jesus
 crying with a loud voice
 said
 \u201cFather
 into your hands I commend my spirit.\u201d Having said this
 he breathed his last. ","The women were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground
 but the men said to them
 \u201cWhy do you look for the living among the dead? He is not here
 but has risen. ","And he said to them
 \u201cWhat are you discussing with each other while you walk along?\u201d They stood still
 looking sad. ","He asked them
 \u201cWhat things?\u201d They replied
 \u201cThe things about Jesus of Nazareth
 who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people
 ","Then he said to them
 \u201cOh
 how foolish you are
 and how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have declared! ","Was it not necessary that the Messiah should suffer these things and then enter into his glory?\u201d","While they were talking about this
 Jesus himself stood among them and said to them
 \u201cPeace be with you.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cWhy are you frightened
 and why do doubts arise in your hearts? ","Look at my hands and my feet; see that it is I myself. Touch me and see; for a ghost does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have.\u201d","While in their joy they were disbelieving and still wondering
 he said to them
 \u201cHave you anything here to eat?\u201d ","Then he said to them
 \u201cThese are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you\u2014that everything written about me in the law of Moses
 the prophets
 and the psalms must be fulfilled.\u201d ","and he said to them
 \u201cThus it is written
 that the Messiah is to suffer and to rise from the dead on the third day
 ","and that repentance and forgiveness of sins is to be proclaimed in his name to all nations
 beginning from Jerusalem. ","You are witnesses of these things.","And see
 I am sending upon you what my Father promised; so stay here in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cWhy were you searching for me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father\u2019s house?\u201d ","Jesus answered him
 \u201cIt is written
 \u2018One does not live by bread alone.\u2019\u201d","And the devil said to him
 \u201cTo you I will give their glory and all this authority; for it has been given over to me
 and I give it to anyone I please. ","Jesus answered him
 \u201cIt is written
 \u2018Worship the Lord your God
 and serve only him.\u2019\u201d","Then the devil took him to Jerusalem
 and placed him on the pinnacle of the temple
 saying to him
 \u201cIf you are the Son of God
 throw yourself down from here
 ","Jesus answered him
 \u201cIt is said
 \u2018Do not put the Lord your God to the test.\u2019\u201d ","\u201cThe Spirit of the Lord is upon me
 because he has anointed me to bring good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind
 to let the oppressed go free
","to proclaim the year of the Lord\u2019s favor.\u201d","Then he began to say to them
 \u201cToday this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cDoubtless you will quote to me this proverb
 \u2018Doctor
 cure yourself!\u2019 And you will say
 \u2018Do here also in your hometown the things that we have heard you did at Capernaum.\u2019\u201d ","And he said
 \u201cTruly I tell you
 no prophet is accepted in the prophet\u2019s hometown. ","But the truth is
 there were many widows in Israel in the time of Elijah
 when the heaven was shut up three years and six months
 and there was a severe famine over all the land; ","yet Elijah was sent to none of them except to a widow at Zarephath in Sidon.","There were also many lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha
 and none of them was cleansed except Naaman the Syrian.\u201d ","They were astounded at his teaching
 because he spoke with authority. ","But Jesus rebuked him
 saying
 \u201cBe silent
 and come out of him!\u201d When the demon had thrown him down before them
 he came out of him without having done him any harm. ","Demons also came out of many
 shouting
 \u201cYou are the Son of God!\u201d But he rebuked them and would not allow them to speak
 because they knew that he was the Messiah.","But he said to them
 \u201cI must proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God to the other cities also; for I was sent for this purpose.\u201d ","When he had finished speaking
 he said to Simon
 \u201cPut out into the deep water and let down your nets for a catch.\u201d ","and so also were James and John
 sons of Zebedee
 who were partners with Simon. Then Jesus said to Simon
 \u201cDo not be afraid; from now on you will be catching people.\u201d ","Then Jesus stretched out his hand
 touched him
 and said
 \u201cI do choose. Be made clean.\u201d Immediately the leprosy left him. ","And he ordered him to tell no one. \u201cGo
\u201d he said
 \u201cand show yourself to the priest
 and
 as Moses commanded
 make an offering for your cleansing
 for a testimony to them.\u201d ","When he saw their faith
 he said
 \u201cFriend
 your sins are forgiven you.\u201d ","When Jesus perceived their questionings
 he answered them
 \u201cWhy do you raise such questions in your hearts? ","Which is easier
 to say
 \u2018Your sins are forgiven you
\u2019 or to say
 \u2018Stand up and walk\u2019? ","But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins\u201d\u2014he said to the one who was paralyzed\u2014\u201cI say to you
 stand up and take your bed and go to your home.\u201d ","After this he went out and saw a tax collector named Levi
 sitting at the tax booth; and he said to him
 \u201cFollow me.\u201d ","Jesus answered
 \u201cThose who are well have no need of a physician
 but those who are sick; ","I have come to call not the righteous but sinners to repentance.\u201d","Then they said to him
 \u201cJohn\u2019s disciples
 like the disciples of the Pharisees
 frequently fast and pray
 but your disciples eat and drink.\u201d ","Jesus said to them
 \u201cYou cannot make wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them
 can you? ","The days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them
 and then they will fast in those days.\u201d ","He also told them a parable: \u201cNo one tears a piece from a new garment and sews it on an old garment; otherwise the new will be torn
 and the piece from the new will not match the old. ","And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; otherwise the new wine will burst the skins and will be spilled
 and the skins will be destroyed. ","But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins.","And no one after drinking old wine desires new wine
 but says
 \u2018The old is good.\u2019\u201d","Jesus answered
 \u201cHave you not read what David did when he and his companions were hungry? ","He entered the house of God and took and ate the bread of the Presence
 which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat
 and gave some to his companions?\u201d ","Then he said to them
 \u201cThe Son of Man is lord of the sabbath.\u201d","Even though he knew what they were thinking
 he said to the man who had the withered hand
 \u201cCome and stand here.\u201d He got up and stood there. ","Then Jesus said to them
 \u201cI ask you
 is it lawful to do good or to do harm on the sabbath
 to save life or to destroy it?\u201d ","After looking around at all of them
 he said to him
 \u201cStretch out your hand.\u201d He did so
 and his hand was restored. ","\u201cBlessed are you who are hungry now

 and when they exclude you
 revile you
 and defame you on account of the Son of Man. ","Rejoice in that day and leap for joy
 for surely your reward is great in heaven; for that is what their ancestors did to the prophets.","\u201cBut woe to you who are rich
 for you have received your consolation.","\u201cWoe to you who are full now
 for you will be hungry. \u201cWoe to you who are laughing now

 Love your enemies
 do good to those who hate you
 ","bless those who curse you
 pray for those who abuse you. ","If anyone strikes you on the cheek
 offer the other also; and from anyone who takes away your coat do not withhold even your shirt. ","Give to everyone who begs from you; and if anyone takes away your goods
 do not ask for them again. ","Do to others as you would have them do to you.","\u201cIf you love those who love you
 what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them. ","If you do good to those who do good to you
 what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same. ","If you lend to those from whom you hope to receive
 what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners
 to receive as much again. ","But love your enemies
 do good
 and lend
 expecting nothing in return. Your reward will be great

 just as your Father is merciful.","\u201cDo not judge
 and you will not be judged; do not condemn

 and it will be given to you. A good measure
 pressed down
 shaken together
 running over
 will be put into your lap; for the measure you give will be the measure you get back.\u201d","He also told them a parable: \u201cCan a blind person guide a blind person? Will not both fall into a pit?","A disciple is not above the teacher
 but everyone who is fully qualified will be like the teacher. ","Why do you see the speck in your neighbor\u2019s eye
 but do not notice the log in your own eye? ","Or how can you say to your neighbor
 \u2018Friend
 let me take out the speck in your eye
\u2019 when you yourself do not see the log in your own eye? You hypocrite
 first take the log out of your own eye

 nor again does a bad tree bear good fruit; ","for each tree is known by its own fruit. Figs are not gathered from thorns
 nor are grapes picked from a bramble bush. ","The good person out of the good treasure of the heart produces good
 and the evil person out of evil treasure produces evil; for it is out of the abundance of the heart that the mouth speaks.","\u201cWhy do you call me \u2018Lord
 Lord
\u2019 and do not do what I tell you? ","I will show you what someone is like who comes to me
 hears my words
 and acts on them. ","That one is like a man building a house
 who dug deeply and laid the foundation on rock; when a flood arose
 the river burst against that house but could not shake it
 because it had been well built. ","But the one who hears and does not act is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation. When the river burst against it
 immediately it fell

 Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: \u201cWhat did you go out into the wilderness to look at? A reed shaken by the wind? ","What then did you go out to see? Someone dressed in soft robes? Look
 those who put on fine clothing and live in luxury are in royal palaces. ","What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes

 among those born of women no one is greater than John; yet the least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.\u201d ","\u201cTo what then will I compare the people of this generation

 wisdom is vindicated by all her children.\u201d","Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw it

 \u201cYou have judged rightly.\u201d ","Then turning toward the woman
 he said to Simon
 \u201cDo you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave me no water for my feet

 have been forgiven; hence she has shown great love. But the one to whom little is forgiven
 loves little.\u201d ","Then he said to her
 \u201cYour sins are forgiven.\u201d ","And he said to the woman
 \u201cYour faith has saved you; go in peace.\u201d","When a great crowd gathered and people from town after town came to him

 it produced a hundredfold.\u201d As he said this

 when they hear the word
 receive it with joy. But these have no root; they believe only for a while and in a time of testing fall away. ","As for what fell among the thorns
 these are the ones who hear; but as they go on their way
 they are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life
 and their fruit does not mature. ","But as for that in the good soil
 these are the ones who
 when they hear the word
 hold it fast in an honest and good heart
 and bear fruit with patient endurance.","\u201cNo one after lighting a lamp hides it under a jar
 or puts it under a bed
 but puts it on a lampstand
 so that those who enter may see the light. ","For nothing is hidden that will not be disclosed

 more will be given; and from those who do not have

 \u201cWe have no more than five loaves and two fish\u2014unless we are to go and buy food for all these people.\u201d ","For there were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples
 \u201cMake them sit down in groups of about fifty each.\u201d ","Once when Jesus was praying alone
 with only the disciples near him
 he asked them
 \u201cWho do the crowds say that I am?\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cBut who do you say that I am?\u201d Peter answered
 \u201cThe Messiah of God.\u201d","saying
 \u201cThe Son of Man must undergo great suffering
 and be rejected by the elders
 chief priests
 and scribes
 and be killed
 and on the third day be raised.\u201d","Then he said to them all
 \u201cIf any want to become my followers
 let them deny themselves and take up their cross daily and follow me. ","For those who want to save their life will lose it
 and those who lose their life for my sake will save it. ","What does it profit them if they gain the whole world
 but lose or forfeit themselves? ","Those who are ashamed of me and of my words
 of them the Son of Man will be ashamed when he comes in his glory and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels. ","But truly I tell you
 there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God.\u201d","Just as they were leaving him
 Peter said to Jesus
 \u201cMaster
 it is good for us to be here; let us make three dwellings
 one for you
 one for Moses
 and one for Elijah\u201d\u2014not knowing what he said. ","Jesus answered
 \u201cYou faithless and perverse generation
 how much longer must I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here.\u201d ","\u201cLet these words sink into your ears: The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into human hands.\u201d","and said to them
 \u201cWhoever welcomes this child in my name welcomes me
 and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me; for the least among all of you is the greatest.\u201d","But Jesus said to him
 \u201cDo not stop him; for whoever is not against you is for you.\u201d","And Jesus said to him
 \u201cFoxes have holes
 and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.\u201d ","To another he said
 \u201cFollow me.\u201d But he said
 \u201cLord
 first let me go and bury my father.\u201d ","But Jesus said to him
 \u201cLet the dead bury their own dead; but as for you
 go and proclaim the kingdom of God.\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cNo one who puts a hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cThe harvest is plentiful
 but the laborers are few; therefore ask the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest. ","Go on your way. See
 I am sending you out like lambs into the midst of wolves. ","Carry no purse
 no bag
 no sandals; and greet no one on the road. ","Whatever house you enter
 first say
 \u2018Peace to this house!\u2019 ","And if anyone is there who shares in peace
 your peace will rest on that person; but if not
 it will return to you. ","Remain in the same house
 eating and drinking whatever they provide
 for the laborer deserves to be paid. Do not move about from house to house. ","Whenever you enter a town and its people welcome you
 eat what is set before you; ","cure the sick who are there
 and say to them
 \u2018The kingdom of God has come near to you.\u2019 ","But whenever you enter a town and they do not welcome you
 go out into its streets and say
 ","\u2018Even the dust of your town that clings to our feet
 we wipe off in protest against you. Yet know this: the kingdom of God has come near.\u2019 ","I tell you
 on that day it will be more tolerable for Sodom than for that town.","\u201cWoe to you
 Chorazin! Woe to you
 Bethsaida! For if the deeds of power done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon
 they would have repented long ago
 sitting in sackcloth and ashes. ","But at the judgment it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon than for you.","And you
 Capernaum
 will you be exalted to heaven? No
 you will be brought down to Hades.","\u201cWhoever listens to you listens to me
 and whoever rejects you rejects me
 and whoever rejects me rejects the one who sent me.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cI watched Satan fall from heaven like a flash of lightning. ","See
 I have given you authority to tread on snakes and scorpions
 and over all the power of the enemy; and nothing will hurt you. ","Nevertheless
 do not rejoice at this
 that the spirits submit to you
 but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.\u201d","At that same hour Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said
 \u201cI thank you
 Father
 Lord of heaven and earth
 because you have hidden these things from the wise and the intelligent and have revealed them to infants; yes
 Father
 for such was your gracious will. ","All things have been handed over to me by my Father; and no one knows who the Son is except the Father
 or who the Father is except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.\u201d","Then turning to the disciples
 Jesus said to them privately
 \u201cBlessed are the eyes that see what you see! ","For I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see what you see
 but did not see it
 and to hear what you hear
 but did not hear it.\u201d","Just then a lawyer stood up to test Jesus. \u201cTeacher
\u201d he said
 \u201cwhat must I do to inherit eternal life?\u201d ","He said to him
 \u201cWhat is written in the law? What do you read there?\u201d ","And he said to him
 \u201cYou have given the right answer; do this
 and you will live.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cA man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho
 and fell into the hands of robbers
 who stripped him
 beat him
 and went away
 leaving him half dead. ","Now by chance a priest was going down that road; and when he saw him
 he passed by on the other side. ","So likewise a Levite
 when he came to the place and saw him
 passed by on the other side. ","But a Samaritan while traveling came near him; and when he saw him
 he was moved with pity. ","He went to him and bandaged his wounds
 having poured oil and wine on them. Then he put him on his own animal
 brought him to an inn
 and took care of him. ","The next day he took out two denarii
 gave them to the innkeeper
 and said
 \u2018Take care of him; and when I come back
 I will repay you whatever more you spend.\u2019 ","Which of these three
 do you think
 was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of the robbers?\u201d ","He said
 \u201cThe one who showed him mercy.\u201d Jesus said to him
 \u201cGo and do likewise.\u201d","But the Lord answered her
 \u201cMartha
 Martha
 you are worried and distracted by many things; ","there is need of only one thing. Mary has chosen the better part
 which will not be taken away from her.\u201d","He was praying in a certain place
 and after he had finished
 one of his disciples said to him
 \u201cLord
 teach us to pray
 as John taught his disciples.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cWhen you pray
 say: Father
 hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come.","Give us each day our daily bread.","    And forgive us our sins
 for we ourselves forgive everyone indebted to us. And do not bring us to the time of trial.\u201d","And he said to them
 \u201cSuppose one of you has a friend
 and you go to him at midnight and say to him
 \u2018Friend
 lend me three loaves of bread; ","for a friend of mine has arrived
 and I have nothing to set before him.\u2019 ","And he answers from within
 \u2018Do not bother me; the door has already been locked
 and my children are with me in bed; I cannot get up and give you anything.\u2019 ","I tell you
 even though he will not get up and give him anything because he is his friend
 at least because of his persistence he will get up and give him whatever he needs.","\u201cSo I say to you
 Ask
 and it will be given you; search
 and you will find; knock
 and the door will be opened for you. ","For everyone who asks receives
 and everyone who searches finds
 and for everyone who knocks
 the door will be opened. ","Is there anyone among you who
 if your child asks for a fish
 will give a snake instead of a fish? ","Or if the child asks for an egg
 will give a scorpion? ","If you then
 who are evil
 know how to give good gifts to your children
 how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!\u201d","Now he was casting out a demon that was mute; when the demon had gone out
 the one who had been mute spoke
 and the crowds were amazed. ","But he knew what they were thinking and said to them
 \u201cEvery kingdom divided against itself becomes a desert
 and house falls on house. ","If Satan also is divided against himself
 how will his kingdom stand? \u2014for you say that I cast out the demons by Beelzebul. ","Now if I cast out the demons by Beelzebul
 by whom do your exorcists cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges. ","But if it is by the finger of God that I cast out the demons
 then the kingdom of God has come to you. ","When a strong man
 fully armed
 guards his castle
 his property is safe. ","But when one stronger than he attacks him and overpowers him
 he takes away his armor in which he trusted and divides his plunder. ","Whoever is not with me is against me
 and whoever does not gather with me scatters.","\u201cWhen the unclean spirit has gone out of a person
 it wanders through waterless regions looking for a resting place
 but not finding any
 it says
 \u2018I will return to my house from which I came.\u2019 ","When it comes
 it finds it swept and put in order. ","Then it goes and brings seven other spirits more evil than itself
 and they enter and live there; and the last state of that person is worse than the first.\u201d","While he was saying this
 a woman in the crowd raised her voice and said to him
 \u201cBlessed is the womb that bore you and the breasts that nursed you!\u201d ","But he said
 \u201cBlessed rather are those who hear the word of God and obey it!\u201d","When the crowds were increasing
 he began to say
 \u201cThis generation is an evil generation; it asks for a sign
 but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah. ","For just as Jonah became a sign to the people of Nineveh
 so the Son of Man will be to this generation. ","The queen of the South will rise at the judgment with the people of this generation and condemn them
 because she came from the ends of the earth to listen to the wisdom of Solomon
 and see
 something greater than Solomon is here! ","The people of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it
 because they repented at the proclamation of Jonah
 and see
 something greater than Jonah is here!","\u201cNo one after lighting a lamp puts it in a cellar
 but on the lampstand so that those who enter may see the light. ","Your eye is the lamp of your body. If your eye is healthy
 your whole body is full of light; but if it is not healthy
 your body is full of darkness. ","Therefore consider whether the light in you is not darkness.","If then your whole body is full of light
 with no part of it in darkness
 it will be as full of light as when a lamp gives you light with its rays.\u201d","Then the Lord said to him
 \u201cNow you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and of the dish
 but inside you are full of greed and wickedness. ","You fools! Did not the one who made the outside make the inside also?","So give for alms those things that are within; and see
 everything will be clean for you.","\u201cBut woe to you Pharisees! For you tithe mint and rue and herbs of all kinds
 and neglect justice and the love of God; it is these you ought to have practiced
 without neglecting the others. ","Woe to you Pharisees! For you love to have the seat of honor in the synagogues and to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces.","Woe to you! For you are like unmarked graves
 and people walk over them without realizing it.\u201d","And he said
 \u201cWoe also to you lawyers! For you load people with burdens hard to bear
 and you yourselves do not lift a finger to ease them. ","Woe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets whom your ancestors killed.","So you are witnesses and approve of the deeds of your ancestors; for they killed them
 and you build their tombs. ","Therefore also the Wisdom of God said
 \u2018I will send them prophets and apostles
 some of whom they will kill and persecute
\u2019 ","so that this generation may be charged with the blood of all the prophets shed since the foundation of the world
 ","from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah
 who perished between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes
 I tell you
 it will be charged against this generation. ","Woe to you lawyers! For you have taken away the key of knowledge; you did not enter yourselves
 and you hindered those who were entering.\u201d","Meanwhile
 when the crowd gathered by the thousands
 so that they trampled on one another
 he began to speak first to his disciples
 \u201cBeware of the yeast of the Pharisees
 that is
 their hypocrisy. ","Nothing is covered up that will not be uncovered
 and nothing secret that will not become known. ","Therefore whatever you have said in the dark will be heard in the light
 and what you have whispered behind closed doors will be proclaimed from the housetops.","\u201cI tell you
 my friends
 do not fear those who kill the body
 and after that can do nothing more. ","But I will warn you whom to fear: fear him who
 after he has killed
 has authority to cast into hell. Yes
 I tell you
 fear him! ","Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? Yet not one of them is forgotten in God\u2019s sight.","But even the hairs of your head are all counted. Do not be afraid; you are of more value than many sparrows.","\u201cAnd I tell you
 everyone who acknowledges me before others
 the Son of Man also will acknowledge before the angels of God; ","but whoever denies me before others will be denied before the angels of God.","And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven; but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.","When they bring you before the synagogues
 the rulers
 and the authorities
 do not worry about how you are to defend yourselves or what you are to say; ","for the Holy Spirit will teach you at that very hour what you ought to say.\u201d","But he said to him
 \u201cFriend
 who set me to be a judge or arbitrator over you?\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cTake care! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; for one\u2019s life does not consist in the abundance of possessions.\u201d ","Then he told them a parable: \u201cThe land of a rich man produced abundantly.","And he thought to himself
 \u2018What should I do
 for I have no place to store my crops?\u2019 ","Then he said
 \u2018I will do this: I will pull down my barns and build larger ones
 and there I will store all my grain and my goods. ","And I will say to my soul
 Soul
 you have ample goods laid up for many years; relax
 eat
 drink
 be merry.\u2019 ","But God said to him
 \u2018You fool! This very night your life is being demanded of you. And the things you have prepared
 whose will they be?\u2019 ","So it is with those who store up treasures for themselves but are not rich toward God.\u201d","He said to his disciples
 \u201cTherefore I tell you
 do not worry about your life
 what you will eat
 or about your body
 what you will wear. ","For life is more than food
 and the body more than clothing. ","Consider the ravens: they neither sow nor reap
 they have neither storehouse nor barn
 and yet God feeds them. Of how much more value are you than the birds! ","And can any of you by worrying add a single hour to your span of life?","If then you are not able to do so small a thing as that
 why do you worry about the rest? ","Consider the lilies
 how they grow: they neither toil nor spin; yet I tell you
 even Solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these. ","But if God so clothes the grass of the field
 which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven
 how much more will he clothe you\u2014you of little faith! ","And do not keep striving for what you are to eat and what you are to drink
 and do not keep worrying. ","For it is the nations of the world that strive after all these things
 and your Father knows that you need them. ","Instead
 strive for his kingdom
 and these things will be given to you as well.","\u201cDo not be afraid
 little flock
 for it is your Father\u2019s good pleasure to give you the kingdom. ","Sell your possessions
 and give alms. Make purses for yourselves that do not wear out
 an unfailing treasure in heaven
 where no thief comes near and no moth destroys. ","For where your treasure is
 there your heart will be also.","\u201cBe dressed for action and have your lamps lit;","be like those who are waiting for their master to return from the wedding banquet
 so that they may open the door for him as soon as he comes and knocks. ","Blessed are those slaves whom the master finds alert when he comes; truly I tell you
 he will fasten his belt and have them sit down to eat
 and he will come and serve them. ","If he comes during the middle of the night
 or near dawn
 and finds them so
 blessed are those slaves.","\u201cBut know this: if the owner of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming
 he would not have let his house be broken into. ","You also must be ready
 for the Son of Man is coming at an unexpected hour.\u201d","And the Lord said
 \u201cWho then is the faithful and prudent manager whom his master will put in charge of his slaves
 to give them their allowance of food at the proper time? ","Blessed is that slave whom his master will find at work when he arrives.","Truly I tell you
 he will put that one in charge of all his possessions. ","But if that slave says to himself
 \u2018My master is delayed in coming
\u2019 and if he begins to beat the other slaves
 men and women
 and to eat and drink and get drunk
 ","the master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour that he does not know
 and will cut him in pieces
 and put him with the unfaithful. ","That slave who knew what his master wanted
 but did not prepare himself or do what was wanted
 will receive a severe beating. ","But the one who did not know and did what deserved a beating will receive a light beating. From everyone to whom much has been given
 much will be required; and from the one to whom much has been entrusted
 even more will be demanded.","\u201cI came to bring fire to the earth
 and how I wish it were already kindled! ","I have a baptism with which to be baptized
 and what stress I am under until it is completed! ","Do you think that I have come to bring peace to the earth? No
 I tell you
 but rather division! ","From now on five in one household will be divided
 three against two and two against three; ","they will be divided: father against son and son against father
 mother against daughter and daughter against mother
 mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.\u201d","He also said to the crowds
 \u201cWhen you see a cloud rising in the west
 you immediately say
 \u2018It is going to rain\u2019; and so it happens. ","And when you see the south wind blowing
 you say
 \u2018There will be scorching heat\u2019; and it happens. ","You hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of earth and sky
 but why do you not know how to interpret the present time?","\u201cAnd why do you not judge for yourselves what is right?","Thus
 when you go with your accuser before a magistrate
 on the way make an effort to settle the case
 or you may be dragged before the judge
 and the judge hand you over to the officer
 and the officer throw you in prison. ","I tell you
 you will never get out until you have paid the very last penny.\u201d","He asked them
 \u201cDo you think that because these Galileans suffered in this way they were worse sinners than all other Galileans? ","No
 I tell you; but unless you repent
 you will all perish as they did. ","Or those eighteen who were killed when the tower of Siloam fell on them\u2014do you think that they were worse offenders than all the others living in Jerusalem?","No
 I tell you; but unless you repent
 you will all perish just as they did.\u201d","Then he told this parable: \u201cA man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came looking for fruit on it and found none.","So he said to the gardener
 \u2018See here! For three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree
 and still I find none. Cut it down! Why should it be wasting the soil?\u2019 ","He replied
 \u2018Sir
 let it alone for one more year
 until I dig around it and put manure on it. ","If it bears fruit next year
 well and good; but if not
 you can cut it down.\u2019\u201d","When Jesus saw her
 he called her over and said
 \u201cWoman
 you are set free from your ailment.\u201d ","But the Lord answered him and said
 \u201cYou hypocrites! Does not each of you on the sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from the manger
 and lead it away to give it water? ","And ought not this woman
 a daughter of Abraham whom Satan bound for eighteen long years
 be set free from this bondage on the sabbath day?\u201d ","He said therefore
 \u201cWhat is the kingdom of God like? And to what should I compare it? ","It is like a mustard seed that someone took and sowed in the garden; it grew and became a tree
 and the birds of the air made nests in its branches.\u201d","And again he said
 \u201cTo what should I compare the kingdom of God? ","It is like yeast that a woman took and mixed in with three measures of flour until all of it was leavened.\u201d","Someone asked him
 \u201cLord
 will only a few be saved?\u201d He said to them
 ","\u201cStrive to enter through the narrow door; for many
 I tell you
 will try to enter and will not be able. ","When once the owner of the house has got up and shut the door
 and you begin to stand outside and to knock at the door
 saying
 \u2018Lord
 open to us
\u2019 then in reply he will say to you
 \u2018I do not know where you come from.\u2019 ","Then you will begin to say
 \u2018We ate and drank with you
 and you taught in our streets.\u2019 ","But he will say
 \u2018I do not know where you come from; go away from me
 all you evildoers!\u2019 ","There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God
 and you yourselves thrown out. ","Then people will come from east and west
 from north and south
 and will eat in the kingdom of God. ","Indeed
 some are last who will be first
 and some are first who will be last.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cGo and tell that fox for me
 \u2018Listen
 I am casting out demons and performing cures today and tomorrow
 and on the third day I finish my work. ","Yet today
 tomorrow
 and the next day I must be on my way
 because it is impossible for a prophet to be killed outside of Jerusalem.\u2019 ","Jerusalem
 Jerusalem
 the city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it! How often have I desired to gather your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings
 and you were not willing! ","See
 your house is left to you. And I tell you
 you will not see me until the time comes when you say
 \u2018Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord.\u2019\u201d","And Jesus asked the lawyers and Pharisees
 \u201cIs it lawful to cure people on the sabbath
 or not?\u201d ","Then he said to them
 \u201cIf one of you has a child or an ox that has fallen into a well
 will you not immediately pull it out on a sabbath day?\u201d ","\u201cWhen you are invited by someone to a wedding banquet
 do not sit down at the place of honor
 in case someone more distinguished than you has been invited by your host; ","and the host who invited both of you may come and say to you
 \u2018Give this person your place
\u2019 and then in disgrace you would start to take the lowest place. ","But when you are invited
 go and sit down at the lowest place
 so that when your host comes
 he may say to you
 \u2018Friend
 move up higher\u2019; then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at the table with you. ","For all who exalt themselves will be humbled
 and those who humble themselves will be exalted.\u201d","He said also to the one who had invited him
 \u201cWhen you give a luncheon or a dinner
 do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors
 in case they may invite you in return
 and you would be repaid. ","But when you give a banquet
 invite the poor
 the crippled
 the lame
 and the blind. ","And you will be blessed
 because they cannot repay you
 for you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.\u201d","One of the dinner guests
 on hearing this
 said to him
 \u201cBlessed is anyone who will eat bread in the kingdom of God!\u201d ","Then Jesus said to him
 \u201cSomeone gave a great dinner and invited many. ","At the time for the dinner he sent his slave to say to those who had been invited
 \u2018Come; for everything is ready now.\u2019 ","But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said to him
 \u2018I have bought a piece of land
 and I must go out and see it; please accept my regrets.\u2019 ","Another said
 \u2018I have bought five yoke of oxen
 and I am going to try them out; please accept my regrets.\u2019 ","Another said
 \u2018I have just been married
 and therefore I cannot come.\u2019 ","So the slave returned and reported this to his master. Then the owner of the house became angry and said to his slave
 \u2018Go out at once into the streets and lanes of the town and bring in the poor
 the crippled
 the blind
 and the lame.\u2019 ","And the slave said
 \u2018Sir
 what you ordered has been done
 and there is still room.\u2019 ","Then the master said to the slave
 \u2018Go out into the roads and lanes
 and compel people to come in
 so that my house may be filled. ","For I tell you
 none of those who were invited will taste my dinner.\u2019\u201d","Now large crowds were traveling with him; and he turned and said to them
 ","\u201cWhoever comes to me and does not hate father and mother
 wife and children
 brothers and sisters
 yes
 and even life itself
 cannot be my disciple. ","Whoever does not carry the cross and follow me cannot be my disciple.","For which of you
 intending to build a tower
 does not first sit down and estimate the cost
 to see whether he has enough to complete it? ","Otherwise
 when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish
 all who see it will begin to ridicule him
 ","saying
 \u2018This fellow began to build and was not able to finish.\u2019 ","Or what king
 going out to wage war against another king
 will not sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to oppose the one who comes against him with twenty thousand? ","If he cannot
 then
 while the other is still far away
 he sends a delegation and asks for the terms of peace. ","So therefore
 none of you can become my disciple if you do not give up all your possessions.","\u201cSalt is good; but if salt has lost its taste
 how can its saltiness be restored? ","It is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile; they throw it away. Let anyone with ears to hear listen!\u201d","\u201cWhich one of you
 having a hundred sheep and losing one of them
 does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go after the one that is lost until he finds it? ","When he has found it
 he lays it on his shoulders and rejoices. ","And when he comes home
 he calls together his friends and neighbors
 saying to them
 \u2018Rejoice with me
 for I have found my sheep that was lost.\u2019 ","Just so
 I tell you
 there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance.","\u201cOr what woman having ten silver coins
 if she loses one of them
 does not light a lamp
 sweep the house
 and search carefully until she finds it? ","When she has found it
 she calls together her friends and neighbors

 \u2018Rejoice with me

 I tell you
 there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.\u201d","Then Jesus said
 \u201cThere was a man who had two sons. ","The younger of them said to his father
 \u2018Father
 give me the share of the property that will belong to me.\u2019 So he divided his property between them. ","A few days later the younger son gathered all he had and traveled to a distant country
 and there he squandered his property in dissolute living. ","When he had spent everything
 a severe famine took place throughout that country
 and he began to be in need. ","So he went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country
 who sent him to his fields to feed the pigs. ","He would gladly have filled himself with the pods that the pigs were eating; and no one gave him anything.","But when he came to himself he said
 \u2018How many of my father\u2019s hired hands have bread enough and to spare
 but here I am dying of hunger! ","I will get up and go to my father
 and I will say to him
 \u201cFather
 I have sinned against heaven and before you; ","I am no longer worthy to be called your son; treat me like one of your hired hands.\u201d\u2019","So he set off and went to his father. But while he was still far off
 his father saw him and was filled with compassion; he ran and put his arms around him and kissed him. ","Then the son said to him
 \u2018Father
 I have sinned against heaven and before you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son.\u2019 ","But the father said to his slaves
 \u2018Quickly
 bring out a robe\u2014the best one\u2014and put it on him; put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. ","And get the fatted calf and kill it
 and let us eat and celebrate; ","for this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found!\u2019 And they began to celebrate.","\u201cNow his elder son was in the field; and when he came and approached the house
 he heard music and dancing. ","He called one of the slaves and asked what was going on.","He replied
 \u2018Your brother has come
 and your father has killed the fatted calf
 because he has got him back safe and sound.\u2019 ","Then he became angry and refused to go in. His father came out and began to plead with him.","But he answered his father
 \u2018Listen! For all these years I have been working like a slave for you
 and I have never disobeyed your command; yet you have never given me even a young goat so that I might celebrate with my friends. ","But when this son of yours came back
 who has devoured your property with prostitutes
 you killed the fatted calf for him!\u2019 ","Then the father said to him
 \u2018Son
 you are always with me
 and all that is mine is yours. ","But we had to celebrate and rejoice
 because this brother of yours was dead and has come to life; he was lost and has been found.\u2019\u201d","Then Jesus said to the disciples
 \u201cThere was a rich man who had a manager
 and charges were brought to him that this man was squandering his property. ","So he summoned him and said to him
 \u2018What is this that I hear about you? Give me an accounting of your management
 because you cannot be my manager any longer.\u2019 ","Then the manager said to himself
 \u2018What will I do
 now that my master is taking the position away from me? I am not strong enough to dig
 and I am ashamed to beg. ","I have decided what to do so that
 when I am dismissed as manager
 people may welcome me into their homes.\u2019 ","So
 summoning his master\u2019s debtors one by one
 he asked the first
 \u2018How much do you owe my master?\u2019 ","He answered
 \u2018A hundred jugs of olive oil.\u2019 He said to him
 \u2018Take your bill
 sit down quickly
 and make it fifty.\u2019 ","Then he asked another
 \u2018And how much do you owe?\u2019 He replied
 \u2018A hundred containers of wheat.\u2019 He said to him
 \u2018Take your bill and make it eighty.\u2019 ","And his master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly; for the children of this age are more shrewd in dealing with their own generation than are the children of light.","And I tell you
 make friends for yourselves by means of dishonest wealth so that when it is gone
 they may welcome you into the eternal homes.","\u201cWhoever is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much; and whoever is dishonest in a very little is dishonest also in much.","If then you have not been faithful with the dishonest wealth
 who will entrust to you the true riches? ","And if you have not been faithful with what belongs to another
 who will give you what is your own? ","No slave can serve two masters; for a slave will either hate the one and love the other
 or be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth.\u201d","So he said to them
 \u201cYou are those who justify yourselves in the sight of others; but God knows your hearts; for what is prized by human beings is an abomination in the sight of God.","\u201cThe law and the prophets were in effect until John came; since then the good news of the kingdom of God is proclaimed
 and everyone tries to enter it by force. ","But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away
 than for one stroke of a letter in the law to be dropped.","\u201cAnyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery
 and whoever marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery.","\u201cThere was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and who feasted sumptuously every day.","And at his gate lay a poor man named Lazarus
 covered with sores
 ","who longed to satisfy his hunger with what fell from the rich man\u2019s table; even the dogs would come and lick his sores.","The poor man died and was carried away by the angels to be with Abraham. The rich man also died and was buried.","In Hades
 where he was being tormented
 he looked up and saw Abraham far away with Lazarus by his side. ","He called out
 \u2018Father Abraham
 have mercy on me
 and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue; for I am in agony in these flames.\u2019 ","But Abraham said
 \u2018Child
 remember that during your lifetime you received your good things
 and Lazarus in like manner evil things; but now he is comforted here
 and you are in agony. ","Besides all this
 between you and us a great chasm has been fixed
 so that those who might want to pass from here to you cannot do so
 and no one can cross from there to us.\u2019 ","He said
 \u2018Then
 father
 I beg you to send him to my father\u2019s house\u2014 ","for I have five brothers\u2014that he may warn them
 so that they will not also come into this place of torment.\u2019 ","Abraham replied
 \u2018They have Moses and the prophets; they should listen to them.\u2019 ","He said
 \u2018No
 father Abraham; but if someone goes to them from the dead
 they will repent.\u2019 ","He said to him
 \u2018If they do not listen to Moses and the prophets
 neither will they be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.\u2019\u201d","Jesus said to his disciples
 \u201cOccasions for stumbling are bound to come
 but woe to anyone by whom they come! ","It would be better for you if a millstone were hung around your neck and you were thrown into the sea than for you to cause one of these little ones to stumble.","Be on your guard! If another disciple sins
 you must rebuke the offender
 and if there is repentance
 you must forgive. ","And if the same person sins against you seven times a day
 and turns back to you seven times and says
 \u2018I repent
\u2019 you must forgive.\u201d","The Lord replied
 \u201cIf you had faith the size of a mustard seed
 you could say to this mulberry tree
 \u2018Be uprooted and planted in the sea
\u2019 and it would obey you.","\u201cWho among you would say to your slave who has just come in from plowing or tending sheep in the field
 \u2018Come here at once and take your place at the table\u2019? ","Would you not rather say to him
 \u2018Prepare supper for me
 put on your apron and serve me while I eat and drink; later you may eat and drink\u2019? ","Do you thank the slave for doing what was commanded?","So you also
 when you have done all that you were ordered to do
 say
 \u2018We are worthless slaves; we have done only what we ought to have done!\u2019\u201d","On the way to Jerusalem Jesus was going through the region between Samaria and Galilee.","When he saw them
 he said to them
 \u201cGo and show yourselves to the priests.\u201d And as they went
 they were made clean. ","Then Jesus asked
 \u201cWere not ten made clean? But the other nine
 where are they? ","Was none of them found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?\u201d","Then he said to him
 \u201cGet up and go on your way; your faith has made you well.\u201d","Once Jesus was asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God was coming
 and he answered
 \u201cThe kingdom of God is not coming with things that can be observed; ","nor will they say
 \u2018Look
 here it is!\u2019 or \u2018There it is!\u2019 For
 in fact
 the kingdom of God is among you.\u201d","Then he said to the disciples
 \u201cThe days are coming when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man
 and you will not see it. ","They will say to you
 \u2018Look there!\u2019 or \u2018Look here!\u2019 Do not go
 do not set off in pursuit. ","For as the lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one side to the other
 so will the Son of Man be in his day. ","But first he must endure much suffering and be rejected by this generation.","Just as it was in the days of Noah
 so too it will be in the days of the Son of Man. ","They were eating and drinking
 and marrying and being given in marriage
 until the day Noah entered the ark
 and the flood came and destroyed all of them. ","Likewise
 just as it was in the days of Lot: they were eating and drinking
 buying and selling
 planting and building
 ","but on the day that Lot left Sodom
 it rained fire and sulfur from heaven and destroyed all of them ","\u2014it will be like that on the day that the Son of Man is revealed.","On that day
 anyone on the housetop who has belongings in the house must not come down to take them away; and likewise anyone in the field must not turn back. ","Remember Lot\u2019s wife.","Those who try to make their life secure will lose it
 but those who lose their life will keep it. ","I tell you
 on that night there will be two in one bed; one will be taken and the other left. ","There will be two women grinding meal together; one will be taken and the other left.\u201d","Then they asked him
 \u201cWhere
 Lord?\u201d He said to them
 \u201cWhere the corpse is
 there the vultures will gather.\u201d","He said
 \u201cIn a certain city there was a judge who neither feared God nor had respect for people. ","In that city there was a widow who kept coming to him and saying
 \u2018Grant me justice against my opponent.\u2019 ","For a while he refused; but later he said to himself
 \u2018Though I have no fear of God and no respect for anyone
 ","yet because this widow keeps bothering me
 I will grant her justice
 so that she may not wear me out by continually coming.\u2019\u201d ","And the Lord said
 \u201cListen to what the unjust judge says. ","And will not God grant justice to his chosen ones who cry to him day and night? Will he delay long in helping them?","I tell you
 he will quickly grant justice to them. And yet
 when the Son of Man comes
 will he find faith on earth?\u201d","\u201cTwo men went up to the temple to pray
 one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. ","The Pharisee
 standing by himself
 was praying thus
 \u2018God
 I thank you that I am not like other people: thieves
 rogues
 adulterers
 or even like this tax collector. ","I fast twice a week; I give a tenth of all my income.\u2019","But the tax collector
 standing far off
 would not even look up to heaven
 but was beating his breast and saying
 \u2018God
 be merciful to me
 a sinner!\u2019 ","I tell you
 this man went down to his home justified rather than the other; for all who exalt themselves will be humbled
 but all who humble themselves will be exalted.\u201d","But Jesus called for them and said
 \u201cLet the little children come to me
 and do not stop them; for it is to such as these that the kingdom of God belongs. ","Truly I tell you
 whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will never enter it.\u201d","Jesus said to him
 \u201cWhy do you call me good? No one is good but God alone. ","You know the commandments: \u2018You shall not commit adultery; You shall not murder; You shall not steal; You shall not bear false witness; Honor your father and mother.\u2019\u201d","He replied
 \u201cI have kept all these since my youth.\u201d ","When Jesus heard this
 he said to him
 \u201cThere is still one thing lacking. Sell all that you own and distribute the money to the poor
 and you will have treasure in heaven; then come
 follow me.\u201d ","Jesus looked at him and said
 \u201cHow hard it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God! ","Indeed
 it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.\u201d","He replied
 \u201cWhat is impossible for mortals is possible for God.\u201d","And he said to them
 \u201cTruly I tell you
 there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children
 for the sake of the kingdom of God
 ","who will not get back very much more in this age
 and in the age to come eternal life.\u201d","Then he took the twelve aside and said to them
 \u201cSee
 we are going up to Jerusalem
 and everything that is written about the Son of Man by the prophets will be accomplished. ","For he will be handed over to the Gentiles; and he will be mocked and insulted and spat upon.","After they have flogged him
 they will kill him
 and on the third day he will rise again.\u201d ","But they understood nothing about all these things; in fact
 what he said was hidden from them
 and they did not grasp what was said.","\u201cWhat do you want me to do for you?\u201d He said
 \u201cLord
 let me see again.\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cReceive your sight; your faith has saved you.\u201d ","When Jesus came to the place
 he looked up and said to him
 \u201cZacchaeus
 hurry and come down; for I must stay at your house today.\u201d ","Zacchaeus stood there and said to the Lord
 \u201cLook
 half of my possessions
 Lord
 I will give to the poor; and if I have defrauded anyone of anything
 I will pay back four times as much.\u201d ","Then Jesus said to him
 \u201cToday salvation has come to this house
 because he too is a son of Abraham. ","For the Son of Man came to seek out and to save the lost.\u201d","So he said
 \u201cA nobleman went to a distant country to get royal power for himself and then return. ","He summoned ten of his slaves
 and gave them ten pounds
 and said to them
 \u2018Do business with these until I come back.\u2019 ","But the citizens of his country hated him and sent a delegation after him
 saying
 \u2018We do not want this man to rule over us.\u2019 ","When he returned
 having received royal power
 he ordered these slaves
 to whom he had given the money
 to be summoned so that he might find out what they had gained by trading. ","The first came forward and said
 \u2018Lord
 your pound has made ten more pounds.\u2019 ","He said to him
 \u2018Well done
 good slave! Because you have been trustworthy in a very small thing
 take charge of ten cities.\u2019 ","Then the second came
 saying
 \u2018Lord
 your pound has made five pounds.\u2019 ","He said to him
 \u2018And you
 rule over five cities.\u2019 ","Then the other came
 saying
 \u2018Lord
 here is your pound. I wrapped it up in a piece of cloth
 ","for I was afraid of you
 because you are a harsh man; you take what you did not deposit
 and reap what you did not sow.\u2019 ","He said to him
 \u2018I will judge you by your own words
 you wicked slave! You knew
 did you
 that I was a harsh man
 taking what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not sow? ","Why then did you not put my money into the bank? Then when I returned
 I could have collected it with interest.\u2019 ","He said to the bystanders
 \u2018Take the pound from him and give it to the one who has ten pounds.\u2019 ","(And they said to him
 \u2018Lord
 he has ten pounds!\u2019) ","\u2018I tell you
 to all those who have
 more will be given; but from those who have nothing
 even what they have will be taken away. ","But as for these enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them\u2014bring them here and slaughter them in my presence.\u2019\u201d","saying
 \u201cGo into the village ahead of you
 and as you enter it you will find tied there a colt that has never been ridden. Untie it and bring it here. ","If anyone asks you
 \u2018Why are you untying it?\u2019 just say this
 \u2018The Lord needs it.\u2019\u201d ","Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him
 \u201cTeacher
 order your disciples to stop.\u201d ","He answered
 \u201cI tell you
 if these were silent
 the stones would shout out.\u201d","saying
 \u201cIf you
 even you
 had only recognized on this day the things that make for peace! But now they are hidden from your eyes. ","Indeed
 the days will come upon you
 when your enemies will set up ramparts around you and surround you
 and hem you in on every side. ","They will crush you to the ground
 you and your children within you
 and they will not leave within you one stone upon another; because you did not recognize the time of your visitation from God.\u201d","and he said
 \u201cIt is written
 \u2018My house shall be a house of prayer\u2019; but you have made it a den of robbers.\u201d","He answered them
 \u201cI will also ask you a question
 and you tell me: ","Did the baptism of John come from heaven
 or was it of human origin?\u201d ","Then Jesus said to them
 \u201cNeither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.\u201d","He began to tell the people this parable: \u201cA man planted a vineyard
 and leased it to tenants
 and went to another country for a long time. ","When the season came
 he sent a slave to the tenants in order that they might give him his share of the produce of the vineyard; but the tenants beat him and sent him away empty-handed. ","Next he sent another slave; that one also they beat and insulted and sent away empty-handed.","And he sent still a third; this one also they wounded and threw out.","Then the owner of the vineyard said
 \u2018What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; perhaps they will respect him.\u2019 ","But when the tenants saw him
 they discussed it among themselves and said
 \u2018This is the heir; let us kill him so that the inheritance may be ours.\u2019 ","So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?","He will come and destroy those tenants and give the vineyard to others.\u201d When they heard this
 they said
 \u201cHeaven forbid!\u201d ","But he looked at them and said
 \u201cWhat then does this text mean: \u2018The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone\u2019?","Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces; and it will crush anyone on whom it falls.\u201d","So they watched him and sent spies who pretended to be honest
 in order to trap him by what he said
 so as to hand him over to the jurisdiction and authority of the governor. ","\u201cShow me a denarius. Whose head and whose title does it bear?\u201d They said
 \u201cThe emperor\u2019s.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cThen give to the emperor the things that are the emperor\u2019s
 and to God the things that are God\u2019s.\u201d ","And they were not able in the presence of the people to trap him by what he said; and being amazed by his answer
 they became silent.","Jesus said to them
 \u201cThose who belong to this age marry and are given in marriage; ","but those who are considered worthy of a place in that age and in the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage.","Indeed they cannot die anymore
 because they are like angels and are children of God
 being children of the resurrection. ","And the fact that the dead are raised Moses himself showed
 in the story about the bush
 where he speaks of the Lord as the God of Abraham
 the God of Isaac
 and the God of Jacob. ","Now he is God not of the dead
 but of the living; for to him all of them are alive.\u201d ","Then he said to them
 \u201cHow can they say that the Messiah is David\u2019s son? ","For David himself says in the book of Psalms
 \u2018The Lord said to my Lord
 \u201cSit at my right hand
","until I make your enemies your footstool.\u201d\u2019","David thus calls him Lord; so how can he be his son?\u201d","\u201cBeware of the scribes
 who like to walk around in long robes
 and love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces
 and to have the best seats in the synagogues and places of honor at banquets. ","They devour widows\u2019 houses and for the sake of appearance say long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation.\u201d","He said
 \u201cTruly I tell you
 this poor widow has put in more than all of them; ","for all of them have contributed out of their abundance
 but she out of her poverty has put in all she had to live on.\u201d","\u201cAs for these things that you see
 the days will come when not one stone will be left upon another; all will be thrown down.\u201d","And he said
 \u201cBeware that you are not led astray; for many will come in my name and say
 \u2018I am he!\u2019 and
 \u2018The time is near!\u2019 Do not go after them.","\u201cWhen you hear of wars and insurrections
 do not be terrified; for these things must take place first
 but the end will not follow immediately.\u201d ","Then he said to them
 \u201cNation will rise against nation
 and kingdom against kingdom; ","there will be great earthquakes
 and in various places famines and plagues; and there will be dreadful portents and great signs from heaven.","\u201cBut before all this occurs
 they will arrest you and persecute you; they will hand you over to synagogues and prisons
 and you will be brought before kings and governors because of my name. ","This will give you an opportunity to testify.","So make up your minds not to prepare your defense in advance;","for I will give you words and a wisdom that none of your opponents will be able to withstand or contradict.","You will be betrayed even by parents and brothers
 by relatives and friends; and they will put some of you to death. ","You will be hated by all because of my name.","But not a hair of your head will perish.","By your endurance you will gain your souls.","\u201cWhen you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies
 then know that its desolation has come near. ","Then those in Judea must flee to the mountains
 and those inside the city must leave it
 and those out in the country must not enter it; ","for these are days of vengeance
 as a fulfillment of all that is written. ","Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing infants in those days! For there will be great distress on the earth and wrath against this people;","they will fall by the edge of the sword and be taken away as captives among all nations; and Jerusalem will be trampled on by the Gentiles
 until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.","\u201cThere will be signs in the sun
 the moon
 and the stars
 and on the earth distress among nations confused by the roaring of the sea and the waves. ","People will faint from fear and foreboding of what is coming upon the world
 for the powers of the heavens will be shaken. ","Then they will see \u2018the Son of Man coming in a cloud\u2019 with power and great glory.","Now when these things begin to take place
 stand up and raise your heads
 because your redemption is drawing near.\u201d","Then he told them a parable: \u201cLook at the fig tree and all the trees;","as soon as they sprout leaves you can see for yourselves and know that summer is already near.","So also
 when you see these things taking place
 you know that the kingdom of God is near. ","Truly I tell you
 this generation will not pass away until all things have taken place. ","Heaven and earth will pass away
 but my words will not pass away.","\u201cBe on guard so that your hearts are not weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and the worries of this life
 and that day does not catch you unexpectedly
 ","like a trap. For it will come upon all who live on the face of the whole earth.","Be alert at all times
 praying that you may have the strength to escape all these things that will take place
 and to stand before the Son of Man.\u201d","So Jesus sent Peter and John
 saying
 \u201cGo and prepare the Passover meal for us that we may eat it.\u201d ","\u201cListen

 \u201cWhere is the guest room
 where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?\u201d\u2019 ","He will show you a large room upstairs
 already furnished. Make preparations for us there.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cI have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer; ","for I tell you
 I will not eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.\u201d ","Then he took a cup
 and after giving thanks he said
 \u201cTake this and divide it among yourselves; ","for I tell you that from now on I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.\u201d","Then he took a loaf of bread
 and when he had given thanks
 he broke it and gave it to them

 \u201cThis cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood. ","But see
 the one who betrays me is with me

 \u201cThe kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and those in authority over them are called benefactors. ","But not so with you; rather the greatest among you must become like the youngest

 the one who is at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one at the table? But I am among you as one who serves.","\u201cYou are those who have stood by me in my trials;","and I confer on you

 Simon
 listen! Satan has demanded to sift all of you like wheat

 tell us.\u201d He replied
 \u201cIf I tell you
 you will not believe; ","and if I question you
 you will not answer. ","But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.\u201d","All of them asked
 \u201cAre you
 then
 the Son of God?\u201d He said to them
 \u201cYou say that I am.\u201d ","Then Pilate asked him
 \u201cAre you the king of the Jews?\u201d He answered
 \u201cYou say so.\u201d ","When Pilate heard this
 he asked whether the man was a Galilean. ","and said to them
 \u201cYou brought me this man as one who was perverting the people; and here I have examined him in your presence and have not found this man guilty of any of your charges against him. ","A third time he said to them
 \u201cWhy
 what evil has he done? I have found in him no ground for the sentence of death; I will therefore have him flogged and then release him.\u201d ","But Jesus turned to them and said
 \u201cDaughters of Jerusalem
 do not weep for me
 but weep for yourselves and for your children. ","For the days are surely coming when they will say
 \u2018Blessed are the barren
 and the wombs that never bore
 and the breasts that never nursed.\u2019 ","Then they will begin to say to the mountains
 \u2018Fall on us\u2019; and to the hills
 \u2018Cover us.\u2019 ","For if they do this when the wood is green
 what will happen when it is dry?\u201d","Then Jesus said
 \u201cFather
 forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing.\u201d]] And they cast lots to divide his clothing. ","He replied
 \u201cTruly I tell you
 today you will be with me in Paradise.\u201d","Then Jesus
 crying with a loud voice
 said
 \u201cFather
 into your hands I commend my spirit.\u201d Having said this
 he breathed his last. ","The women were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground
 but the men said to them
 \u201cWhy do you look for the living among the dead? He is not here
 but has risen. ","And he said to them
 \u201cWhat are you discussing with each other while you walk along?\u201d They stood still
 looking sad. ","He asked them
 \u201cWhat things?\u201d They replied
 \u201cThe things about Jesus of Nazareth
 who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people
 ","Then he said to them
 \u201cOh
 how foolish you are
 and how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have declared! ","Was it not necessary that the Messiah should suffer these things and then enter into his glory?\u201d","While they were talking about this
 Jesus himself stood among them and said to them
 \u201cPeace be with you.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cWhy are you frightened
 and why do doubts arise in your hearts? ","Look at my hands and my feet; see that it is I myself. Touch me and see; for a ghost does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have.\u201d","While in their joy they were disbelieving and still wondering
 he said to them
 \u201cHave you anything here to eat?\u201d ","Then he said to them
 \u201cThese are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you\u2014that everything written about me in the law of Moses
 the prophets
 and the psalms must be fulfilled.\u201d ","and he said to them
 \u201cThus it is written
 that the Messiah is to suffer and to rise from the dead on the third day
 ","and that repentance and forgiveness of sins is to be proclaimed in his name to all nations
 beginning from Jerusalem. ","You are witnesses of these things.","And see
 I am sending upon you what my Father promised; so stay here in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high.\u201d","He said to them
 \u2018Why were you searching for me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father\u2019s house?\u2019 ","Jesus answered him
 \u2018It is written
 \u201cOne does not live by bread alone.\u201d\u2019","And the devil said to him
 \u2018To you I will give their glory and all this authority; for it has been given over to me
 and I give it to anyone I please. ","Jesus answered him
 \u2018It is written
 \u201cWorship the Lord your God
 and serve only him.\u201d\u2019","Then the devil took him to Jerusalem
 and placed him on the pinnacle of the temple
 saying to him
 \u2018If you are the Son of God
 throw yourself down from here
 ","Jesus answered him
 \u2018It is said
 \u201cDo not put the Lord your God to the test.\u201d\u2019 ","\u2018The Spirit of the Lord is upon me
 because he has anointed me to bring good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind
 to let the oppressed go free
","to proclaim the year of the Lord\u2019s favour.\u2019","Then he began to say to them
 \u2018Today this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.\u2019 ","He said to them
 \u2018Doubtless you will quote to me this proverb
 \u201cDoctor
 cure yourself!\u201d And you will say
 \u201cDo here also in your home town the things that we have heard you did at Capernaum.\u201d\u2019 ","And he said
 \u2018Truly I tell you
 no prophet is accepted in the prophet\u2019s home town. ","But the truth is
 there were many widows in Israel in the time of Elijah
 when the heaven was shut up for three years and six months
 and there was a severe famine over all the land; ","yet Elijah was sent to none of them except to a widow at Zarephath in Sidon.","There were also many lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha
 and none of them was cleansed except Naaman the Syrian.\u2019 ","They were astounded at his teaching
 because he spoke with authority. ","But Jesus rebuked him
 saying
 \u2018Be silent
 and come out of him!\u2019 When the demon had thrown him down before them
 he came out of him without having done him any harm. ","Demons also came out of many
 shouting
 \u2018You are the Son of God!\u2019 But he rebuked them and would not allow them to speak
 because they knew that he was the Messiah.","But he said to them
 \u2018I must proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God to the other cities also; for I was sent for this purpose.\u2019 ","When he had finished speaking
 he said to Simon
 \u2018Put out into the deep water and let down your nets for a catch.\u2019 ","and so also were James and John
 sons of Zebedee
 who were partners with Simon. Then Jesus said to Simon
 \u2018Do not be afraid; from now on you will be catching people.\u2019 ","Then Jesus stretched out his hand
 touched him
 and said
 \u2018I do choose. Be made clean.\u2019 Immediately the leprosy left him. ","And he ordered him to tell no one. \u2018Go\u2019
 he said
 \u2018and show yourself to the priest
 and
 as Moses commanded
 make an offering for your cleansing
 for a testimony to them.\u2019 ","When he saw their faith
 he said
 \u2018Friend
 your sins are forgiven you.\u2019 ","When Jesus perceived their questionings
 he answered them
 \u2018Why do you raise such questions in your hearts? ","Which is easier
 to say
 \u201cYour sins are forgiven you\u201d
 or to say
 \u201cStand up and walk\u201d? ","But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins\u2019\u2014he said to the one who was paralysed\u2014\u2018I say to you
 stand up and take your bed and go to your home.\u2019 ","After this he went out and saw a tax-collector named Levi
 sitting at the tax booth; and he said to him
 \u2018Follow me.\u2019 ","Jesus answered
 \u2018Those who are well have no need of a physician
 but those who are sick; ","I have come to call not the righteous but sinners to repentance.\u2019","Then they said to him
 \u2018John\u2019s disciples
 like the disciples of the Pharisees
 frequently fast and pray
 but your disciples eat and drink.\u2019 ","Jesus said to them
 \u2018You cannot make wedding-guests fast while the bridegroom is with them
 can you? ","The days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them
 and then they will fast in those days.\u2019 ","He also told them a parable: \u2018No one tears a piece from a new garment and sews it on an old garment; otherwise the new will be torn
 and the piece from the new will not match the old. ","And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; otherwise the new wine will burst the skins and will be spilled
 and the skins will be destroyed. ","But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins.","And no one after drinking old wine desires new wine
 but says
 \u201cThe old is good.\u201d\u2019","Jesus answered
 \u2018Have you not read what David did when he and his companions were hungry? ","He entered the house of God and took and ate the bread of the Presence
 which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat
 and gave some to his companions?\u2019 ","Then he said to them
 \u2018The Son of Man is lord of the sabbath.\u2019","Even though he knew what they were thinking
 he said to the man who had the withered hand
 \u2018Come and stand here.\u2019 He got up and stood there. ","Then Jesus said to them
 \u2018I ask you
 is it lawful to do good or to do harm on the sabbath
 to save life or to destroy it?\u2019 ","After looking around at all of them
 he said to him
 \u2018Stretch out your hand.\u2019 He did so
 and his hand was restored. ","\u2018Blessed are you who are hungry now
 for you will be filled. \u2018Blessed are you who weep now
 for you will laugh.","\u2018Blessed are you when people hate you
 and when they exclude you
 revile you
 and defame you on account of the Son of Man. ","Rejoice on that day and leap for joy
 for surely your reward is great in heaven; for that is what their ancestors did to the prophets.","\u2018But woe to you who are rich
 for you have received your consolation.","\u2018Woe to you who are full now
 for you will be hungry. \u2018Woe to you who are laughing now
 for you will mourn and weep.","\u2018Woe to you when all speak well of you
 for that is what their ancestors did to the false prophets.","\u2018But I say to you that listen
 Love your enemies
 do good to those who hate you
 ","bless those who curse you
 pray for those who abuse you. ","If anyone strikes you on the cheek
 offer the other also; and from anyone who takes away your coat do not withhold even your shirt. ","Give to everyone who begs from you; and if anyone takes away your goods
 do not ask for them again. ","Do to others as you would have them do to you.","\u2018If you love those who love you
 what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them. ","If you do good to those who do good to you
 what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same. ","If you lend to those from whom you hope to receive
 what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners
 to receive as much again. ","But love your enemies
 do good
 and lend
 expecting nothing in return. Your reward will be great
 and you will be children of the Most High; for he is kind to the ungrateful and the wicked. ","Be merciful
 just as your Father is merciful.","\u2018Do not judge
 and you will not be judged; do not condemn
 and you will not be condemned. Forgive
 and you will be forgiven; ","give
 and it will be given to you. A good measure
 pressed down
 shaken together
 running over
 will be put into your lap; for the measure you give will be the measure you get back.\u2019","He also told them a parable: \u2018Can a blind person guide a blind person? Will not both fall into a pit?","A disciple is not above the teacher
 but everyone who is fully qualified will be like the teacher. ","Why do you see the speck in your neighbour\u2019s eye
 but do not notice the log in your own eye? ","Or how can you say to your neighbour
 \u201cFriend
 let me take out the speck in your eye\u201d
 when you yourself do not see the log in your own eye? You hypocrite
 first take the log out of your own eye
 and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your neighbour\u2019s eye.","\u2018No good tree bears bad fruit
 nor again does a bad tree bear good fruit; ","for each tree is known by its own fruit. Figs are not gathered from thorns
 nor are grapes picked from a bramble bush. ","The good person out of the good treasure of the heart produces good
 and the evil person out of evil treasure produces evil; for it is out of the abundance of the heart that the mouth speaks.","\u2018Why do you call me \u201cLord
 Lord\u201d
 and do not do what I tell you? ","I will show you what someone is like who comes to me
 hears my words
 and acts on them. ","That one is like a man building a house
 who dug deeply and laid the foundation on rock; when a flood arose
 the river burst against that house but could not shake it
 because it had been well built. ","But the one who hears and does not act is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation. When the river burst against it
 immediately it fell
 and great was the ruin of that house.\u2019","When Jesus heard this he was amazed at him
 and turning to the crowd that followed him
 he said
 \u2018I tell you
 not even in Israel have I found such faith.\u2019 ","When the Lord saw her
 he had compassion for her and said to her
 \u2018Do not weep.\u2019 ","Then he came forward and touched the bier
 and the bearers stood still. And he said
 \u2018Young man
 I say to you
 rise!\u2019 ","And he answered them
 \u2018Go and tell John what you have seen and heard: the blind receive their sight
 the lame walk
 the lepers are cleansed
 the deaf hear
 the dead are raised
 the poor have good news brought to them. ","And blessed is anyone who takes no offence at me.\u2019","When John\u2019s messengers had gone
 Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: \u2018What did you go out into the wilderness to look at? A reed shaken by the wind? ","What then did you go out to see? Someone dressed in soft robes? Look
 those who put on fine clothing and live in luxury are in royal palaces. ","What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes
 I tell you
 and more than a prophet. ","This is the one about whom it is written
 \u201cSee
 I am sending my messenger ahead of you
 who will prepare your way before you.\u201d","I tell you
 among those born of women no one is greater than John; yet the least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.\u2019 ","\u2018To what then will I compare the people of this generation
 and what are they like? ","They are like children sitting in the market-place and calling to one another
 \u201cWe played the flute for you
 and you did not dance; we wailed
 and you did not weep.\u201d","For John the Baptist has come eating no bread and drinking no wine
 and you say
 \u201cHe has a demon\u201d; ","the Son of Man has come eating and drinking
 and you say
 \u201cLook
 a glutton and a drunkard
 a friend of tax-collectors and sinners!\u201d ","Nevertheless
 wisdom is vindicated by all her children.\u2019","Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw it
 he said to himself
 \u2018If this man were a prophet
 he would have known who and what kind of woman this is who is touching him\u2014that she is a sinner.\u2019 ","Jesus spoke up and said to him
 \u2018Simon
 I have something to say to you.\u2019 \u2018Teacher
\u2019 he replied
 \u2018speak.\u2019 ","\u2018A certain creditor had two debtors; one owed five hundred denarii
 and the other fifty. ","When they could not pay
 he cancelled the debts for both of them. Now which of them will love him more?\u2019 ","Simon answered
 \u2018I suppose the one for whom he cancelled the greater debt.\u2019 And Jesus said to him
 \u2018You have judged rightly.\u2019 ","Then turning towards the woman
 he said to Simon
 \u2018Do you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave me no water for my feet
 but she has bathed my feet with her tears and dried them with her hair. ","You gave me no kiss
 but from the time I came in she has not stopped kissing my feet. ","You did not anoint my head with oil
 but she has anointed my feet with ointment. ","Therefore
 I tell you
 her sins
 which were many
 have been forgiven; hence she has shown great love. But the one to whom little is forgiven
 loves little.\u2019 ","Then he said to her
 \u2018Your sins are forgiven.\u2019 ","And he said to the woman
 \u2018Your faith has saved you; go in peace.\u2019","When a great crowd gathered and people from town after town came to him
 he said in a parable: ","\u2018A sower went out to sow his seed; and as he sowed
 some fell on the path and was trampled on
 and the birds of the air ate it up. ","Some fell on the rock; and as it grew up
 it withered for lack of moisture. ","Some fell among thorns
 and the thorns grew with it and choked it. ","Some fell into good soil
 and when it grew
 it produced a hundredfold.\u2019 As he said this
 he called out
 \u2018Let anyone with ears to hear listen!\u2019","He said
 \u2018To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of God; but to others I speak in parables
 so that \u201clooking they may not perceive
 and listening they may not understand.\u201d","\u2018Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.","The ones on the path are those who have heard; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts
 so that they may not believe and be saved. ","The ones on the rock are those who
 when they hear the word
 receive it with joy. But these have no root; they believe only for a while and in a time of testing fall away. ","As for what fell among the thorns
 these are the ones who hear; but as they go on their way
 they are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life
 and their fruit does not mature. ","But as for that in the good soil
 these are the ones who
 when they hear the word
 hold it fast in an honest and good heart
 and bear fruit with patient endurance.","\u2018No one after lighting a lamp hides it under a jar
 or puts it under a bed
 but puts it on a lampstand
 so that those who enter may see the light. ","For nothing is hidden that will not be disclosed
 nor is anything secret that will not become known and come to light. ","Then pay attention to how you listen; for to those who have
 more will be given; and from those who do not have
 even what they seem to have will be taken away.\u2019","And he was told
 \u2018Your mother and your brothers are standing outside
 wanting to see you.\u2019 ","But he said to them
 \u2018My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God and do it.\u2019","One day he got into a boat with his disciples
 and he said to them
 \u2018Let us go across to the other side of the lake.\u2019 So they put out
 ","He said to them
 \u2018Where is your faith?\u2019 They were afraid and amazed
 and said to one another
 \u2018Who then is this
 that he commands even the winds and the water
 and they obey him?\u2019","Jesus then asked him
 \u2018What is your name?\u2019 He said
 \u2018Legion\u2019; for many demons had entered him. ","\u2018Return to your home
 and declare how much God has done for you.\u2019 So he went away
 proclaiming throughout the city how much Jesus had done for him.","Then Jesus asked
 \u2018Who touched me?\u2019 When all denied it
 Peter said
 \u2018Master
 the crowds surround you and press in on you.\u2019 ","But Jesus said
 \u2018Someone touched me; for I noticed that power had gone out from me.\u2019 ","He said to her
 \u2018Daughter
 your faith has made you well; go in peace.\u2019","When Jesus heard this
 he replied
 \u2018Do not fear. Only believe
 and she will be saved.\u2019 ","They were all weeping and wailing for her; but he said
 \u2018Do not weep; for she is not dead but sleeping.\u2019 ","But he took her by the hand and called out
 \u2018Child
 get up!\u2019 ","He said to them
 \u2018Take nothing for your journey
 no staff
 nor bag
 nor bread
 nor money\u2014not even an extra tunic. ","Whatever house you enter
 stay there
 and leave from there. ","Wherever they do not welcome you
 as you are leaving that town shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them.\u2019 ","But he said to them
 \u2018You give them something to eat.\u2019 They said
 \u2018We have no more than five loaves and two fish\u2014unless we are to go and buy food for all these people.\u2019 ","For there were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples
 \u2018Make them sit down in groups of about fifty each.\u2019 ","Once when Jesus was praying alone
 with only the disciples near him
 he asked them
 \u2018Who do the crowds say that I am?\u2019 ","He said to them
 \u2018But who do you say that I am?\u2019 Peter answered
 \u2018The Messiah of God.\u2019","saying
 \u2018The Son of Man must undergo great suffering
 and be rejected by the elders
 chief priests
 and scribes
 and be killed
 and on the third day be raised.\u2019","Then he said to them all
 \u2018If any want to become my followers
 let them deny themselves and take up their cross daily and follow me. ","For those who want to save their life will lose it
 and those who lose their life for my sake will save it. ","What does it profit them if they gain the whole world
 but lose or forfeit themselves? ","Those who are ashamed of me and of my words
 of them the Son of Man will be ashamed when he comes in his glory and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels. ","But truly I tell you
 there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God.\u2019","Just as they were leaving him
 Peter said to Jesus
 \u2018Master
 it is good for us to be here; let us make three dwellings
 one for you
 one for Moses

 \u2018You faithless and perverse generation
 how much longer must I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here.\u2019 ","\u2018Let these words sink into your ears: The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into human hands.\u2019","and said to them
 \u2018Whoever welcomes this child in my name welcomes me
 and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me; for the least among all of you is the greatest.\u2019","But Jesus said to him
 \u2018Do not stop him; for whoever is not against you is for you.\u2019","And Jesus said to him
 \u2018Foxes have holes
 and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.\u2019 ","To another he said
 \u2018Follow me.\u2019 But he said
 \u2018Lord
 first let me go and bury my father.\u2019 ","But Jesus said to him
 \u2018Let the dead bury their own dead; but as for you
 go and proclaim the kingdom of God.\u2019 ","Jesus said to him
 \u2018No one who puts a hand to the plough and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God.\u2019","He said to them
 \u2018The harvest is plentiful
 but the labourers are few; therefore ask the Lord of the harvest to send out labourers into his harvest. ","Go on your way. See
 I am sending you out like lambs into the midst of wolves. ","Carry no purse
 no bag
 no sandals; and greet no one on the road. ","Whatever house you enter
 first say
 \u201cPeace to this house!\u201d ","And if anyone is there who shares in peace
 your peace will rest on that person; but if not
 it will return to you. ","Remain in the same house
 eating and drinking whatever they provide
 for the labourer deserves to be paid. Do not move about from house to house. ","Whenever you enter a town and its people welcome you
 eat what is set before you; ","cure the sick who are there

 \u201cThe kingdom of God has come near to you.\u201d ","But whenever you enter a town and they do not welcome you
 go out into its streets and say
 ","\u201cEven the dust of your town that clings to our feet
 we wipe off in protest against you. Yet know this: the kingdom of God has come near.\u201d ","I tell you
 on that day it will be more tolerable for Sodom than for that town.","\u2018Woe to you
 Chorazin! Woe to you
 Bethsaida! For if the deeds of power done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon
 they would have repented long ago
 sitting in sackcloth and ashes. ","But at the judgement it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon than for you.","And you
 Capernaum
 will you be exalted to heaven? No
 you will be brought down to Hades.","\u2018Whoever listens to you listens to me
 and whoever rejects you rejects me
 and whoever rejects me rejects the one who sent me.\u2019","He said to them
 \u2018I watched Satan fall from heaven like a flash of lightning. ","See
 I have given you authority to tread on snakes and scorpions

 do not rejoice at this
 that the spirits submit to you
 but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.\u2019","At that same hour Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said

 Jesus said to them privately
 \u2018Blessed are the eyes that see what you see! ","For I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see what you see

 \u2018A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho

 beat him
 and went away
 leaving him half dead. ","Now by chance a priest was going down that road; and when he saw him
 he passed by on the other side. ","So likewise a Levite
 when he came to the place and saw him
 passed by on the other side. ","But a Samaritan while travelling came near him; and when he saw him
 he was moved with pity. ","He went to him and bandaged his wounds
 having poured oil and wine on them. Then he put him on his own animal
 brought him to an inn

 \u201cTake care of him; and when I come back
 I will repay you whatever more you spend.\u201d ","Which of these three
 do you think
 was a neighbour to the man who fell into the hands of the robbers?\u2019 ","He said
 \u2018The one who showed him mercy.\u2019 Jesus said to him

 for we ourselves forgive everyone indebted to us. And do not bring us to the time of trial.\u2019","And he said to them
 \u2018Suppose one of you has a friend
 and you go to him at midnight and say to him
 \u201cFriend
 lend me three loaves of bread; ","for a friend of mine has arrived
 and I have nothing to set before him.\u201d ","And he answers from within
 \u201cDo not bother me; the door has already been locked
 and my children are with me in bed; I cannot get up and give you anything.\u201d ","I tell you
 even though he will not get up and give him anything because he is his friend
 at least because of his persistence he will get up and give him whatever he needs.","\u2018So I say to you
 Ask
 and it will be given to you; search
 and you will find; knock
 and the door will be opened for you. ","For everyone who asks receives
 and everyone who searches finds
 and for everyone who knocks
 the door will be opened. ","Is there anyone among you who
 if your child asks for a fish
 will give a snake instead of a fish? ","Or if the child asks for an egg
 will give a scorpion? ","If you then
 who are evil
 know how to give good gifts to your children
 how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!\u2019","Now he was casting out a demon that was mute; when the demon had gone out
 the one who had been mute spoke
 and the crowds were amazed. ","But he knew what they were thinking and said to them
 \u2018Every kingdom divided against itself becomes a desert
 and house falls on house. ","If Satan also is divided against himself
 how will his kingdom stand? \u2014for you say that I cast out the demons by Beelzebul. ","Now if I cast out the demons by Beelzebul
 by whom do your exorcists cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges. ","But if it is by the finger of God that I cast out the demons
 then the kingdom of God has come to you. ","When a strong man
 fully armed
 guards his castle
 his property is safe. ","But when one stronger than he attacks him and overpowers him
 he takes away his armour in which he trusted and divides his plunder. ","Whoever is not with me is against me
 and whoever does not gather with me scatters.","\u2018When the unclean spirit has gone out of a person
 it wanders through waterless regions looking for a resting-place
 but not finding any
 it says
 \u201cI will return to my house from which I came.\u201d ","When it comes
 it finds it swept and put in order. ","Then it goes and brings seven other spirits more evil than itself
 and they enter and live there; and the last state of that person is worse than the first.\u2019","While he was saying this
 a woman in the crowd raised her voice and said to him
 \u2018Blessed is the womb that bore you and the breasts that nursed you!\u2019 ","But he said
 \u2018Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and obey it!\u2019","When the crowds were increasing
 he began to say
 \u2018This generation is an evil generation; it asks for a sign
 but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah. ","For just as Jonah became a sign to the people of Nineveh
 so the Son of Man will be to this generation. ","The queen of the South will rise at the judgement with the people of this generation and condemn them
 because she came from the ends of the earth to listen to the wisdom of Solomon
 and see
 something greater than Solomon is here! ","The people of Nineveh will rise up at the judgement with this generation and condemn it
 because they repented at the proclamation of Jonah
 and see
 something greater than Jonah is here!","\u2018No one after lighting a lamp puts it in a cellar
 but on the lampstand so that those who enter may see the light. ","Your eye is the lamp of your body. If your eye is healthy
 your whole body is full of light; but if it is not healthy
 your body is full of darkness. ","Therefore consider whether the light in you is not darkness.","If then your whole body is full of light
 with no part of it in darkness
 it will be as full of light as when a lamp gives you light with its rays.\u2019","Then the Lord said to him
 \u2018Now you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and of the dish
 but inside you are full of greed and wickedness. ","You fools! Did not the one who made the outside make the inside also?","So give for alms those things that are within; and see
 everything will be clean for you.","\u2018But woe to you Pharisees! For you tithe mint and rue and herbs of all kinds
 and neglect justice and the love of God; it is these you ought to have practised
 without neglecting the others. ","Woe to you Pharisees! For you love to have the seat of honour in the synagogues and to be greeted with respect in the market-places.","Woe to you! For you are like unmarked graves
 and people walk over them without realizing it.\u2019","And he said
 \u2018Woe also to you lawyers! For you load people with burdens hard to bear
 and you yourselves do not lift a finger to ease them. ","Woe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets whom your ancestors killed.","So you are witnesses and approve of the deeds of your ancestors; for they killed them
 and you build their tombs. ","Therefore also the Wisdom of God said
 \u201cI will send them prophets and apostles
 some of whom they will kill and persecute\u201d
 ","so that this generation may be charged with the blood of all the prophets shed since the foundation of the world
 ","from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah
 who perished between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes
 I tell you
 it will be charged against this generation. ","Woe to you lawyers! For you have taken away the key of knowledge; you did not enter yourselves
 and you hindered those who were entering.\u2019","Meanwhile
 when the crowd gathered in thousands
 so that they trampled on one another
 he began to speak first to his disciples
 \u2018Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees
 that is
 their hypocrisy. ","Nothing is covered up that will not be uncovered
 and nothing secret that will not become known. ","Therefore whatever you have said in the dark will be heard in the light
 and what you have whispered behind closed doors will be proclaimed from the housetops.","\u2018I tell you
 my friends
 do not fear those who kill the body
 and after that can do nothing more. ","But I will warn you whom to fear: fear him who
 after he has killed
 has authority to cast into hell. Yes
 I tell you
 fear him! ","Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? Yet not one of them is forgotten in God\u2019s sight.","But even the hairs of your head are all counted. Do not be afraid; you are of more value than many sparrows.","\u2018And I tell you
 everyone who acknowledges me before others
 the Son of Man also will acknowledge before the angels of God; ","but whoever denies me before others will be denied before the angels of God.","And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven; but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.","When they bring you before the synagogues
 the rulers
 and the authorities
 do not worry about how you are to defend yourselves or what you are to say; ","for the Holy Spirit will teach you at that very hour what you ought to say.\u2019","But he said to him
 \u2018Friend
 who set me to be a judge or arbitrator over you?\u2019 ","And he said to them
 \u2018Take care! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; for one\u2019s life does not consist in the abundance of possessions.\u2019 ","Then he told them a parable: \u2018The land of a rich man produced abundantly.","And he thought to himself
 \u201cWhat should I do
 for I have no place to store my crops?\u201d ","Then he said
 \u201cI will do this: I will pull down my barns and build larger ones
 and there I will store all my grain and my goods. ","And I will say to my soul
 Soul
 you have ample goods laid up for many years; relax
 eat
 drink
 be merry.\u201d ","But God said to him
 \u201cYou fool! This very night your life is being demanded of you. And the things you have prepared
 whose will they be?\u201d ","So it is with those who store up treasures for themselves but are not rich towards God.\u2019","He said to his disciples
 \u2018Therefore I tell you
 do not worry about your life
 what you will eat
 or about your body
 what you will wear. ","For life is more than food
 and the body more than clothing. ","Consider the ravens: they neither sow nor reap
 they have neither storehouse nor barn
 and yet God feeds them. Of how much more value are you than the birds! ","And can any of you by worrying add a single hour to your span of life?","If then you are not able to do so small a thing as that
 why do you worry about the rest? ","Consider the lilies
 how they grow: they neither toil nor spin; yet I tell you
 even Solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these. ","But if God so clothes the grass of the field
 which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven
 how much more will he clothe you\u2014you of little faith! ","And do not keep striving for what you are to eat and what you are to drink
 and do not keep worrying. ","For it is the nations of the world that strive after all these things
 and your Father knows that you need them. ","Instead
 strive for his kingdom
 and these things will be given to you as well.","\u2018Do not be afraid
 little flock
 for it is your Father\u2019s good pleasure to give you the kingdom. ","Sell your possessions
 and give alms. Make purses for yourselves that do not wear out
 an unfailing treasure in heaven
 where no thief comes near and no moth destroys. ","For where your treasure is
 there your heart will be also.","\u2018Be dressed for action and have your lamps lit;","be like those who are waiting for their master to return from the wedding banquet
 so that they may open the door for him as soon as he comes and knocks. ","Blessed are those slaves whom the master finds alert when he comes; truly I tell you
 he will fasten his belt and have them sit down to eat
 and he will come and serve them. ","If he comes during the middle of the night
 or near dawn
 and finds them so
 blessed are those slaves.","\u2018But know this: if the owner of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming
 he would not have let his house be broken into. ","You also must be ready
 for the Son of Man is coming at an unexpected hour.\u2019","And the Lord said
 \u2018Who then is the faithful and prudent manager whom his master will put in charge of his slaves
 to give them their allowance of food at the proper time? ","Blessed is that slave whom his master will find at work when he arrives.","Truly I tell you
 he will put that one in charge of all his possessions. ","But if that slave says to himself
 \u201cMy master is delayed in coming\u201d
 and if he begins to beat the other slaves
 men and women
 and to eat and drink and get drunk
 ","the master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour that he does not know
 and will cut him in pieces
 and put him with the unfaithful. ","That slave who knew what his master wanted
 but did not prepare himself or do what was wanted
 will receive a severe beating. ","But one who did not know and did what deserved a beating will receive a light beating. From everyone to whom much has been given
 much will be required; and from one to whom much has been entrusted
 even more will be demanded.","\u2018I came to bring fire to the earth
 and how I wish it were already kindled! ","I have a baptism with which to be baptized
 and what stress I am under until it is completed! ","Do you think that I have come to bring peace to the earth? No
 I tell you
 but rather division! ","From now on
 five in one household will be divided
 three against two and two against three; ","they will be divided: father against son and son against father
 mother against daughter and daughter against mother
 mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.\u2019","He also said to the crowds
 \u2018When you see a cloud rising in the west
 you immediately say
 \u201cIt is going to rain\u201d; and so it happens. ","And when you see the south wind blowing
 you say
 \u201cThere will be scorching heat\u201d; and it happens. ","You hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of earth and sky
 but why do you not know how to interpret the present time?","\u2018And why do you not judge for yourselves what is right?","Thus
 when you go with your accuser before a magistrate
 on the way make an effort to settle the case
 or you may be dragged before the judge
 and the judge hand you over to the officer
 and the officer throw you in prison. ","I tell you
 you will never get out until you have paid the very last penny.\u2019","He asked them
 \u2018Do you think that because these Galileans suffered in this way they were worse sinners than all other Galileans? ","No
 I tell you; but unless you repent
 you will all perish as they did. ","Or those eighteen who were killed when the tower of Siloam fell on them\u2014do you think that they were worse offenders than all the others living in Jerusalem?","No
 I tell you; but unless you repent
 you will all perish just as they did.\u2019","Then he told this parable: \u2018A man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came looking for fruit on it and found none.","So he said to the gardener
 \u201cSee here! For three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree
 and still I find none. Cut it down! Why should it be wasting the soil?\u201d ","He replied
 \u201cSir
 let it alone for one more year
 until I dig round it and put manure on it. ","If it bears fruit next year
 well and good; but if not
 you can cut it down.\u201d\u2019","When Jesus saw her
 he called her over and said
 \u2018Woman
 you are set free from your ailment.\u2019 ","But the Lord answered him and said
 \u2018You hypocrites! Does not each of you on the sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from the manger
 and lead it away to give it water? ","And ought not this woman
 a daughter of Abraham whom Satan bound for eighteen long years
 be set free from this bondage on the sabbath day?\u2019 ","He said therefore
 \u2018What is the kingdom of God like? And to what should I compare it? ","It is like a mustard seed that someone took and sowed in the garden; it grew and became a tree
 and the birds of the air made nests in its branches.\u2019","And again he said
 \u2018To what should I compare the kingdom of God? ","It is like yeast that a woman took and mixed in with three measures of flour until all of it was leavened.\u2019","Someone asked him
 \u2018Lord
 will only a few be saved?\u2019 He said to them
 ","\u2018Strive to enter through the narrow door; for many
 I tell you
 will try to enter and will not be able. ","When once the owner of the house has got up and shut the door
 and you begin to stand outside and to knock at the door
 saying
 \u201cLord
 open to us\u201d
 then in reply he will say to you
 \u201cI do not know where you come from.\u201d ","Then you will begin to say
 \u201cWe ate and drank with you
 and you taught in our streets.\u201d ","But he will say
 \u201cI do not know where you come from; go away from me
 all you evildoers!\u201d ","There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God
 and you yourselves thrown out. ","Then people will come from east and west
 from north and south
 and will eat in the kingdom of God. ","Indeed
 some are last who will be first
 and some are first who will be last.\u2019","He said to them
 \u2018Go and tell that fox for me
 \u201cListen
 I am casting out demons and performing cures today and tomorrow
 and on the third day I finish my work. ","Yet today
 tomorrow
 and the next day I must be on my way
 because it is impossible for a prophet to be killed away from Jerusalem.\u201d ","Jerusalem
 Jerusalem
 the city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it! How often have I desired to gather your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings
 and you were not willing! ","See
 your house is left to you. And I tell you
 you will not see me until the time comes when you say
 \u201cBlessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord.\u201d\u2019","And Jesus asked the lawyers and Pharisees
 \u2018Is it lawful to cure people on the sabbath
 or not?\u2019 ","Then he said to them
 \u2018If one of you has a child or an ox that has fallen into a well
 will you not immediately pull it out on a sabbath day?\u2019 ","\u2018When you are invited by someone to a wedding banquet
 do not sit down at the place of honour
 in case someone more distinguished than you has been invited by your host; ","and the host who invited both of you may come and say to you
 \u201cGive this person your place\u201d
 and then in disgrace you would start to take the lowest place. ","But when you are invited
 go and sit down at the lowest place
 so that when your host comes
 he may say to you
 \u201cFriend
 move up higher\u201d; then you will be honoured in the presence of all who sit at the table with you. ","For all who exalt themselves will be humbled
 and those who humble themselves will be exalted.\u2019","He said also to the one who had invited him
 \u2018When you give a luncheon or a dinner
 do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbours
 in case they may invite you in return
 and you would be repaid. ","But when you give a banquet
 invite the poor
 the crippled
 the lame
 and the blind. ","And you will be blessed
 because they cannot repay you
 for you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.\u2019","One of the dinner guests
 on hearing this
 said to him
 \u2018Blessed is anyone who will eat bread in the kingdom of God!\u2019 ","Then Jesus said to him
 \u2018Someone gave a great dinner and invited many. ","At the time for the dinner he sent his slave to say to those who had been invited
 \u201cCome; for everything is ready now.\u201d ","But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said to him
 \u201cI have bought a piece of land
 and I must go out and see it; please accept my apologies.\u201d ","Another said
 \u201cI have bought five yoke of oxen
 and I am going to try them out; please accept my apologies.\u201d ","Another said
 \u201cI have just been married
 and therefore I cannot come.\u201d ","So the slave returned and reported this to his master. Then the owner of the house became angry and said to his slave
 \u201cGo out at once into the streets and lanes of the town and bring in the poor
 the crippled
 the blind
 and the lame.\u201d ","And the slave said
 \u201cSir
 what you ordered has been done
 and there is still room.\u201d ","Then the master said to the slave
 \u201cGo out into the roads and lanes
 and compel people to come in
 so that my house may be filled. ","For I tell you
 none of those who were invited will taste my dinner.\u201d\u2019","Now large crowds were travelling with him; and he turned and said to them
 ","\u2018Whoever comes to me and does not hate father and mother
 wife and children
 brothers and sisters
 yes
 and even life itself
 cannot be my disciple. ","Whoever does not carry the cross and follow me cannot be my disciple.","For which of you
 intending to build a tower
 does not first sit down and estimate the cost
 to see whether he has enough to complete it? ","Otherwise
 when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish
 all who see it will begin to ridicule him
 ","saying
 \u201cThis fellow began to build and was not able to finish.\u201d ","Or what king
 going out to wage war against another king
 will not sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to oppose the one who comes against him with twenty thousand? ","If he cannot
 then
 while the other is still far away
 he sends a delegation and asks for the terms of peace. ","So therefore
 none of you can become my disciple if you do not give up all your possessions.","\u2018Salt is good; but if salt has lost its taste
 how can its saltiness be restored? ","It is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure heap; they throw it away. Let anyone with ears to hear listen!\u2019","\u2018Which one of you
 having a hundred sheep and losing one of them
 does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go after the one that is lost until he finds it? ","When he has found it
 he lays it on his shoulders and rejoices. ","And when he comes home
 he calls together his friends and neighbours
 saying to them
 \u201cRejoice with me
 for I have found my sheep that was lost.\u201d ","Just so
 I tell you
 there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous people who need no repentance.","\u2018Or what woman having ten silver coins
 if she loses one of them
 does not light a lamp
 sweep the house
 and search carefully until she finds it? ","When she has found it
 she calls together her friends and neighbours
 saying
 \u201cRejoice with me
 for I have found the coin that I had lost.\u201d ","Just so
 I tell you
 there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.\u2019","Then Jesus said
 \u2018There was a man who had two sons. ","The younger of them said to his father
 \u201cFather
 give me the share of the property that will belong to me.\u201d So he divided his property between them. ","A few days later the younger son gathered all he had and travelled to a distant country
 and there he squandered his property in dissolute living. ","When he had spent everything
 a severe famine took place throughout that country
 and he began to be in need. ","So he went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country
 who sent him to his fields to feed the pigs. ","He would gladly have filled himself with the pods that the pigs were eating; and no one gave him anything.","But when he came to himself he said
 \u201cHow many of my father\u2019s hired hands have bread enough and to spare
 but here I am dying of hunger! ","I will get up and go to my father
 and I will say to him
 \u2018Father
 I have sinned against heaven and before you; ","I am no longer worthy to be called your son; treat me like one of your hired hands.\u2019\u201d","So he set off and went to his father. But while he was still far off
 his father saw him and was filled with compassion; he ran and put his arms around him and kissed him. ","Then the son said to him
 \u201cFather
 I have sinned against heaven and before you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son.\u201d ","But the father said to his slaves
 \u201cQuickly
 bring out a robe\u2014the best one\u2014and put it on him; put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. ","And get the fatted calf and kill it
 and let us eat and celebrate; ","for this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found!\u201d And they began to celebrate.","\u2018Now his elder son was in the field; and when he came and approached the house
 he heard music and dancing. ","He called one of the slaves and asked what was going on.","He replied
 \u201cYour brother has come
 and your father has killed the fatted calf
 because he has got him back safe and sound.\u201d ","Then he became angry and refused to go in. His father came out and began to plead with him.","But he answered his father
 \u201cListen! For all these years I have been working like a slave for you
 and I have never disobeyed your command; yet you have never given me even a young goat so that I might celebrate with my friends. ","But when this son of yours came back
 who has devoured your property with prostitutes
 you killed the fatted calf for him!\u201d ","Then the father said to him
 \u201cSon
 you are always with me
 and all that is mine is yours. ","But we had to celebrate and rejoice
 because this brother of yours was dead and has come to life; he was lost and has been found.\u201d\u2019","Then Jesus said to the disciples
 \u2018There was a rich man who had a manager
 and charges were brought to him that this man was squandering his property. ","So he summoned him and said to him
 \u201cWhat is this that I hear about you? Give me an account of your management
 because you cannot be my manager any longer.\u201d ","Then the manager said to himself
 \u201cWhat will I do
 now that my master is taking the position away from me? I am not strong enough to dig
 and I am ashamed to beg. ","I have decided what to do so that
 when I am dismissed as manager
 people may welcome me into their homes.\u201d ","So
 summoning his master\u2019s debtors one by one
 he asked the first
 \u201cHow much do you owe my master?\u201d ","He answered
 \u201cA hundred jugs of olive oil.\u201d He said to him
 \u201cTake your bill
 sit down quickly
 and make it fifty.\u201d ","Then he asked another
 \u201cAnd how much do you owe?\u201d He replied
 \u201cA hundred containers of wheat.\u201d He said to him
 \u201cTake your bill and make it eighty.\u201d ","And his master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly; for the children of this age are more shrewd in dealing with their own generation than are the children of light.","And I tell you
 make friends for yourselves by means of dishonest wealth so that when it is gone
 they may welcome you into the eternal homes.","\u2018Whoever is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much; and whoever is dishonest in a very little is dishonest also in much.","If then you have not been faithful with the dishonest wealth
 who will entrust to you the true riches? ","And if you have not been faithful with what belongs to another
 who will give you what is your own? ","No slave can serve two masters; for a slave will either hate the one and love the other
 or be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth.\u2019","So he said to them
 \u2018You are those who justify yourselves in the sight of others; but God knows your hearts; for what is prized by human beings is an abomination in the sight of God.","\u2018The law and the prophets were in effect until John came; since then the good news of the kingdom of God is proclaimed
 and everyone tries to enter it by force. ","But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away
 than for one stroke of a letter in the law to be dropped.","\u2018Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery
 and whoever marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery.","\u2018There was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and who feasted sumptuously every day.","And at his gate lay a poor man named Lazarus
 covered with sores
 ","who longed to satisfy his hunger with what fell from the rich man\u2019s table; even the dogs would come and lick his sores.","The poor man died and was carried away by the angels to be with Abraham. The rich man also died and was buried.","In Hades
 where he was being tormented
 he looked up and saw Abraham far away with Lazarus by his side. ","He called out
 \u201cFather Abraham
 have mercy on me
 and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue; for I am in agony in these flames.\u201d ","But Abraham said
 \u201cChild
 remember that during your lifetime you received your good things
 and Lazarus in like manner evil things; but now he is comforted here
 and you are in agony. ","Besides all this
 between you and us a great chasm has been fixed
 so that those who might want to pass from here to you cannot do so
 and no one can cross from there to us.\u201d ","He said
 \u201cThen
 father
 I beg you to send him to my father\u2019s house\u2014 ","for I have five brothers\u2014that he may warn them
 so that they will not also come into this place of torment.\u201d ","Abraham replied
 \u201cThey have Moses and the prophets; they should listen to them.\u201d ","He said
 \u201cNo
 father Abraham; but if someone goes to them from the dead
 they will repent.\u201d ","He said to him
 \u201cIf they do not listen to Moses and the prophets
 neither will they be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.\u201d\u2019","Jesus said to his disciples
 \u2018Occasions for stumbling are bound to come
 but woe to anyone by whom they come! ","It would be better for you if a millstone were hung around your neck and you were thrown into the sea than for you to cause one of these little ones to stumble.","Be on your guard! If another disciple sins
 you must rebuke the offender
 and if there is repentance
 you must forgive. ","And if the same person sins against you seven times a day
 and turns back to you seven times and says
 \u201cI repent\u201d
 you must forgive.\u2019","The Lord replied
 \u2018If you had faith the size of a mustard seed
 you could say to this mulberry tree
 \u201cBe uprooted and planted in the sea\u201d
 and it would obey you.","\u2018Who among you would say to your slave who has just come in from ploughing or tending sheep in the field
 \u201cCome here at once and take your place at the table\u201d? ","Would you not rather say to him
 \u201cPrepare supper for me
 put on your apron and serve me while I eat and drink; later you may eat and drink\u201d? ","Do you thank the slave for doing what was commanded?","So you also
 when you have done all that you were ordered to do
 say
 \u201cWe are worthless slaves; we have done only what we ought to have done!\u201d\u2019","On the way to Jerusalem Jesus was going through the region between Samaria and Galilee.","When he saw them
 he said to them
 \u2018Go and show yourselves to the priests.\u2019 And as they went
 they were made clean. ","Then Jesus asked
 \u2018Were not ten made clean? But the other nine
 where are they? ","Was none of them found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?\u2019","Then he said to him
 \u2018Get up and go on your way; your faith has made you well.\u2019","Once Jesus was asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God was coming
 and he answered
 \u2018The kingdom of God is not coming with things that can be observed; ","nor will they say
 \u201cLook
 here it is!\u201d or \u201cThere it is!\u201d For
 in fact
 the kingdom of God is among you.\u2019","Then he said to the disciples
 \u2018The days are coming when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man
 and you will not see it. ","They will say to you
 \u201cLook there!\u201d or \u201cLook here!\u201d Do not go
 do not set off in pursuit. ","For as the lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one side to the other
 so will the Son of Man be in his day. ","But first he must endure much suffering and be rejected by this generation.","Just as it was in the days of Noah
 so too it will be in the days of the Son of Man. ","They were eating and drinking
 and marrying and being given in marriage
 until the day Noah entered the ark
 and the flood came and destroyed all of them. ","Likewise
 just as it was in the days of Lot: they were eating and drinking
 buying and selling
 planting and building
 ","but on the day that Lot left Sodom
 it rained fire and sulphur from heaven and destroyed all of them ","\u2014it will be like that on the day that the Son of Man is revealed.","On that day
 anyone on the housetop who has belongings in the house must not come down to take them away; and likewise anyone in the field must not turn back. ","Remember Lot\u2019s wife.","Those who try to make their life secure will lose it
 but those who lose their life will keep it. ","I tell you
 on that night there will be two in one bed; one will be taken and the other left. ","There will be two women grinding meal together; one will be taken and the other left.\u2019","Then they asked him
 \u2018Where
 Lord?\u2019 He said to them
 \u2018Where the corpse is
 there the vultures will gather.\u2019","He said
 \u2018In a certain city there was a judge who neither feared God nor had respect for people. ","In that city there was a widow who kept coming to him and saying
 \u201cGrant me justice against my opponent.\u201d ","For a while he refused; but later he said to himself
 \u201cThough I have no fear of God and no respect for anyone
 ","yet because this widow keeps bothering me
 I will grant her justice
 so that she may not wear me out by continually coming.\u201d\u2019 ","And the Lord said
 \u2018Listen to what the unjust judge says. ","And will not God grant justice to his chosen ones who cry to him day and night? Will he delay long in helping them?","I tell you
 he will quickly grant justice to them. And yet
 when the Son of Man comes
 will he find faith on earth?\u2019","\u2018Two men went up to the temple to pray
 one a Pharisee and the other a tax-collector. ","The Pharisee
 standing by himself
 was praying thus
 \u201cGod
 I thank you that I am not like other people: thieves
 rogues
 adulterers
 or even like this tax-collector. ","I fast twice a week; I give a tenth of all my income.\u201d","But the tax-collector
 standing far off
 would not even look up to heaven
 but was beating his breast and saying
 \u201cGod
 be merciful to me
 a sinner!\u201d ","I tell you
 this man went down to his home justified rather than the other; for all who exalt themselves will be humbled
 but all who humble themselves will be exalted.\u2019","But Jesus called for them and said
 \u2018Let the little children come to me
 and do not stop them; for it is to such as these that the kingdom of God belongs. ","Truly I tell you
 whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will never enter it.\u2019","Jesus said to him
 \u2018Why do you call me good? No one is good but God alone. ","You know the commandments: \u201cYou shall not commit adultery; You shall not murder; You shall not steal; You shall not bear false witness; Honour your father and mother.\u201d\u2019","He replied
 \u2018I have kept all these since my youth.\u2019 ","When Jesus heard this
 he said to him
 \u2018There is still one thing lacking. Sell all that you own and distribute the money to the poor
 and you will have treasure in heaven; then come
 follow me.\u2019 ","Jesus looked at him and said
 \u2018How hard it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God! ","Indeed
 it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.\u2019","He replied
 \u2018What is impossible for mortals is possible for God.\u2019","And he said to them
 \u2018Truly I tell you
 there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children
 for the sake of the kingdom of God
 ","who will not get back very much more in this age
 and in the age to come eternal life.\u2019","Then he took the twelve aside and said to them
 \u2018See
 we are going up to Jerusalem
 and everything that is written about the Son of Man by the prophets will be accomplished. ","For he will be handed over to the Gentiles; and he will be mocked and insulted and spat upon.","After they have flogged him
 they will kill him
 and on the third day he will rise again.\u2019 ","But they understood nothing about all these things; in fact
 what he said was hidden from them
 and they did not grasp what was said.","\u2018What do you want me to do for you?\u2019 He said
 \u2018Lord
 let me see again.\u2019 ","Jesus said to him
 \u2018Receive your sight; your faith has saved you.\u2019 ","When Jesus came to the place
 he looked up and said to him
 \u2018Zacchaeus
 hurry and come down; for I must stay at your house today.\u2019 ","Zacchaeus stood there and said to the Lord
 \u2018Look
 half of my possessions
 Lord
 I will give to the poor; and if I have defrauded anyone of anything
 I will pay back four times as much.\u2019 ","Then Jesus said to him
 \u2018Today salvation has come to this house
 because he too is a son of Abraham. ","For the Son of Man came to seek out and to save the lost.\u2019","So he said
 \u2018A nobleman went to a distant country to get royal power for himself and then return. ","He summoned ten of his slaves
 and gave them ten pounds
 and said to them
 \u201cDo business with these until I come back.\u201d ","But the citizens of his country hated him and sent a delegation after him
 saying
 \u201cWe do not want this man to rule over us.\u201d ","When he returned
 having received royal power
 he ordered these slaves
 to whom he had given the money
 to be summoned so that he might find out what they had gained by trading. ","The first came forward and said
 \u201cLord
 your pound has made ten more pounds.\u201d ","He said to him
 \u201cWell done
 good slave! Because you have been trustworthy in a very small thing
 take charge of ten cities.\u201d ","Then the second came
 saying
 \u201cLord
 your pound has made five pounds.\u201d ","He said to him
 \u201cAnd you
 rule over five cities.\u201d ","Then the other came
 saying
 \u201cLord
 here is your pound. I wrapped it up in a piece of cloth
 ","for I was afraid of you
 because you are a harsh man; you take what you did not deposit
 and reap what you did not sow.\u201d ","He said to him
 \u201cI will judge you by your own words
 you wicked slave! You knew
 did you
 that I was a harsh man
 taking what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not sow? ","Why then did you not put my money into the bank? Then when I returned
 I could have collected it with interest.\u201d ","He said to the bystanders
 \u201cTake the pound from him and give it to the one who has ten pounds.\u201d ","(And they said to him
 \u201cLord
 he has ten pounds!\u201d) ","\u201cI tell you
 to all those who have
 more will be given; but from those who have nothing
 even what they have will be taken away. ","But as for these enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them\u2014bring them here and slaughter them in my presence.\u201d\u2019","saying
 \u2018Go into the village ahead of you
 and as you enter it you will find tied there a colt that has never been ridden. Untie it and bring it here. ","If anyone asks you
 \u201cWhy are you untying it?\u201d just say this: \u201cThe Lord needs it.\u201d\u2019 ","Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him
 \u2018Teacher
 order your disciples to stop.\u2019 ","He answered
 \u2018I tell you
 if these were silent
 the stones would shout out.\u2019","saying
 \u2018If you
 even you
 had only recognized on this day the things that make for peace! But now they are hidden from your eyes. ","Indeed
 the days will come upon you
 when your enemies will set up ramparts around you and surround you
 and hem you in on every side. ","They will crush you to the ground
 you and your children within you
 and they will not leave within you one stone upon another; because you did not recognize the time of your visitation from God.\u2019","and he said
 \u2018It is written
 \u201cMy house shall be a house of prayer\u201d; but you have made it a den of robbers.\u2019","He answered them
 \u2018I will also ask you a question
 and you tell me: ","Did the baptism of John come from heaven
 or was it of human origin?\u2019 ","Then Jesus said to them
 \u2018Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.\u2019","He began to tell the people this parable: \u2018A man planted a vineyard
 and leased it to tenants
 and went to another country for a long time. ","When the season came
 he sent a slave to the tenants in order that they might give him his share of the produce of the vineyard; but the tenants beat him and sent him away empty-handed. ","Next he sent another slave; that one also they beat and insulted and sent away empty-handed.","And he sent yet a third; this one also they wounded and threw out.","Then the owner of the vineyard said
 \u201cWhat shall I do? I will send my beloved son; perhaps they will respect him.\u201d ","But when the tenants saw him
 they discussed it among themselves and said
 \u201cThis is the heir; let us kill him so that the inheritance may be ours.\u201d ","So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?","He will come and destroy those tenants and give the vineyard to others.\u2019 When they heard this
 they said
 \u2018Heaven forbid!\u2019 ","But he looked at them and said
 \u2018What then does this text mean: \u201cThe stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone\u201d?","Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces; and it will crush anyone on whom it falls.\u2019","So they watched him and sent spies who pretended to be honest
 in order to trap him by what he said
 so as to hand him over to the jurisdiction and authority of the governor. ","\u2018Show me a denarius. Whose head and whose title does it bear?\u2019 They said
 \u2018The emperor\u2019s.\u2019 ","He said to them
 \u2018Then give to the emperor the things that are the emperor\u2019s
 and to God the things that are God\u2019s.\u2019 ","And they were not able in the presence of the people to trap him by what he said; and being amazed by his answer
 they became silent.","Jesus said to them
 \u2018Those who belong to this age marry and are given in marriage; ","but those who are considered worthy of a place in that age and in the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage.","Indeed they cannot die any more
 because they are like angels and are children of God
 being children of the resurrection. ","And the fact that the dead are raised Moses himself showed
 in the story about the bush
 where he speaks of the Lord as the God of Abraham
 the God of Isaac
 and the God of Jacob. ","Now he is God not of the dead
 but of the living; for to him all of them are alive.\u2019 ","Then he said to them
 \u2018How can they say that the Messiah is David\u2019s son? ","For David himself says in the book of Psalms
 \u201cThe Lord said to my Lord
 \u2018Sit at my right hand
","until I make your enemies your footstool.\u2019\u201d","David thus calls him Lord; so how can he be his son?\u2019","\u2018Beware of the scribes
 who like to walk around in long robes
 and love to be greeted with respect in the market-places
 and to have the best seats in the synagogues and places of honour at banquets. ","They devour widows\u2019 houses and for the sake of appearance say long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation.\u2019","He said
 \u2018Truly I tell you
 this poor widow has put in more than all of them; ","for all of them have contributed out of their abundance
 but she out of her poverty has put in all she had to live on.\u2019","\u2018As for these things that you see
 the days will come when not one stone will be left upon another; all will be thrown down.\u2019","And he said
 \u2018Beware that you are not led astray; for many will come in my name and say
 \u201cI am he!\u201d and
 \u201cThe time is near!\u201d Do not go after them.","\u2018When you hear of wars and insurrections
 do not be terrified; for these things must take place first
 but the end will not follow immediately.\u2019 ","Then he said to them
 \u2018Nation will rise against nation
 and kingdom against kingdom; ","there will be great earthquakes
 and in various places famines and plagues; and there will be dreadful portents and great signs from heaven.","\u2018But before all this occurs
 they will arrest you and persecute you; they will hand you over to synagogues and prisons
 and you will be brought before kings and governors because of my name. ","This will give you an opportunity to testify.","So make up your minds not to prepare your defence in advance;","for I will give you words and a wisdom that none of your opponents will be able to withstand or contradict.","You will be betrayed even by parents and brothers
 by relatives and friends; and they will put some of you to death. ","You will be hated by all because of my name.","But not a hair of your head will perish.","By your endurance you will gain your souls.","\u2018When you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies
 then know that its desolation has come near. ","Then those in Judea must flee to the mountains
 and those inside the city must leave it
 and those out in the country must not enter it; ","for these are days of vengeance
 as a fulfilment of all that is written. ","Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing infants in those days! For there will be great distress on the earth and wrath against this people;","they will fall by the edge of the sword and be taken away as captives among all nations; and Jerusalem will be trampled on by the Gentiles
 until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.","\u2018There will be signs in the sun
 the moon
 and the stars
 and on the earth distress among nations confused by the roaring of the sea and the waves. ","People will faint from fear and foreboding of what is coming upon the world
 for the powers of the heavens will be shaken. ","Then they will see \u201cthe Son of Man coming in a cloud\u201d with power and great glory.","Now when these things begin to take place
 stand up and raise your heads
 because your redemption is drawing near.\u2019","Then he told them a parable: \u2018Look at the fig tree and all the trees;","as soon as they sprout leaves you can see for yourselves and know that summer is already near.","So also
 when you see these things taking place
 you know that the kingdom of God is near. ","Truly I tell you
 this generation will not pass away until all things have taken place. ","Heaven and earth will pass away
 but my words will not pass away.","\u2018Be on guard so that your hearts are not weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and the worries of this life
 and that day does not catch you unexpectedly
 ","like a trap. For it will come upon all who live on the face of the whole earth.","Be alert at all times
 praying that you may have the strength to escape all these things that will take place
 and to stand before the Son of Man.\u2019","So Jesus sent Peter and John
 saying
 \u2018Go and prepare the Passover meal for us that we may eat it.\u2019 ","\u2018Listen
\u2019 he said to them
 \u2018when you have entered the city
 a man carrying a jar of water will meet you; follow him into the house he enters ","and say to the owner of the house
 \u201cThe teacher asks you
 \u2018Where is the guest room
 where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?\u2019\u201d ","He will show you a large room upstairs
 already furnished. Make preparations for us there.\u2019 ","He said to them
 \u2018I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer; ","for I tell you
 I will not eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.\u2019 ","Then he took a cup
 and after giving thanks he said
 \u2018Take this and divide it among yourselves; ","for I tell you that from now on I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.\u2019","Then he took a loaf of bread
 and when he had given thanks
 he broke it and gave it to them
 saying
 \u2018This is my body
 which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me.\u2019 ","And he did the same with the cup after supper
 saying
 \u2018This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood. ","But see
 the one who betrays me is with me
 and his hand is on the table. ","For the Son of Man is going as it has been determined
 but woe to that one by whom he is betrayed!\u2019 ","But he said to them
 \u2018The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and those in authority over them are called benefactors. ","But not so with you; rather the greatest among you must become like the youngest
 and the leader like one who serves. ","For who is greater
 the one who is at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one at the table? But I am among you as one who serves.","\u2018You are those who have stood by me in my trials;","and I confer on you
 just as my Father has conferred on me
 a kingdom
 ","so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom
 and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.","\u2018Simon
 Simon
 listen! Satan has demanded to sift all of you like wheat
 ","but I have prayed for you that your own faith may not fail; and you
 when once you have turned back
 strengthen your brothers.\u2019 ","And he said to him
 \u2018Lord
 I am ready to go with you to prison and to death!\u2019 ","Jesus said
 \u2018I tell you
 Peter
 the cock will not crow this day
 until you have denied three times that you know me.\u2019","He said to them
 \u2018When I sent you out without a purse
 bag
 or sandals
 did you lack anything?\u2019 They said
 \u2018No
 not a thing.\u2019 ","He said to them
 \u2018But now
 the one who has a purse must take it
 and likewise a bag. And the one who has no sword must sell his cloak and buy one. ","For I tell you
 this scripture must be fulfilled in me
 \u201cAnd he was counted among the lawless\u201d; and indeed what is written about me is being fulfilled.\u2019 ","They said
 \u2018Lord
 look
 here are two swords.\u2019 He replied
 \u2018It is enough.\u2019","When he reached the place
 he said to them
 \u2018Pray that you may not come into the time of trial.\u2019 ","\u2018Father
 if you are willing
 remove this cup from me; yet
 not my will but yours be done.\u2019 ","and he said to them
 \u2018Why are you sleeping? Get up and pray that you may not come into the time of trial.\u2019","but Jesus said to him
 \u2018Judas
 is it with a kiss that you are betraying the Son of Man?\u2019 ","But Jesus said
 \u2018No more of this!\u2019 And he touched his ear and healed him. ","Then Jesus said to the chief priests
 the officers of the temple police
 and the elders who had come for him
 \u2018Have you come out with swords and clubs as if I were a bandit? ","When I was with you day after day in the temple
 you did not lay hands on me. But this is your hour
 and the power of darkness!\u2019","The Lord turned and looked at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word of the Lord
 how he had said to him
 \u2018Before the cock crows today
 you will deny me three times.\u2019 ","They said
 \u2018If you are the Messiah
 tell us.\u2019 He replied
 \u2018If I tell you
 you will not believe; ","and if I question you
 you will not answer. ","But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.\u2019","All of them asked
 \u2018Are you
 then
 the Son of God?\u2019 He said to them
 \u2018You say that I am.\u2019 ","Then Pilate asked him
 \u2018Are you the king of the Jews?\u2019 He answered
 \u2018You say so.\u2019 ","When Pilate heard this
 he asked whether the man was a Galilean. ","and said to them
 \u2018You brought me this man as one who was perverting the people; and here I have examined him in your presence and have not found this man guilty of any of your charges against him. ","A third time he said to them
 \u2018Why
 what evil has he done? I have found in him no ground for the sentence of death; I will therefore have him flogged and then release him.\u2019 ","But Jesus turned to them and said
 \u2018Daughters of Jerusalem
 do not weep for me
 but weep for yourselves and for your children. ","For the days are surely coming when they will say
 \u201cBlessed are the barren
 and the wombs that never bore
 and the breasts that never nursed.\u201d ","Then they will begin to say to the mountains
 \u201cFall on us\u201d; and to the hills
 \u201cCover us.\u201d ","For if they do this when the wood is green
 what will happen when it is dry?\u2019","Then Jesus said
 \u2018Father
 forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing.\u2019]] And they cast lots to divide his clothing. ","He replied
 \u2018Truly I tell you
 today you will be with me in Paradise.\u2019","Then Jesus
 crying with a loud voice
 said
 \u2018Father
 into your hands I commend my spirit.\u2019 Having said this
 he breathed his last. ","The women were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground

 \u2018Why do you look for the living among the dead? He is not here
 but has risen. ","And he said to them
 \u2018What are you discussing with each other while you walk along?\u2019 They stood still
 looking sad. ","He asked them
 \u2018What things?\u2019 They replied
 \u2018The things about Jesus of Nazareth
 who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people
 ","Then he said to them
 \u2018Oh
 how foolish you are
 and how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have declared! ","Was it not necessary that the Messiah should suffer these things and then enter into his glory?\u2019","While they were talking about this
 Jesus himself stood among them and said to them
 \u2018Peace be with you.\u2019 ","He said to them
 \u2018Why are you frightened
 and why do doubts arise in your hearts? ","Look at my hands and my feet; see that it is I myself. Touch me and see; for a ghost does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have.\u2019","While in their joy they were disbelieving and still wondering
 he said to them
 \u2018Have you anything here to eat?\u2019 ","Then he said to them
 \u2018These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you\u2014that everything written about me in the law of Moses
 the prophets

 \u2018Thus it is written

 I am sending upon you what my Father promised; so stay here in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high.\u2019","\u2018Why were you looking for me?\u2019 he replied. \u2018Didn\u2019t you know that I would have to be getting involved with my father\u2019s work?\u2019","\u2018It is written

 in your own country!\u201d","\u2018Let me tell you the truth
\u2019 he went on. \u2018Prophets never get accepted in their own country. ","This is the solemn truth: there were plenty of widows in Israel in the time of Elijah
 when heaven was shut up for three years and six months
 and there was a great famine over all the land. ","Elijah was sent to none of them
 only to a widow in the Sidonian town of Zarephath.","\u2018And there were plenty of people with virulent skin diseases in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet

 the Syrian.\u2019","They were astonished at his teaching
 because his message was powerful and authoritative.","\u2018Shut up!\u2019 Jesus rebuked him. \u2018Come out of him!\u2019 The demon threw the man down right there in front of them
 and came out without harming him.","Demons came out of many people
 shouting out
 \u2018You are the son of God!\u2019 He sternly forbade them to speak
 because they knew he was the Messiah.","\u2018I must tell the good news of God\u2019s kingdom to the other towns

 he said to Simon
 \u2018Put out into the deeper part
 and let down your nets for a catch.\u2019","this included James and John

 no good tree bears bad fruit; nor can a bad tree produce good fruit. ","Every tree is known by its fruit.

 \u201cLord
 Lord
\u201d and don\u2019t do what I say? ","I\u2019ll show you what people are like when they come to me
 and hear my words

 he went down deep
 and he laid a foundation on rock. When a flood came
 the river burst its banks all over the house

\u2019 he said
 turning to the crowd that was following him
 \u2018I haven\u2019t found faith of this kind
 even in Israel.\u2019","When the master saw her
 he was very sorry for her. \u2018Don\u2019t cry
\u2019 he said to her. ","Then he went up and touched the bier
 and the people carrying it stood still. \u2018Young fellow
\u2019 he said
 \u2018I\u2019m telling you \u2013 get up!\u2019 ","Then he answered them: \u2018Go and tell John what you have seen and heard: the blind see
 the lame walk

 the deaf hear
 the dead are raised
 the poor hear the gospel. ","And a blessing on the person who isn\u2019t shocked by me!\u2019","So off went John\u2019s messengers. Jesus then began to talk to the crowds about John. \u2018Why did you go out into the desert?\u2019 he asked. \u2018What were you looking for? A reed swaying in the breeze?","Well then
 what did you go out to see? Someone dressed in silks and satins? See here
 if you want to find people who wear fine clothes and live in luxury
 you\u2019d better look in royal palaces. ","So what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes indeed

 \u201cLook: I send my messenger before my face; he will get my path ready ahead of me.\u201d","\u2018Let me tell you this
\u2019 he went on. \u2018Nobody greater than John has ever been born of women. But the one who is least in God\u2019s kingdom is greater than he is.\u2019","\u2018What picture can I use\u2019
 Jesus continued
 \u2018for the people of this generation? What are they like? ","They\u2019re like children sitting in the square and calling this old riddle to each other: We piped for you and you didn\u2019t dance; we wailed for you and you didn\u2019t cry!","\u2018When John the Baptist came
 he didn\u2019t eat bread or drink wine

 eating and drinking
 you say
 \u201cLook! A glutton and a drunkard

\u2019 replied Jesus
 \u2018I have something to say to you.\u2019 \u2018Go ahead
 Teacher
\u2019 he replied.","\u2018Once upon a time there was a moneylender who had two debtors. The first owed him five hundred dinars; the second a tenth of that.","Neither of them could pay him
 and he let them both off. So which of them will love him more?\u2019","\u2018The one he let off the more
 I suppose
\u2019 replied Simon. \u2018Quite right
\u2019 said Jesus.","Then
 turning towards the woman
 he said to Simon
 \u2018You see this woman? When I came into your house
 you didn\u2019t give me water to wash my feet\u00a0\u2013 but she has washed my feet with her tears
 and wiped them with her hair. ","You didn\u2019t give me a kiss
 but she hasn\u2019t stopped kissing my feet from the moment I came in. ","You didn\u2019t anoint my head with oil
 but she has anointed my feet with ointment.","\u2018So the conclusion I draw is this: she must have been forgiven many sins! Her great love proves it! But if someone has been forgiven only a little
 they will love only a little.\u2019","Then he said to the woman
 \u2018Your sins are forgiven.\u2019","\u2018Your faith has saved you
\u2019 said Jesus to the woman. \u2018Go in peace.\u2019","A large crowd came together
 and people came to him from town after town. He spoke to them in parables: ","\u2018A sower went out to sow his seed. As he was sowing
 some fell by the road
 and was trodden on
 and the birds of the air ate it up. ","Other seed fell on stony ground
 and when it came up it withered
 because it didn\u2019t have any moisture. ","Other seed fell in among thorns
 and when the thorns grew up they choked it. ","Other seed again fell into good soil
 and came up
 and gave a hundredfold yield.\u2019 As he said this
 he called out: \u2018If you\u2019ve got ears to hear
 then hear!\u2019","\u2018You are being let in on the secrets of God\u2019s kingdom
\u2019 he said
 \u2018but to the rest it happens in parables
 so that \u201cthey may see but not perceive
 and hear but not understand.\u201d","\u2018This is the parable: the seed is the word of God.","Those by the roadside are people who hear
 but then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts
 so that they won\u2019t believe it and be saved. ","Those on the stony ground are those who hear the word and receive it with delight\u00a0\u2013 but they don\u2019t have any root
 and so they believe only for a time
 and then
 when a time of testing comes
 they draw back. ","The seed that falls in among thorns represents people who hear
 but as they go on their way they are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life
 and they don\u2019t bear proper
 ripening fruit. ","But those in the good soil are the ones who hear the word and hold on to it with an upright and good heart
 and who patiently produce fruit.\u2019","\u2018Nobody lights a lamp\u2019
 continued Jesus
 \u2018and then hides it under a pot or a bed. They put it on a lampstand
 so that people who come in can see the light. ","You see
 nothing is hidden which won\u2019t become visible; nothing is concealed that won\u2019t come to light.","\u2018So be careful how you listen. If you\u2019ve got something
 more will be given to you; if you haven\u2019t
 even what you imagine you have will be taken away from you.\u2019","So they sent a message to him: \u2018Your mother and your brothers are standing outside
 wanting to see you.\u2019","\u2018Mother and brothers
 indeed?\u2019 replied Jesus. \u2018Here are my mother and brothers\u00a0\u2013 people who hear God\u2019s word and do it!\u2019","One day he got into a boat with his disciples
 and suggested that they cross to the other shore. So they set off. ","\u2018Where\u2019s your faith?\u2019 he asked them. They were afraid and astonished. \u2018Who is this
 then
\u2019 they asked one another
 \u2018if he can give orders to wind and water
 and they obey him?\u2019","\u2018What\u2019s your name?\u2019 Jesus asked him. \u2018Regiment!\u2019 replied the man \u2013 for many demons had entered him.","\u2018Go back to your home
\u2019 he said
 \u2018and tell them what God has done for you.\u2019 And he went off round every town
 declaring what Jesus had done for him.","\u2018Who touched me?\u2019 asked Jesus. Everybody denied it. \u2018Master

 \u2018the crowds are crushing you and pressing you!\u2019","\u2018Somebody touched me
\u2019 said Jesus. \u2018Power went out from me
 and I knew it.\u2019","\u2018Daughter
\u2019 said Jesus
 \u2018your faith has saved you. Go in peace.\u2019","\u2018Don\u2019t be afraid

 and she will be rescued.\u2019","Everyone was weeping and wailing for her. \u2018Don\u2019t cry

 stay there and leave from there. ","If anyone won\u2019t receive you

 \u2018is five loaves and a couple of fishes \u2013 unless you mean we should go ourselves and buy food for all these people?\u2019 ","(There were about five thousand men.) \u2018Get them to sit down\u2019
 Jesus said to them
 \u2018in groups of around fifty each.\u2019","When Jesus was praying alone
 his disciples gathered around him. \u2018Who do the crowds say I am?\u2019 he asked them.","\u2018What about you?\u2019 said Jesus. \u2018Who do you say I am?\u2019 \u2018God\u2019s Messiah

 is there a father among you who will give him a snake? ","Or if he asks for an egg
 will you give him a scorpion? ","Face it: you are evil. And yet you know how to give good presents to your children. How much more will your heavenly father give the holy spirit to those who ask him!\u2019","Jesus was casting out a demon that prevented speech. When the demon had gone out
 the man who had been silent spoke
 and the crowd were amazed. ","Jesus knew what they were thinking. \u2018Every kingdom split down the middle goes to ruin
\u2019 he said. \u2018If a house turns in on itself
 it falls. ","Well then: if even the satan is split down the middle
 how can his kingdom last? This\u2019
 he added
 \u2018is because you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul!","\u2018Now look: supposing I do cast out demons by Beelzebul
 whose power are your own people using when they cast them out? Think about it: they will be your judges. ","But if it\u2019s by God\u2019s finger that I cast out demons
 then God\u2019s kingdom has come upon you.","\u2018Imagine a strong man
 armed to the teeth
 guarding his palace. Everything he owns is safe and sound. ","But supposing someone stronger comes and overpowers him
 and takes away the armour he was trusting in\u00a0\u2013 then he can help himself and start giving the booty away! ","If you\u2019re not with me
 you\u2019re against me. If you\u2019re not gathering with me
 you\u2019re scattering.","\u2018When the unclean spirit goes out of a person
 it roams through desert landscapes looking for a place to rest. When it doesn\u2019t find anywhere
 it says to itself
 \u201cI shall go back to the house I left behind.\u201d ","And it finds the place neat and tidy.","So it sets off and brings along seven other spirits more evil than itself
 and goes back to live there. That person will end up worse off than he began.\u2019","While he was saying these things
 a woman from the crowd raised her voice. \u2018A blessing on the womb that bore you
\u2019 she shouted
 \u2018and the breasts that you sucked!\u2019","\u2018On the contrary
\u2019 replied Jesus. \u2018A blessing on those who hear God\u2019s word and keep it!\u2019","The crowds kept increasing. Jesus began to say to them
 \u2018This generation is an evil generation! It looks for a sign
 and no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah.","\u2018Jonah was a sign to the people of Nineveh; just so
 the son of man will be a sign to this generation. ","The Queen of the South will rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation and will condemn them: she came from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomon\u2019s wisdom
 and look\u00a0\u2013 something greater than Solomon is here. ","The men of Nineveh will rise up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it: they repented at Jonah\u2019s preaching
 and look\u00a0\u2013 something greater than Jonah is here.","\u2018Nobody lights a lamp in order to hide it or put it under a jug. They put it on a lampstand
 so that people who come in can see the light.","\u2018Your eye is the lamp of your body. If your eye is focused
 your whole body is full of light. But if it\u2019s evil
 your body is in darkness. ","Watch out
 then
 in case the light inside you turns to darkness. ","If your whole body is illuminated
 with no part in darkness
 everything will be illuminated
 just as you are by a flash of lightning.\u2019","\u2018Now
 you Pharisees
\u2019 said the master to him
 \u2018you clean the outside of the plate and cup
 but your insides are full of violent robbery and wickedness. ","That\u2019s stupid! Didn\u2019t the one who made the outside make the inside as well?","You should give for alms what\u2019s inside the bowl
 and then everything will be clean for you.\u2019","\u2018But woe betide you Pharisees!\u2019 Jesus continued. \u2018You tithe mint and rue and herbs of all kinds; and you have sidestepped justice

 without missing out the others.","\u2018Woe betide you Pharisees! You love the chief seats in the synagogues and greetings in the market-places.","\u2018Woe betide you! You are like hidden tombs
 and people walk over them without knowing it.\u2019","\u2018Woe betide you lawyers
 too!\u2019 replied Jesus. \u2018You give people heavy loads to carry which they can hardly bear
 and you yourselves don\u2019t lift a finger to help!","\u2018Woe betide you! You build the tombs of the prophets
 and your ancestors killed them. ","So you bear witness that you approve of what your ancestors did: they killed them
 and you build their tombs.","\u2018For all this
 God\u2019s Wisdom says
 \u201cI\u2019m sending you prophets and ambassadors; some of them you will kill and persecute\u201d
 ","so that the blood of all the prophets shed ever since the beginning of the world may be required from this generation\u00a0\u2013","from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zacharias
 who died between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes
 let me tell you
 it will all be required from this generation.","\u2018Woe betide you lawyers! You have taken away the key of knowledge. You didn\u2019t go in yourselves
 and you stopped the people who were trying to go in.\u2019","Crowds were gathering in their thousands
 so much so that they were trampling on each other. Jesus began to say to his disciples
 \u2018Watch out for the leaven of the Pharisees\u00a0\u2013 I mean
 their hypocrisy. This is a matter of first importance.","\u2018Nothing is concealed that won\u2019t be uncovered; nothing is hidden that won\u2019t be made known.","So whatever you say in the darkness will be heard in the light
 and whatever you speak indoors into someone\u2019s ear will be proclaimed from the housetops.","\u2018So
 my friends
 I have this to say to you: don\u2019t be afraid of those who kill the body
 and after that have nothing more they can do. ","I will show you who to fear: fear the one who starts by killing and then has the right to throw people into Gehenna. Yes
 let me tell you
 that\u2019s the one to fear!","\u2018How much do five sparrows cost? Two copper coins? And not one of them is forgotten in God\u2019s presence.","But the hairs of your head have all been counted. Don\u2019t be afraid! You are worth more than lots of sparrows.","\u2018Let me tell you: if anyone acknowledges me before others
 the son of man will acknowledge that person before God\u2019s angels. ","But if anyone denies me before others
 that person will be denied before God\u2019s angels.","\u2018Everyone who speaks a word against the son of man will have it forgiven; but the one who blasphemes against the holy spirit will not be forgiven.","\u2018When they bring you before synagogues
 rulers and authorities
 don\u2019t worry about how to give an answer or what to say. ","The holy spirit will teach you what to say at that very moment.\u2019","\u2018Tell me
 my good man
\u2019 replied Jesus
 \u2018who appointed me as a judge or arbitrator over you?","\u2018Watch out
\u2019 he said to them
 \u2018and beware of all greed! Your life doesn\u2019t consist of the sum total of your possessions.\u2019","He told them a parable. \u2018There was a rich man whose land produced a fine harvest.","\u201cWhat shall I do?\u201d he said to himself. \u201cI don\u2019t have enough room to store my crops!","\u2018\u202f\u201cI know!\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll pull down my barns\u00a0\u2013 and I\u2019ll build bigger ones!

 \u201cFool! This very night your soul will be demanded of you! Now who\u2019s going to have all the things you\u2019ve got ready?\u201d ","That\u2019s how it is with someone who stores up things for himself and isn\u2019t rich before God.","\u2018So let me tell you this
\u2019 he said to the disciples. \u2018Don\u2019t be anxious about your life\u00a0\u2013 what you should eat; or about your body\u00a0\u2013 what you should wear. ","Life is more than food! The body is more than clothing!","Think about the ravens: they don\u2019t sow seed
 they don\u2019t gather harvests
 they don\u2019t have storehouses or barns; and God feeds them. How much more will he feed you! Think of the difference between yourselves and the birds!","\u2018Which of you by being anxious can add a day to your lifetime?","So if you can\u2019t even do a little thing like that
 why worry about anything else? ","Think about the lilies and the way they grow. They don\u2019t work hard
 they don\u2019t weave cloth; but
 let me tell you

 and your father knows you need it. ","This is what you should search for: God\u2019s kingdom! Then all the rest will be given you as well.","Don\u2019t be afraid

 there your heart will be too.\u2019","\u2018Make sure you\u2019re dressed and ready with your lamps alight
\u2019 said Jesus. ","\u2018You need to be like people waiting for their master when he comes back from the wedding-feast
 so that when he comes and knocks they will be able to open the door for him at once. ","A blessing on the servants whom the master finds awake when he comes! I\u2019m telling you the truth: he will put on an apron and sit them down and come and wait on them.","A blessing on them if he comes in the second watch of the night
 or even the third
 and finds them like that!","\u2018But you should know this: if the householder had known what time the thief was coming
 he wouldn\u2019t have let his house be broken into. ","You too should be ready
 because the son of man is coming at a time you don\u2019t expect.\u2019","\u2018Who then is the faithful and wise servant
\u2019 said Jesus
 \u2018whom the master will set over all his household
 to give them their allowance of food at the proper time? ","A blessing on the servant that his master
 when he comes
 finds doing just that! ","I\u2019m telling you truly
 he will install him as manager over all his possessions. ","But if that servant says in his heart
 \u201cMy master is taking his time over coming back
\u201d and begins to beat the slaves and slave-girls
 to eat and drink and get drunk\u00a0\u2013 ","then the master of that servant will come on a day he doesn\u2019t expect him to
 and at a moment he didn\u2019t imagine
 and he will cut him in two. He will give him the same place as the unbelievers.","\u2018If a servant knew what the master wanted
 and didn\u2019t get ready
 or do what was wanted
 the punishment will be a severe beating. ","If the servant didn\u2019t know
 and did what deserved a beating
 it will be a light beating. Much will be required from one who is given much; if someone is entrusted with much
 even more will be expected in return.\u2019","\u2018I came to throw fire upon the earth
\u2019 Jesus continued
 \u2018and I wish it were already alight! ","I have a baptism to be baptized with
 and I am under huge pressure until it\u2019s happened!","\u2018Do you suppose I\u2019ve come to give peace to the earth? No

 and didn\u2019t find any. ","So he said to the gardener

 if it fruits next year
 well and good; and if not
 you can cut it down.\u201d\u202f\u2019","Jesus saw her and called to her.","\u2018You bunch of hypocrites!\u2019 replied Jesus. \u2018You would all be quite happy to untie an ox or a donkey from its stall on the sabbath day and lead it out for a drink!","And isn\u2019t it right that this daughter of Abraham
 tied up by the satan for these eighteen years

 \u2018What is God\u2019s kingdom like? What shall we compare it with? ","It\u2019s like a mustard seed that someone took and placed in his garden. It grew
 and became a tree
 and the birds of the sky made nests in its branches.\u2019","And again he said
 \u2018What shall we say God\u2019s kingdom is like? ","It\u2019s like leaven that a woman took and hid in three measures of flour

 \u201cI\u2019ve been slaving for you all these years! I\u2019ve never disobeyed a single commandment of yours. And you never even gave me a young goat so I could have a party with my friends. ","But when this son of yours comes home

 the steward said to himself
 \u201cWhat shall I do? My master is taking away my stewardship from me! I can\u2019t do manual work

 \u201csit down quickly

 \u201cAnd how much do you owe?\u201d \u2018\u202f\u201cA hundred measures of wheat

 are wiser than the children of light when it comes to dealing with their own generation.","\u2018So let me tell you this: use that dishonest stuff called money to make yourselves friends! Then
 when it gives out
 they will welcome you into homes that will last.\u2019","\u2018Someone who is faithful in a small matter\u2019

 \u2018will also be faithful in a large one. Someone who is dishonest in a small matter will also be dishonest in a large one. ","If you haven\u2019t been faithful with that wicked thing called money
 who is going to entrust you with true wealth? ","And if you haven\u2019t been faithful in looking after what belongs to someone else

 God calls abominable!","\u2018The law and the prophets lasted until John. From now on

 and from imagining all that\u2019s going to happen to the world. The powers of the heavens will be shaken. ","Then they will see \u201cthe son of man coming on a cloud\u201d with power and great majesty.","When all these things start to happen
 stand up and lift up your heads
 because the time has come for you to be redeemed.\u2019","He told them this parable. \u2018Look at the fig tree and all the trees.","When they are well into leaf
 you can see for yourselves and know that summer is upon you. ","In the same way
 when you see all these things happening
 you will know that God\u2019s kingdom is upon you. ","I\u2019m telling you the truth; this generation won\u2019t be gone before all of this happens.","Heaven and earth may disappear
 but these words of mine won\u2019t disappear.\u2019","\u2018So watch out for yourselves
\u2019 said Jesus
 \u2018that your hearts may not grow heavy with dissipation and drunkenness and the cares of this life
 so that that day comes upon you suddenly
 ","like a trap. It will come
 you see
 on everyone who lives on the face of the earth. ","Keep awake at all times
 praying that you may have strength to escape all these things that will happen
 and to stand before the son of man.\u2019","Jesus dispatched Peter and John. \u2018Off you go
\u2019 he said
 \u2018and get the Passover ready for us to eat.\u2019","\u2018Listen carefully
\u2019 said Jesus. \u2018As you go into the city a man will meet you carrying a jar of water. Follow him
 and when he goes into a house
 go after him. ","Then say to the householder there
 \u201cThe teacher says
 \u2018Where is the living-room where I can eat the Passover with my disciples?\u2019\u202f\u201d ","And he will show you a large upstairs room
 laid out and ready. Make the preparations there.\u2019","\u2018I have been so much looking forward to eating this Passover with you before I have to suffer
\u2019 he said to them. ","\u2018For\u00a0\u2013 let me tell you\u00a0\u2013 I won\u2019t eat it again until it\u2019s fulfilled in the kingdom of God.\u2019","Then he took a cup
 and gave thanks
 and said
 \u2018Take this and share it among yourselves. ","Let me tell you
 from now on I won\u2019t drink from the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.\u2019","Then he took some bread. He gave thanks
 broke it and gave it to them. \u2018This is my body

 \u2018which is given for you. Do this in memory of me.\u2019","So too
 after supper
 with the cup: \u2018This cup\u2019

 in my blood which is shed for you.","\u2018But look here! The hand of the one who will betray me is with me at this table.","The son of man is indeed going
 as it is marked out for him; but woe betide that man by whom he is betrayed!\u2019","\u2018Pagan kings lord it over their subjects
\u2019 said Jesus to them
 \u2018and people in power get themselves called \u201cBenefactors\u201d. ","That\u2019s not how it\u2019s to be with you. The most important among you ought to be like the youngest. The leader should be like the servant.","After all
 who is the more important
 the one who sits at table or the one who waits on him? The one at table
 obviously! But I am with you here like a servant.","\u2018You are the ones who have stuck it out with me through the trials I\u2019ve had to endure.","This is my bequest to you: the kingdom my father bequeathed to me!","What does this mean? You will eat and drink at my table
 in my kingdom
 and you will sit on thrones
 judging the twelve tribes of Israel.","\u2018Simon
 Simon
 listen to this. The satan demanded to have you. He wanted to shake you into bits like wheat. ","But I prayed for you; I prayed that you wouldn\u2019t run out of faith. And
 when you turn back again
 you must give strength to your brothers.\u2019","\u2018Master

\u2019 Jesus said to them
 \u2018without purse or bag or sandals

\u2019 they replied.","\u2018But now
\u2019 he said
 \u2018anyone who has a purse should take it
 and the same with a bag. And anyone who doesn\u2019t have a sword should sell his cloak and buy one. ","Let me tell you this: when the Bible says
 \u201cHe was reckoned with the lawless\u201d
 it must find its fulfilment in me. Yes; everything about me must reach its goal.\u2019","\u2018Look
 Master
\u2019 they said
 \u2018we\u2019ve got a couple of swords here.\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s enough!\u2019 he said to them.","When he came to the place
 he said to them
 \u2018Pray that you won\u2019t come into the trial.\u2019","\u2018Father
\u2019 he said
 \u2018if you wish it\u00a0\u2013 please take this cup away from me! But it must be your will
 not mine.\u2019 ","\u2018Why are you sleeping?\u2019 he said to them. \u2018Get up and pray
 so that you won\u2019t come into the trial.\u2019","but Jesus said to him
 \u2018Judas! Are you going to betray the son of man with a kiss?\u2019","\u2018Enough of that!\u2019 said Jesus
 and healed the ear with a touch.","Then Jesus spoke to the chief priests
 the Temple guardsmen
 and the elders who had come after him. \u2018Anyone would think I was a brigand

 \u2018for you to come out with swords and clubs! ","Every day I\u2019ve been in the Temple with you and you never laid hands on me. But your moment has come at last
 and so has the power of darkness.\u2019","The master turned and looked at Peter
 and Peter called to mind the words the master had spoken to him: \u2018Before the cock crows
 this very day
 you will deny me three times.\u2019 ","\u2018If you are the Messiah
\u2019 they said
 \u2018tell us!\u2019 \u2018If I tell you
\u2019 he said to them
 \u2018you won\u2019t believe me.","And if I ask you a question
 you won\u2019t answer me. ","But from now on the son of man will be seated at the right hand of God\u2019s power.\u2019","\u2018So you\u2019re the son of God
 are you?\u2019 they said. \u2018You say that I am
\u2019 he said to them.","So Pilate asked Jesus
 \u2018You are the king of the Jews?\u2019 \u2018You said it
\u2019 replied Jesus.","When Pilate heard that
 he asked if the man was indeed a Galilean. ","\u2018You brought this man before me
\u2019 he said to them
 \u2018on the grounds that he was leading the people astray. Look here
 then: I examined him in your presence and I found no evidence in him of the charges you\u2019re bringing against him. ","\u2018Why?\u2019 he said for the third time. \u2018What\u2019s he done wrong? I can\u2019t find anything he\u2019s done that deserves death
 so I\u2019m going to beat him and let him go.\u2019","Jesus turned and spoke to them. \u2018Daughters of Jerusalem
\u2019 he said
 \u2018don\u2019t cry for me. Cry for yourselves instead! Cry for your children! ","Listen: the time is coming when you will say
 \u201cA blessing on the barren! A blessing on wombs that never bore children
 and breasts that never nursed them!\u201d ","At that time people will start to say to the mountains
 \u201cFall on us\u201d

 \u201cCover us\u201d! ","Yes: if this is what they do with the green tree
 what will happen to the dry one?\u2019","\u2018Father

 \u2018you\u2019ll be with me in paradise
 this very day.\u2019","Then Jesus shouted out at the top of his voice
 \u2018Here\u2019s my spirit

 and bowed their faces towards the ground. But the men said to them
 \u2018Why look for the living with the dead? ","\u2018You\u2019re obviously having a very important discussion on your walk
\u2019 he said; \u2018what\u2019s it all about?\u2019 They stood still
 a picture of gloom. ","\u2018What things?\u2019 he asked. \u2018To do with Jesus of Nazareth
\u2019 they said to him. \u2018He was a prophet. He acted with power and he spoke with power
 before God and all the people.","\u2018You are so senseless!\u2019 he said to them. \u2018So slow in your hearts to believe all the things the prophets said to you! Don\u2019t you see?","This is what had to happen: the Messiah had to suffer
 and then come into his glory!\u2019","As they were saying this
 Jesus himself stood in the midst of them
 and said
 \u2018Peace be with you.\u2019 ","\u2018Why are you so disturbed?\u2019 he said. \u2018Why do these questionings come up in your hearts?","Look at my hands and feet; it really is me
 myself. Touch me and see! Ghosts don\u2019t have flesh and bones like you can see I have.\u2019","While they were still in disbelief and amazement from sheer joy
 he said to them
 \u2018Have you got something here to eat?\u2019 ","Then he said to them
 \u2018This is what I was talking to you about when I was still with you. Everything written about me in the law of Moses
 and in the prophets and the Psalms
 had to be fulfilled.\u2019 ","\u2018This is what is written
\u2019 he said. \u2018The Messiah must suffer and rise from the dead on the third day
 ","and in his name repentance
 for the forgiveness of sins
 must be announced to all the nations
 beginning from Jerusalem. ","You are the witnesses for all this.","Now
 look: I\u2019m sending upon you what my father has promised. But stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high.\u2019","Then He said to them
 \u201cHow is it that you sought Me? Did you not know that I must go about My Father\u2019s business?\u201d","But Jesus answered him
 saying
 \u201cIt is written
 \u2018Man shall not live by bread only
 but by every word of God.\u2019\u201d","And the devil said to Him
 \u201cAll this power
 and the glory of those kingdoms
 will I give You. For that is delivered to me. And to whomever I will
 I give it.","But Jesus answered him
 and said
 \u201cGet behind me
 Satan! For it is written
 \u2018You shall worship the Lord your God
 and Him alone You shall serve.\u2019\u201d","Then he brought Him to Jerusalem
 and set Him on a pinnacle of the Temple
 and said to Him
 \u201cIf You are the Son of God
 cast Yourself down from here.","And Jesus answered
 and said to him
 \u201cIt is said
 \u2018You shall not tempt the Lord your God.\u2019\u201d","\u201cThe Spirit of the Lord is upon Me
 because He has anointed Me
 that I should preach the Gospel to the poor. He has sent Me
 that I should heal the brokenhearted
 that I should preach deliverance to the captives
 and recovering of sight to the blind; that I should set at liberty them that are bruised
","and that I should preach the acceptable year of the Lord.\u201d","Then He began to say to them
 \u201cThis day is the Scripture fulfilled in your ears.\u201d","Then He said to them
 \u201cYou will surely say to me this proverb
 \u2018Physician
 heal Yourself. Whatever we have heard was done in Capernaum
 do it here also in Your own country.\u2019\u201d","And He said
 \u201cTruly I say to you
 no Prophet is accepted in his own country.","\u201cBut I tell you the truth
 many widows were in Israel in the days of Elijah
 when Heaven was shut three years and six months
 when great famine was throughout all the land.","\u201cBut to none of them was Elijah sent
 except to a certain widow in Zarephath
 of Sidon.","\u201cAlso
 many lepers were in Israel in the time of Elisha the Prophet. Yet none of them was made clean
 except Naaman the Syrian.\u201d","And they were astonished at His doctrine. For His word was with authority.","And Jesus rebuked him
 saying
 \u201cBe quiet! And come out of him!\u201d Then the demon
 throwing him in the midst of them
 came out of him and did not hurt him.","And demons also came out of many
 crying
 and saying
 \u201cYou are the Christ
 the Son of God!\u201d But He rebuked them and did not allow them to say that they knew Him to be the Christ.","But He said to them
 \u201cSurely I must also preach the Kingdom of God to other cities. For that is why I was sent.\u201d","Now when He had stopped speaking
 He said to Simon
 \u201cLaunch out into the deep. And let down your nets to make a catch.\u201d","And so also were James and John
 the sons of Zebedee
 who were companions of Simon. Then Jesus said to Simon
 \u201cDo not fear. From now on you shall catch men.\u201d","So he stretched forth his hand
 and touched him
 saying
 \u201cI will. Be clean.\u201d And immediately the leprosy departed from him.","And He commanded him that he should tell no one. \u201cBut go and show yourself to the priest. And offer as Moses has commanded for your cleansing
 for a witness to them.\u201d","And when He saw their faith
 He said to him
 \u201cMan
 your sins are forgiven you.\u201d","But when Jesus perceived their reasoning
 He answered
 and said to them
 \u201cWhy do you reason in your hearts?","\u201cWhich is easier to say
 \u2018Your sins are forgiven you\u2019
 or to say
 \u2018Rise and walk?\u2019\u201d","But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority to forgive sins on earth
 I say to you (said He to the paralytic)
 Arise. Take up your bed. And go to your house.\u201d","And after that
 He went forth and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax booth
 and said to him
 \u201cFollow Me.\u201d","Then Jesus answered
 and said to them
 \u201cThose who are whole
 do not need the Physician
 but those who are sick.","I did not come to call the righteous to repentance
 but sinners.\u201d","Then they said to Him
 \u201cWhy do the disciples of John often fast and pray
 and of the Pharisees also
 but Yours eat and drink?\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cCan you make the children of the wedding chamber fast
 as long as the bridegroom is with them?","\u201cBut the days will come when even the bridegroom shall be taken away from them. Then shall they fast in those days.\u201d","Then He also told them a parable. \u201cNo one sews a piece of a new garment into an old one. For then the new tears it
 and the piece taken out of the new does not match the old.","\u201cAlso
 no one pours new wine into old vessels. For then the new wine will break the vessels
 and it will run out. And the vessels will perish.","\u201cBut new wine must be poured into new vessels. So that both are preserved.","\u201cAlso
 no one who drinks old wine immediately desires new. For he says
 \u2018The old is better.\u2019\u201d","Then Jesus answered them
 and said
 \u201cHave you not read what David did when he himself
 and those who were with him
 were hungry?","\u201cHow he went into the house of God and took and ate the showbread
 and also gave to those who were with him (which was not lawful to eat
 except only for the priests)?\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cThe Son of Man is also Lord of the Sabbath day.\u201d","But He knew their thoughts and said to the man who had the withered hand
 \u201cArise
 and stand up in the midst.\u201d And he arose and stood up.","Then Jesus said to them
 \u201cI will ask you a question: Which is lawful on the Sabbath days - to do good
 or to do evil; to save life
 or to destroy?\u201d","And He looked around at them all and said to the man
 \u201cStretch forth your hand.\u201d And he did so. And his hand was restored again
 as whole as the other.","\u201cBlessed are you who hunger now. For you shall be satisfied. Blessed are you who weep now. For you shall laugh.","\u201cBlessed are you when men hate you
 and when they separate you
 and revile you
 and put out your name as evil
 for the Son of Man\u2019s sake.","\u201cRejoice on that day and be glad. For behold
 your reward is great in Heaven. For in like manner did their fathers to the Prophets:","\u201cBut woe to you rich. For you have received your comfort.","\u201cWoe to you who are full. For you shall hunger. Woe to you who now laugh. For you shall wail and weep.","\u201cWoe to you when all men speak well of you. For so did their fathers to the false prophets.","\u201cBut I say to you who hear: Love your enemies. Do well to those who hate you.","\u201cBless those who curse you and pray for those who hurt you.","\u201cAnd to the one who strikes you on the cheek
 offer also the other
 and the one who takes away your cloak
 do not forbid to take your coat also.","\u201cGive to everyone who asks of you. And from the one who takes away what is yours
 do not ask for it back.","\u201cAnd as you would have men do to you
 so likewise do to them.","\u201cFor if you love those who love you
 what thanks shall you have? For even the sinners love those who love them.","And if you love those who love you
 what thanks shall you have? For even the sinners do the same.","\u201cAnd if you lend to those from whom you hope to receive
 what thanks shall you have? For even the sinners lend to sinners to receive the same.","\u201cTherefore
 love your enemies. And do good. And lend
 looking for nothing in return. And your reward shall be great. And you shall be the children of the Most High. For He is kind to the ungrateful and to the evil.","\u201cTherefore
 be merciful
 as your Father is also merciful.","\u201cDo not judge. And you shall not be judged. Do not condemn. And you shall not be condemned. Forgive
 and you shall be forgiven.","\u201cGive
 and it shall be given to you. A good measure
 pressed down
 shaken together
 and running over
 shall be laid in your lap. For with what measure you measure
 it shall be measured to you again.\u201d","And He spoke a parable to them
 \u201cCan the blind lead the blind? Shall they not both fall into the ditch?","\u201cThe disciple is not above the master. But whoever would be a perfect disciple shall be as his master.","\u201cAnd why do you see a splinter in your brother\u2019s eye
 yet do not consider the beam that is in your own eye?","\u201cOr
 how can you say to your brother
 \u2018Brother
 let me pull out the splinter that is in your eye
\u2019 when you do not see the beam that is in your own eye? Hypocrite! Cast out the beam from your own eye first. And then you shall see perfectly to pull out the splinter that is in your brother\u2019s eye.","\u201cFor it is not a good tree that brings forth evil fruit
 nor an evil tree that brings forth good fruit.","\u201cFor every tree is known by its own fruit. For figs are not gathered from thorns
 nor are grapes gathered from bushes.","\u201cA good man
 out of the good treasure of his heart
 brings forth good. And an evil man
 out of the evil treasure of his heart
 brings forth evil. For out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.","\u201cBut why do you call Me \u2018Lord
 Lord\u2019 and do not do the things that I speak?","\u201cWhoever comes to Me and hears My words
 and does the same
 I will show you to whom he is like.","\u201cHe is like a man who built a house
 and dug deep
 and laid the foundation on a rock. And when the waters rose
 the flood beat upon that house
 but could not shake it. For it was grounded upon a rock.","\u201cBut the one who hears and does not do
 is like a man who built a house upon the earth without foundation (against which the flood beat
 and it immediately fell). And the fall of that house was great.\u201d","When Jesus heard these things
 He marveled at him. And He turned and said to the people who followed him
 \u201cI say to you
 I have not found so great faith! No. Not in Israel.\u201d","And when the Lord saw her
 He had compassion on her
 and said to her
 \u201cDo not weep.\u201d","And He went and touched the coffin. And those who bore him stood still. And He said
 \u201cYoung man

 \u2018Arise.\u2019\u201d","And Jesus answered

 He began to speak to the people of John

 those who are gorgeously appareled
 and live delicately
 are in kings\u2019 courts.","\u201cBut what did you go forth to see - a Prophet? \u2018Yes\u2019

 \u2018and greater than a Prophet.\u2019","\u201cThis is He of Whom it is written: \u2018Behold
 I send My messenger before your face

 whoever is the least in the Kingdom of God
 is greater than him.\u201d","And the Lord said
 \u201cTo what shall I liken the men of this generation? And what are they like?","\u201cThey are like little children sitting in the marketplace
 crying one to another
 saying
 \u2018We have played the flute for you

 and you have not wept.\u2019","\u201cFor John Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine. And you say
 \u2018He has a demon.\u2019","\u201cThe Son of Man has come
 and eats
 and drinks. And you say

 saw it
 he spoke to himself

 and said to him
 \u201cSimon

 \u201cMaster
 say on.\u201d","\u201cThere was a certain lender who had two debtors. One owed five hundred denarii
 and the other fifty.","\u201cWhen they had nothing with which to pay
 he forgave them both. Therefore
 tell Me
 which of them will love him most?\u201d","Simon answered
 and said
 \u201cI suppose the one to whom he forgave most.\u201d And He said to him
 \u201cYou have judged rightly.\u201d","Then he turned to the woman
 and said to Simon
 \u201cSee this woman? I entered into your house and you gave Me no water for my feet. But she has washed my feet with tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head.","\u201cYou gave Me no kiss. But since the time I came in
 she has not ceased to kiss My feet.","\u201cYou did not anoint My head with oil. But she has anointed My feet with ointment.","\u201cTherefore I say to you her many sins are forgiven. For she has loved much. But the one to whom little is forgiven
 loves little.\u201d","And he said to her
 \u201cYour sins are forgiven.\u201d","And He said to the woman
 \u201cYour faith has saved you. Go in peace.\u201d","Now when many people had gathered together and come to Him out of all the cities
 He spoke a parable.","\u201cA sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed
 some fell by the wayside. And it was trampled underfoot
 and the birds of heaven devoured it.","\u201cAnd some fell on the stones. And after it sprung up
 it withered away
 because it lacked moisture.","\u201cAnd some fell among thorns. And the thorns sprang up with it and choked it.","\u201cAnd some fell on good ground. And it sprang up and bore fruit
 a hundredfold.\u201d And as He said these things
 He cried
 \u201cThe one who has ears to hear
 let him hear!\u201d","And He said
 \u201cTo you it is given to know the secrets of the Kingdom of God. But to others they come in parables. So that when they see
 they will not see. And when they hear
 they will not understand.","\u201cThe parable is this: The seed is the word of God.","\u201cAnd that which are along the way are those who hear
 but afterward the devil comes and takes away the word out of their hearts
 lest they should believe and be saved.","\u201cBut the ones on the stones are those who
 when they have heard the word
 receive it with joy. But they have no roots. So
 for a while they believe
 but in the time of temptation they go away.","\u201cAnd that which fell among thorns are those who have heard
 but after their departure are choked with cares and riches and the pursuit of pleasure. And they bring forth no fruit.","\u201cBut that which fell in good ground are those who hear the word with an honest and good heart
 and keep it
 and bring forth fruit through patience.","\u201cNo one
 when he lights a candle
 hides it under a vessel
 or puts it under the bed. But he sets it on a candlestick
 so that those who enter may see the light.","\u201cFor nothing is secret that shall not be evident. Nor is anything hidden that shall not be known
 and come to light.","\u201cTherefore
 watch how you hear. For whoever has
 to him shall be given. And whoever has not
 even that which he seems to have shall be taken from him.","And someone said to Him
 \u201cYour mother and Your brothers are standing outside
 and wish see You.","But He answered
 and said to them
 \u201cMy mother and My brothers are those who hear the word of God and do it.\u201d","And it happened that on a certain day
 He went into a ship with His disciples. And He said to them
 \u201cLet us go over to the other side of the lake.\u201d And they launched forth.","Then He said to them
 \u201cWhere is your faith?\u201d And they feared
 and wondered among themselves
 saying
 \u201cWho is this Who commands both the winds and water? And they obey Him!\u201d","Then Jesus asked him
 saying
 \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d And he said
 \u201cLegion!\u201d (because many demons had entered into him).","\u201cReturn to your own house. And show what great things God has done to you.\u201d So
 he went his way
 and preached throughout all the city what great things Jesus had done to him.","Then Jesus said
 \u201cWho touched Me?\u201d When everyone denied it
 Peter and those with him said
 \u201cMaster
 the multitude jostles You
 and presses against You
 and You say
 \u2018Who touched Me?\u2019\u201d","And Jesus said
 \u201cSomeone touched Me. For I perceive that power has gone out of Me.\u201d","And He said to her
 \u201cDaughter
 be of good courage. Your faith has saved you. Go in peace.\u201d","When Jesus heard it
 He answered him
 saying
 \u201cDo not fear. Only believe
 and she shall be saved.\u201d","And all wept and mourned for her. But He said
 \u201cDo not weep. For she is not dead
 but sleeps.\u201d","So He sent them all out. And He took her by the hand and cried
 saying
 \u201cLittle girl
 arise!\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cTake nothing on your journey
 neither staff
 nor bag
 nor bread
 nor money; nor have two tunics apiece.","\u201cAnd whatever house you enter
 stay there
 and leave from there.","\u201cAnd however many will not receive you
 when you go out of that city
 shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them.\u201d","But He said to them
 \u201cYou give them something to eat.\u201d And they said
 \u201cWe have no more than five loaves and two fish
 unless we go and buy food for all these people.\u201d","For there were about five thousand men. Then He said to His disciples
 \u201cMake them sit down in groups of fifty.\u201d","And it happened that as He was alone praying
 His disciples were with Him. And He asked them
 saying
 \u201cWhom do the people say that I am?\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cBut Whom do you say that I am?\u201d Peter answered
 and said
 \u201cThe Christ of God.\u201d","saying
 \u201cThe Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders
 and by the chief priests and scribes
 and be killed; and the third day rise again.\u201d","And He said to them all
 \u201cIf anyone would come after Me
 let him deny himself
 and take up his cross daily
 and follow Me.","\u201cFor whoever would save his life
 shall lose it. And whoever shall lose his life
 for my sake
 the same shall save it.","\"For what does it benefit a man if he wins the whole world and destroys himself
 or loses himself?","\u201cFor whoever shall be ashamed of Me and My words
 of him shall the Son of Man be ashamed when He shall come in His own glory
 and in the glory of the Father
 and of the holy angels.","\u201cAnd I tell you truly
 there are some standing here who shall not taste of death till they have seen the Kingdom of God.\u201d","And it happened that as they departed from Him
 Peter said to Jesus
 \u201cMaster
 it is good for us to be here. Therefore
 let us make three tabernacles: one for You
 and one for Moses
 and one for Elijah
\u201d not knowing what he said.","Then Jesus answered and said
 \u201cO faithless and perverse generation! How long now shall I be with you
 and bear with you? Bring your son here.\u201d","\u201cLet these words sink down into your ears. For the time will come when the Son of Man shall be delivered into the hands of men.\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cWhoever receives this little child in My Name
 receives Me. And whoever shall receive Me
 receives Him Who sent Me. For the one who is least among you all shall be great.\u201d","Then Jesus said to him
 \u201cDo not forbid him. For whoever is not against us
 is with us.\u201d","And Jesus said to him
 \u201cThe foxes have holes and the birds of the heaven nests. But the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head.\u201d","But He said to another
 \u201cFollow Me.\u201d But he said
 \u201cLord
 first let me go and bury my father.\u201d","And Jesus said to him
 \u201cLet the dead bury their dead. But go and preach the Kingdom of God.\u201d","And Jesus said to him
 \u201cNo one who puts his hand to the plough and looks back is fit for the Kingdom of God.\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cThe harvest is great
 but the laborers are few. Therefore
 pray the Lord of the Harvest to send out laborers into His harvest.","\u201cGo your ways. Behold
 I send you out as lambs among wolves.","\u201cCarry no money bag
 nor sack
 nor shoes
 and greet no one on the way.","\u201cAnd into whatever house you enter
 say first
 \u2018Peace to this house.\u2019","\u201cAnd if a son of peace is there
 your peace shall rest upon him. If not
 it shall return to you again.","\u201cAnd remain in that same house
 eating and drinking what they give. For the laborer is worthy of his wages. Do not go from house to house.","\u201cBut into whatever city you shall enter
 if they receive you
 eat what is set before you
","\u201cand heal the sick who are there
 and say to them
 \u2018The Kingdom of God has come near to you.\u2019","\u201cBut in whatever city you enter
 if they will not receive you
 go out into the streets of that city
 and say
","\u201c\u2018Even the very dust of your city
 which clings to us
 we wipe off against you. Nevertheless
 know this: that the Kingdom of God has come near to you.\u2019","\u201cFor I say to you that it shall be easier on that Day for those of Sodom
 than for that city.","\u201cWoe to you
 Chorazin! Woe to you
 Bethsaida! For if the miracles which have been done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon
 they would have repented long ago
 sitting in sackcloth and ashes.","\u201cTherefore it shall be easier for Tyre and Sidon at the Judgment than for you.","\u201cAnd you
 Capernaum
 who is exalted to Heaven
 shall be thrust down to Hades.","\u201cThe one who hears you
 hears Me. And the one who despises you
 despises Me. And the one who despises Me
 despises Him Who sent Me.\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cI saw Satan fall down
 like lightning
 from Heaven.","\u201cBehold
 I give you power to tread on serpents and scorpions
 and over all the power of the enemy. And nothing shall hurt you.","Nevertheless
 do not rejoice in this: that the spirits obey you. But rather
 rejoice because your names are written in Heaven.\u201d","That same hour
 Jesus rejoiced in the Spirit
 and said
 \u201cI confess to You
 Father
 Lord of Heaven and Earth
 that You have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and have revealed them to infants. Yes
 Father
 because it so pleased You.","\u201cAll things are given to Me by My Father. And no one knows Who the Son is
 except the Father; nor Who the Father is
 except the Son and him to whom the Son wishes to reveal Him.\u201d","And He turned to His disciples
 and said secretly
 \u201cBlessed are the eyes that see what you see.","\u201cFor I tell you that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which you see and have not seen them; and to hear those things which you hear
 and have not heard them.","Then behold
 a certain lawyer stood up and tempted Him
 saying
 \u201cMaster
 what shall I do to inherit eternal life?\u201d","And He said to him
 \u201cWhat is written in the Law? How do you read it?\u201d","Then He said to him
 \u201cYou have answered right. Do this
 and you shall live.\u201d","And Jesus answered
 and said
 \u201cA certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among thieves. And they robbed him of his clothes and wounded him and departed
 leaving him half-dead.","\u201cNow by chance
 a certain priest came down that same way. And when he saw him
 he passed by on the other side.","\u201cAnd likewise
 a Levite
 when he had come near the place
 went and looked
 and passed by on the other side.","\u201cThen a certain Samaritan
 as he journeyed
 came near him. And when he saw him
 he had compassion on him.","\u201cAnd he went to him and bound up his wounds and poured in oil and wine. And he put him on his own beast and brought him to an Inn and made provision for him.","\u201cAnd the next day
 when he departed
 he took out two denarii
 and gave them to the host
 and said to him
 \u2018Take care of him. And whatever more you spend I will repay when I return.\u2019","\u201cNow
 which of these three do you think was a neighbor to him who fell among the thieves?\u201d","And he said
 \u201cThe one who showed mercy on him.\u201d Then Jesus said to him
 \u201cGo
 and do likewise.\u201d","And Jesus answered
 and said to her
 \u201cMartha
 Martha. You are anxious and troubled about many things.","\u201cBut one thing is needed
 Mary has chosen the good part
 which shall not be taken away from her.\u201d","And so it was that as He was praying in a certain place
 when He ceased
 one of His disciples said to Him
 \u201cLord
 teach us to pray as John also taught his disciples.\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cWhen you pray
 say
 \u2018Our Father
 Who are in Heaven
 hallowed be Your Name. Your Kingdom come. Let Your will be done even on Earth
 as in Heaven.","\u2018Give us our daily bread each day.","\u2018And forgive us our sins. As we also forgive everyone who is indebted to us. And do not lead us into trial. But deliver us from the evil one.\u2019\u201d","Moreover He said to them
 \u201cWhich of you shall have a friend
 and shall go to him at midnight
 and say to him
 \u2018Friend
 lend me three loaves.","\u2018For a friend of mine has come out of the way to me
 and I have nothing to set before him.\u2019","\u201cAnd the one inside answers
 and says
 \u2018Do not trouble me. The door is now shut
 and my children are with me in bed. I cannot rise and give them to you?\u2019","\u201cI say to you that though he would not rise and give to him because he is his friend
 yet he would undoubtedly rise and give him as many as he needed because of his persistence.","\u201cAnd I say to you
 ask
 and it shall be given to you. Seek
 and you shall find. Knock
 and it shall be opened to you.","\u201cFor everyone who asks
 receives. And the one who seeks
 finds. And to the one who knocks
 it shall be opened.","\u201cIf a son shall ask for bread from any of you who is a father
 will he give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish
 will he give him a serpent instead?","\u201cOr if he asks for an egg
 will he give him a scorpion?","\u201cIf you
 then
 who are evil
 can give good gifts to your children
 how much more shall your Heavenly Father give the Holy Ghost to those who desire Him?","Then He cast out a demon who was dumb. And when the demon had gone out
 the dumb spoke
 and the people wondered.","But He knew their thoughts
 and said to them
 \u201cEvery kingdom divided against itself
 shall be desolate. And a house divided against a house
 falls.","So
 if Satan is also divided against himself
 how shall his kingdom stand? For you say that I cast out demons through Beelzebub?","If I cast out demons through Beelzebub
 by whom do your children cast them out? Therefore
 they shall be your judges.","But if I cast out demons by the finger of God
 doubtless the Kingdom of God has come to you.","When a strong man
 fully armed
 guards his house
 the things that he possesses are in peace.","But when someone stronger comes upon him and overcomes him
 he takes away all the armor in which he had trusted and divides his spoils.","\u201cWhoever is not with Me
 is against Me. And whoever does not gather with Me
 scatters.","\u201cWhen the unclean spirit has gone out of a man
 he walks through dry places
 seeking rest. And when he finds none
 he says
 \u2018I will return to the house from where I came out.\u2019","\u201cAnd when he comes
 he finds it swept and put in order.","\u201cThen he goes and takes with him seven other spirits worse than himself. And they enter in
 and dwell there. So
 the last state of that man is worse than the first.\u201d","And it happened that as He said these things
 a certain woman in the crowd lifted up her voice
 and said to him
 \u201cBlessed is the womb that bore You
 and the breasts which You have sucked.\u201d","But He said
 \u201cOn the contrary. Blessed are those who hear the word of God and keep it.\u201d","And when the people were thickly gathered together
 He began to say
 \u201cThis is a wicked generation! They seek a sign. And no sign shall be given to them
 except the sign of Jonah the Prophet.","\u201cFor as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites
 so also shall the Son of Man be to this generation.","\u201cThe Queen of the South shall rise in judgment with the men of this generation and shall condemn them. For she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon. And behold
 a Greater than Solomon is here.","\u201cThe men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation and shall condemn it. For they repented at the preaching of Jonah. And behold
 a Greater than Jonah is here.","\u201cNo one
 when he has lit a candle
 puts it in a private place
 or under a bushel
 but on a candlestick. So that those who come in may see the light.","\u201cThe light of the body is the eye. Therefore
 when your eye is sound
 then your whole body is light. But if your eye is evil
 then your body is dark.","\u201cTake care
 therefore
 that the light which is in you is not darkness.","\u201cTherefore
 if your whole body is full of light - having no part darkness - then all shall be light (just as when a candle lights you with its brightness).\u201d","And the Lord said to him
 \u201cIndeed you Pharisees make the outside of the cup and the platter clean
 but the inward part is full of plundering and wickedness.","\u201cYou fools. Did not He Who made that which is outside also make that which is inside?","\u201cTherefore
 give alms from those things which you have. And behold
 all things shall be clean to you.","\u201cBut woe to you
 Pharisees! For you tithe mint and rue and all kinds of herbs but pass over judgment and the love of God. These you ought to have done while not leaving the other undone.","\u201cWoe to you
 Pharisees! For you love the uppermost seats in the synagogues and greetings in the markets.","\u201cWoe to you
 scribes and Pharisees! Hypocrites! For you are as unseen graves
 and the men who walk over them are unaware.\u201d","And He said
 \u201cWoe to you also
 you lawyers! For you load men with heavy burdens to bear. And you yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers.","\u201cWoe to you! For you build the sepulchers of the prophets
 and your fathers killed them.","\u201cTruly you bear witness and approve the deeds of your fathers. For they killed them
 and you build their sepulchers.","\u201cTherefore the wisdom of God said
 \u2018I will send them prophets and apostles. And of them they shall kill and persecute
\u2019","\u201cso that the blood of all the prophets
 shed from the foundation of the world
 may be required of this generation
","\u201cfrom the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah (who was killed between the altar and the Temple) truly I say to you
 it shall be required of this generation.","\u201cWoe to you
 lawyers! For you have taken away the key of knowledge. You did not enter in yourselves
 and those who came in you hindered.\u201d","In the meantime
 there gathered together an innumerable multitude of people
 so that they trampled one another. And He began to say to His disciples first
 \u201cBeware the leaven of the Pharisees
 which is hypocrisy.","\u201cFor there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed or hidden that shall not be known.","\u201cTherefore
 whatever you have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light. And that which you have spoken in the ear
 in secret places
 shall be preached on the houses.","\u201cAnd I say to you
 my friends
 do not be afraid of those who kill the body
 but after that are not able to do anymore.","\u201cBut I will forewarn you of Whom you shall fear. Fear Him Who
 after He has killed
 has power to cast into hell. Yes
 I say to you
 fear Him.","\u201cAre not five sparrows bought for two assaria? Yet not one of them is forgotten before God.","\u201cYes
 and all the hairs of your head are numbered. Therefore
 do not fear. You are of more value than many sparrows.","\u201cAlso I say to you whoever shall confess Me before men
 him shall the Son of Man also confess before the angels of God.","\u201cBut whoever shall deny Me before men shall be denied before the angels of God.","\u201cAnd whoever shall speak a word against the Son of Man
 it shall be forgiven him. But to him who shall blaspheme the Holy Ghost
 it shall not be forgiven.","\u201cAnd when they shall bring you to the synagogues
 and to the rulers and princes
 take no thought how or what you shall answer
 or what you shall speak.","\u201cFor the Holy Ghost shall teach you at the same hour what you ought to say.","And He said to him
 \u201cMan
 who made Me a judge or a divider over you?\u201d","Therefore He said to them
 \u201cPerceive and beware of covetousness. For though one has abundance
 his life does not consist of his riches.\u201d","And He put forth a parable to them
 saying
 \u201cThe ground of a certain rich man brought forth fruits plentifully.","\u201cTherefore he thought to himself
 saying
 \u2018What shall I do? I have no place to store my fruits?\u2019","\u201cAnd He said
 \u2018I will do this. I will pull down my barns and build bigger ones. And I will gather all my grain and my goods in there.","\u2018And I will say to my soul
 \u201cSoul
 you have many goods laid up for many years. Live at ease. Eat
 drink
 and be merry!\u201d","\u201cBut God said to him
 \u2018O fool! This night your soul shall be required from you. Then whose things shall those be which you have provided?","\u201cSo is the one who gathers riches for himself and is not rich toward God.\u201d","And He spoke to His disciples
 \u201cTherefore I say to you take no thought for your life (what you shall eat) or for your body (what you shall wear).","\u201cLife is more than food
 and the body than the clothing.","\u201cConsider the ravens. For they neither sow nor reap. Nor do they have storehouse or barn. And yet God feeds them. How much better are you than birds?","\u201cAnd who of you by worrying can add one cubit to his stature?","\u201cIf you then are not able to do the least thing
 why do you worry about the rest?","\u201cConsider how the lilies grow. They neither labor nor spin. Yet I say to you that Solomon himself
 in all his royalty
 was not clothed like one of these.","\u201cIf then God so clothes the grass (which is in the field today
 and tomorrow is cast into the oven) how much more will he clothe you? O you of little faith!","\u201cTherefore
 do not ask what you shall eat or what you shall drink
 or have an anxious mind.","\u201cFor the people of the world all seek for such things. And your Father knows that you need these things.","\u201cBut rather
 seek the Kingdom of God
 and all these things shall be added to you.","\u201cDo not fear
 little flock. For it is your Father\u2019s pleasure to give you the Kingdom.","\u201cSell what you have and give alms. Make purses which do not grow old - a treasure that can never fail in Heaven - where no thief comes or moth destroys.","\u201cFor where your treasure is
 there your hearts will be also.","\u201cLet your waist be girded
 your lights burning
","\u201cand you yourselves like men who wait for their master to return from the wedding feast. So that when he comes and knocks
 they may open to him immediately.","\u201cBlessed those servants whom the Lord shall find awake when He comes. Truly I say to you
 He will gird himself
 make them sit down at table
 and come forth and serve them.","\u201cAnd if He comes in the second watch
 or comes in the third watch
 and shall find them so
 blessed are those servants.","\u201cNow understand this: that if the good man of the house had known at what hour the thief would have come
 he would have watched
 and would not have allowed his house to be broken into.","\u201cTherefore
 you also be prepared. For the Son of Man will come at an hour you do not suspect.\u201d","And the Lord said
 \u201cWho is a faithful steward
 and wise; whom the master shall make ruler over his household
 to give them their portion of food in season?","\u201cBlessed is that servant whom his master
 when he comes
 shall find so doing.","\u201cTruly
 I say to you that he will make him ruler over all that he has.","\u201cBut if that servant says in his heart
 \u2018My master delays his coming\u2019
 and begins to beat the servants and maidens
 and to eat and drink and get drunk
","\u201cthe master of that servant will come on a day he does not suspect
 and at an hour when he is unaware
 and will cut him off
 and give him his portion with the unbelievers.","\u201cAnd that servant who knew his master\u2019s will and neither prepared himself nor did according to his will
 shall be beaten with many lashes.","\u201cBut the one who did not know it and still committed things worthy of lashes
 shall be beaten with few. For to whom much is given
 much shall be required. And to whom much has been committed
 much more will be requested.","\u201cI have come to cast fire on the earth
 and how I wish it were already kindled!","\u201cBut I must be baptized with a baptism
 and how I am grieved till it be accomplished.","\u201cDo you think that I have come to give peace on earth? I tell you no
 but rather division.","\u201cFor from now on there shall be five in one house divided
 three against two
 and two against three.","\u201cThe father shall be divided against the son
 and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter
 and the daughter against the mother; the mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law
 and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.\u201d","Then He said to the people
 \u201cWhen you see a cloud rise out of the west
 immediately you say
 \u2018A shower comes.\u2019 And so it does.","\u201cAnd when the south wind blows
 you say that it will be hot. And it happens.","\u201cHypocrites! You can discern the face of the earth and of the sky. But why can you not discern this time?","\u201cIndeed
 and why do you not judge what is right even among yourselves?","\u201cWhile you go with your adversary to the ruler
 work diligently on the way to be delivered from him. Lest he draws you to the judge and the judge delivers you to the jailer. And the jailer casts you into prison.","I tell you
 you shall not depart from there till you have paid the last cent.","And Jesus answered
 and said to them
 \u201cDo you suppose that because they have suffered such things
 these Galileans were greater sinners than all the other Galileans?","\u201cI tell you no. But unless you repent
 you shall all likewise perish.","\u201cOr do you think that those eighteen upon whom the tower in Siloam fell (and it killed them) were sinners above all men living in Jerusalem?","\u201cI tell you no. But unless you repent
 you shall all likewise perish.\u201d","He also spoke this parable: \u201cA certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard. And he came and sought fruit from it and found none.","\u201cThen he said to the dresser of his vineyard
 \u2018Behold
 for three years I have come and sought fruit from this fig tree and found none. Cut it down! Why is it wasting ground?\u2019","\u201cAnd he answered
 and said to him
 \u2018Lord
 let it alone this year also
 until I dig around it and fertilize it.","\u2018And if it bears fruit
 well. If not
 then after that cut it down.\u2019\u201d","When Jesus saw her
 He called her to Him
 and said to her
 \u201cWoman
 you are free from your disease.\u201d","Then the Lord answered him
 and said
 \u201cHypocrite. Does not each one of you free his ox or his ass from the stall on the Sabbath and lead him away to the water?","\u201cAnd ought not this daughter of Abraham (whom Satan has bound
 lo
 eighteen years) be freed from this bond on the Sabbath day?\u201d","Then He said
 \u201cWhat is the Kingdom of God like? Or
 to what shall I compare it?","\u201cIt is like a grain of mustard seed
 which a man took and sowed in his garden. And it grew and became a great tree. And the birds of the heaven made nests in its branches.\u201d","And again He said
 \u201cTo what shall I liken the Kingdom of God?","\u201cIt is like leaven. Which a woman took and hid in three pecks of flour
 till it all was leavened.\u201d","Then someone said to Him
 \u201cLord
 are there few who shall be saved?\u201d And He said to them
","\u201cStrive to enter in at the narrow gate. For many
 I say to you
 will seek to enter in and shall not be able.","\u201cWhen the master of the house has risen up and has shut the door; and you began to stand outside and to knock at the door

 \u2018Lord

 \u2018I do not know where you are from.\u2019","\u201cThen you shall begin to say
 \u2018We have eaten and drunk in your presence
 and you have taught in our streets.\u2019","\u201cBut he shall say
 \u2018I tell you. I do not know where you are from. Depart from me
 all you workers of iniquity!\u2019","\u201cThere shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you shall see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the Prophets in the Kingdom of God; and yourselves thrust out at doors.","\u201cThen many shall come from the east and from the west and from the north and from the south and shall sit at table in the Kingdom of God.","\u201cAnd behold
 there are last who shall be first. And there are first who shall be last.\u201d","Then He said to them

 spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees

 \u2018Give this man that place.\u2019 And then you begin (with shame) to take the lowest place.","\u201cBut when you are invited
 go and sit down at the lowest place. So that when the one who invited you comes
 he may say to you
 \u2018Friend
 sit up higher.\u2019 Then you shall have honor in the presence of those who sit at table with you.","\u201cFor whoever exalts himself
 shall be brought low. And the one who humbles himself
 shall be exalted.\u201d","Then He also said to the one who had invited Him
 \u201cWhen you make a dinner or a supper
 do not call your friends or your brothers or your kinsmen or the rich neighbors
 so that they invite you in return
 and a recompense be made to you.","\u201cBut when you make a feast
 call the poor
 the maimed
 the lame
 the blind.","\u201cAnd you shall be blessed
 because they cannot repay you. For you shall be recompensed at the Resurrection of the Just.","Now when one of them who sat at table heard these things
 he said to Him
 \u201cBlessed is he who eats bread in the Kingdom of God.\u201d","Then He said to him
 \u201cA certain man made a great supper
 and invited many
","\u201cand sent his servant at supper time to say to those were invited
 \u2018Come. For all things are now ready.\u2019","\u201cBut they all
 with one mind
 began to make excuses. The first said to him
 \u2018I have bought a farm
 and I must go out and see it. I ask you to have me excused.\u2019","\u201cAnd another said
 \u2018I have bought five yoke of oxen. And I go to test them. I ask that you have me excused.\u2019","\u201cAnd another said
 \u2018I have married a wife. And therefore
 I cannot come.\u2019","\u201cSo that servant returned and told his master these things. Then the good man of the house was angry
 and said to his servant
 \u2018Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city! And bring the poor in here
 and the maimed
 and the lame
 and the blind!\u2019","\u201cAnd the servant said
 \u2018Lord
 it is done as you have commanded. And still there is room.\u2019","\u201cThen the master said to the servant
 \u2018Go out to the highways and hedges and urge them to come in
 so that my house may be filled.","\u2018For I say to you that none of those who were invited shall taste of my supper.\u2019\u201d","Now great multitudes went with Him. And He turned and said to them
","\u201cIf anyone comes to Me
 and does not hate his father
 and mother
 and wife
 and children
 and brethren
 and sisters - yes
 and even his own life - he cannot be My disciple.","\u201cAnd whoever does not bear his cross and come after Me
 cannot be My disciple.","\u201cFor who of you
 intending to build a tower
 does not sit down beforehand and count the cost (whether he has the means to complete it)
","\u201clest after he has laid the foundation and is not able to complete it
 all who behold it begin to mock him
","\u201csaying
 \u2018This man began to build and was not able to finish.\u2019","Or what king - going to make war against another king - does not first sit down and take counsel on whether he is able (with ten thousand) to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand?","\u201cOtherwise
 while he is still a great way off
 he sends ambassadors to ask for peace.","\u201cSo likewise
 whoever of you who does not forsake all that he has cannot be My disciple.","\u201cSalt is good. But if salt has lost its savor
 with what shall it be salted?","\u201cIt is fit neither for the land nor for manure. But it is cast out. The one who has ears to hear
 let him hear.\u201d","\u201cWhat man of you
 having a hundred sheep
 if he loses one of them
 does not leave ninety-nine in the wilderness and go after that which is lost until he finds it?","\u201cAnd when he has found it
 he lays it on his shoulders with joy.","\u201cAnd when he comes home
 he calls together his friends and neighbors
 saying to them
 \u2018Rejoice with me! For I have found my sheep which was lost!\u2019","\u201cI say to you that joy shall likewise be in Heaven for one sinner who converts
 more than for ninety-nine righteous ones who have no need of repentance.","\u201cOr what woman having ten drachmas
 if she loses one drachma
 does not light a candle and sweep the house and seek diligently till she finds it?","\u201cAnd when she has found it
 she calls her friends and neighbors
 saying
 \u2018Rejoice with me! For I have found the coin which I had lost!\u2019","\u201cLikewise I say to you there is joy in the presence of the angels of God for one sinner who converts.\u201d","He said moreover
 \u201cA certain man had two sons.","\u201cAnd the younger of them said to his father
 \u2018Father
 give me the portion of the goods that falls to me.\u2019 So
 he divided his livelihood among them.","\u201cSo
 not many days after
 when the younger son had gathered everything together
 he took his journey into a far country. And there he wasted his goods with riotous living.","\u201cNow
 when he had spent everything
 there arose a great famine throughout that land. And he began to be in want.","\u201cThen he went and kept company with a citizen of that country. And he sent him to his farm to feed swine.","\u201cAnd he would have filled his belly with the husks that the swine ate
 but no one gave him any.","\u201cThen he came to himself and said
 \u2018How many of my father\u2019s hired servants have enough bread
 and I die for hunger?","\u2018I will rise and go to my father
 and say to him
 \u201cFather
 I have sinned against Heaven
 and before you
","\u201cand am no more worthy to be called your son. Make me as one of your hired servants.\u201d\u2019","\u201cSo he arose and came to his father. And when he was still a great way off
 his father saw him
 and had compassion
 and ran and fell on his neck
 and kissed him.","\u201cAnd the son said to him
 \u2018Father
 I have sinned against Heaven
 and before you
 and am no more worthy to be called your son.\u2019","\u201cThen the father said to his servants
 \u2018Bring forth the best robe and put it on him! And put a ring on his hand
 and shoes on his feet!","\u2018And bring the fat calf and kill him! And let us eat and be merry!","\u2018For this my son was dead
 and is alive again! And he was lost
 but he is found!\u2019 And they began to be merry.","\u201cNow the elder brother was in the field. And when he came and drew near to the house
 he heard melody and dancing
","\u201cAnd he called one of his servants and asked what those things meant.","\u201cAnd he said to him
 \u2018Your brother has come. And your father has killed the fat calf because he has received him safe and sound.\u2019","\u201cThen he was angry
 and would not go in. Therefore
 his father came out and implored him.","\u201cBut he answered
 and said to his father
 \u2018Lo
 these many years I have done you service and have always obeyed you! And yet you never gave me a kid that I might make merry with my friends!","\u2018But when this
 your son
 had come - who had devoured your goods with harlots - you have killed the fat calf for his sake!\u2019","\u201cAnd he said to him
 \u201cSon
 you are always with me. And all that I have is yours. It was fitting that we should celebrate and be glad. For this
 your brother
 was dead
 and is alive again. And he was lost
 but he is found.\u201d","And He also said to His disciples
 \u201cThere was a certain rich man who had a steward. And he was accused to him of wasting his goods.","\u201cAnd he called him and said to him
 \u2018How is it that I hear this of you? Give an account of your stewardship. For you may no longer be steward.\u2019","\u201cThen the steward said within himself
 \u2018What shall I do? For my master is taking away the stewardship from me. I cannot dig. And I am ashamed to beg.","\u2018I know what I will do
 so that when I am put out of the stewardship they may receive me into their houses.\u2019","\u201cThen he called every one of his master\u2019s debtors to him
 and said to the first
 \u2018How much do you owe to my master?\u2019","\u201cAnd he said
 \u2018A hundred measures of oil.\u2019 And he said to him
 \u2018Take your bill. And sit down quickly. And write fifty.\u2019","\u201cThen he said to another
 \u2018How much do you owe?\u2019 And he said
 \u2018A hundred measures of wheat.\u2019 Then he said to him
 \u2018Take your bill and write eighty.\u2019","\u201cAnd the master commended the unjust steward
 because he had done wisely. For among their own kind
 the children of this world are wiser than the children of light.","\u201cAnd I say to you
 make friends with the riches of iniquity
 so that when you fail
 they may receive you into eternal dwellings.","\u201cThe one who is faithful in the least
 is also faithful in much. And the one who is unjust in the least
 is unjust also in much.","\u201cIf
 then
 you have not been faithful in the riches of iniquity
 who will trust you in the true treasure?","\u201cAnd if you have not been faithful in another man\u2019s goods
 who shall give you that which is yours?","\u201cNo servant can serve two masters. For either he shall hate the one and love the other. Or else he shall lean to the one
 and despise the other. You cannot serve God and riches.\u201d","Then He said to them
 \u201cYou are those who justify yourselves before men. But God knows your hearts. For that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.","\u201cThe Law and the Prophets endured until John. And since that time the Kingdom of God is preached. And everyone presses into it.","\u201cNow it is easier for Heaven and earth to pass away than for one stroke of the Law to fall.","\u201cWhoever puts away his wife and marries another
 commits adultery. And whoever marries the one who is put away from her husband
 commits adultery.","\u201cThere was a certain rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and fared well and delicately every day.","\u201cAlso
 there was a certain beggar named Lazarus
 who was laid at his gate (full of sores).","\u201cAnd he desired to be refreshed with the crumbs that fell from the rich man\u2019s table. And even the dogs came and licked his sores.","\u201cAnd it happened that the beggar died and was carried by the angels into Abraham\u2019s bosom. The rich man also died and was buried.","\u201cAnd being in torment in hell
 he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham far off (and Lazarus in his bosom).","\u201cThen he cried and said
 \u2018Father Abraham
 have mercy on me! And send Lazarus
 so that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue! For I am tormented in this flame!\u2019","\u201cBut Abraham said
 \u2018Son
 remember that you
 in your lifetime
 received your pleasures
 and likewise Lazarus pains. Therefore
 now he is comforted and you are tormented.","\u2018Besides all this
 there is a great gulf set between you and us
 so that those who wish to go from here to you
 cannot. Nor can anyone come from there to us.\u2019","\u201cThen he said
 \u2018Therefore I ask you
 father
 if you would send him to my father\u2019s house
","\u2018(for I have five brothers) so that he may testify to them
 lest they also come into this place of torment.\u2019","\u201cAbraham said to him
 \u2018They have Moses and the Prophets. Let them hear them.\u2019","\u201cAnd he said
 \u2018No
 father Abraham. But if one came to them from the dead
 they will repent.\u2019","\u201cThen he said to him
 \u2018If they do not hear Moses and the Prophets
 they will not be persuaded if one rises from the dead again.\u2019\u201d","Then He said to His disciples
 \u201cIt is impossible for stumbling blocks not to come. But
 but woe to him by whom they come.","\u201cIt would be better for him if a great millstone were hung around his neck and he were cast into the sea
 than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble.","\u201cPay attention to yourselves. If your brother trespasses against you
 rebuke him. And if he repents
 forgive him.","\u201cAnd if he sins against you seven times in a day
 and seven times in a day turns again to you
 saying
 \u201cI repent\u201d
 you shall forgive him.\u201d","And the Lord said
 \u201cIf you had faith as a grain of mustard seed
 you could say to this mulberry tree
 \u2018Pluck yourself up by the roots and plant yourself in the sea\u2019
 and it would obey you.","\u201cAlso
 who of you
 having a servant plowing or feeding cattle
 would say to him when he comes from the field
 \u2018Come at once
 and sit down to eat?\u2019","\u201cWould you not rather say to him
 \u2018Prepare my supper and dress yourself. And serve me until I have eaten and drunk. And you eat and drink afterward?\u2019","\u201cDoes he thank that servant because he did that which was commanded? I think not.","\u201cSo likewise you
 when you have done all those things which are commanded of you
 say
 \u2018We are unprofitable servants. We have done that which was our duty to do.\u2019\u201d","And so it was when He went to Jerusalem
 that He passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.","And when He saw
 He said to them
 \u201cGo. Show yourselves to the priests.\u201d And it happened that as they went
 they were cleansed.","And Jesus answered
 and said
 \u201cAre there not ten cleansed? But where are the nine?","\u201cThere is no one found who returned to give God praise
 except this stranger?\u201d","And He said to him
 \u201cArise. Go your way. Your faith has saved you.\u201d","And when He was asked by the Pharisees when the Kingdom of God would come
 He answered them
 and said
 \u201cThe Kingdom of God does not come with observation.","\u201cNor shall they say
 \u2018Lo
 here!\u2019 or \u201cLo
 there!\u2019 For behold
 the Kingdom of God is within you.\u201d","And He said to the disciples
 \u201cThe days will come when you shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man
 and you shall not see it.","\u201cThen they shall say to you
 \u2018Behold here!\u2019or \u2018Behold there!\u2019 Do not go there or follow them.","\u201cFor as the lightning that flashes out of one part of heaven
 shines into another part of heaven
 so shall the Son of Man be in his day.","\u201cBut first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.","\u201cAnd as it was in the days of Noah
 so shall it be in the days of the Son of Man.","\u201cThey ate
 they drank
 they married wives and gave in marriage
 until the day that Noah went into the Ark. And the flood came and destroyed them all.","\u201cAlso
 as it was in the days of Lot. They ate
 they drank
 they bought
 they sold
 they planted
 they built.","But on the day that Lot went out of Sodom
 it rained fire and brimstone from heaven
 and destroyed them all.","\u201cSo shall it be on the day when the Son of Man is revealed.","\u201cOn that day
 the one who is upon the house (and his stuff in the house)
 let him not come down to take it out. And likewise
 the one who is in the field
 let him not turn back to that which he left behind.","\u201cRemember Lot\u2019s wife.","\u201cWhoever will seek to save his soul
 shall lose it. And whoever shall lose it
 shall preserve it.","\u201cI tell you
 on that night there shall be two in one bed. The one shall be received
 and the other shall be left.","\u201cTwo women shall be grinding together. The one shall be taken
 and the other shall be left.","And they answered
 and said to Him
 \u201cWhere
 Lord?\u201d And He said to them
 \u201cWherever the body is
 there also shall the birds of prey be gathered together.\u201d","He said
 \u201cThere was a judge in a certain city who neither feared God nor respected man.","\u201cAnd there was a widow in that city who came to him saying
 \u2018Do me justice against my adversary.\u2019","\u201cAnd he would not do so for some time. But then
 he said to himself
 \u2018I neither fear God nor respect man.","\u2018Yet because this widow troubles me I will do her right
 lest she keeps coming and makes me weary.\u2019\u201d","And the Lord said
 \u201cHear what the unrighteous judge says.","\u201cNow
 shall not God avenge His Elect
 who cry day and night to Him
 even though He bears with them a long time?","\u201cI tell you
 He will avenge them quickly! But
 when the Son of Man comes
 shall He find faith on the earth?\u201d","\u201cTwo men went up into the Temple to pray - the one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.","\u201cThe Pharisee stood and prayed to himself like this: \u2018O God
 I thank You that I am not as other men - extortioners
 unjust
 adulterers - or even as this tax collector.","\u2018I fast twice a week. I give tithe of all that ever I possess.\u2019","\u201cBut the tax collector
 standing at a distance
 would not lift up so much as his eyes to Heaven. But he struck his breast
 saying
 \u2018O God
 be merciful to me
 a sinner.\u2019","\u201cI tell you
 this man departed to his house more justified than the other. For everyone who exalts himself shall be brought low. And the one who humbles himself shall be exalted.\u201d","But Jesus called them to Him
 and said
 \u201cLet the little children come to Me
 and do not forbid them. For of such is the Kingdom of God.","\u201cTruly I say to you
 whoever does not receive the Kingdom of God as a little child
 shall not enter therein.\u201d","And Jesus said to him
 \u201cWhy do you call Me good? No one is good except One - God.","\u201cYou know the commandments
 \u2018You shall not commit adultery. You shall not kill. You shall not steal. You shall not bear false witness. Honor your father and your mother.\u201d","And he said
 \u201cAll these have I kept from my youth!\u201d","Now when Jesus heard that
 He said to him
 \u201cStill
 you lack one thing. Sell all that you have and distribute it to the poor. And you shall have treasure in Heaven. And come follow Me.\u201d","And when Jesus saw he was very sorrowful
 He said
 \u201cHow difficult it is for those who have riches to enter into the Kingdom of God!","\u201cSurely it is easier for a camel to go through a needle\u2019s eye
 than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God.\u201d","And He said
 \u201cThe things which are impossible with men are possible with God.\u201d","[p]And He said to them
 \u201cTruly I say to you there is no one who has left house
 or parents
 or brothers
 or wife

 eternal life.","Then Jesus took the twelve to Him and said to them
 \u201cBehold
 we go up to Jerusalem. And all things that are written of the Son of Man by the Prophets shall be fulfilled.","\u201cFor He shall be delivered to the Gentiles

 and shall be mistreated
 and shall be spit upon.","\u201cAnd when they have scourged Him
 they will put Him to death. But the third day He shall rise again.\u201d","But they understood none of these things. And this saying was hidden from them. Nor did they perceive the things which were spoken.","saying
 \u201cWhat would you have Me do for you?\u201d And he said
 \u201cLord
 that I may receive my sight.\u201d","And Jesus said to him
 \u201cReceive your sight. Your faith has saved you.","And when Jesus came to the place
 He looked up and saw him
 and said to him
 \u201cZacchaeus! Come down at once! For today I must stay at your house!\u201d","But Zacchaeus
 standing
 said to the Lord

 \u201cToday
 salvation has come to this house! Because he has also become the son of Abraham!","\u201cFor the Son of Man has come to seek and to save those who have been lost.\u201d","Therefore
 He said
 \u201cA certain nobleman went into a distant country to receive a kingdom for himself and then to return.","\u201cAnd he called his ten servants

 his citizens hated him

 your mina has increased to five minas.\u2019","\u201cAnd to this one he said

 \u2018From your own mouth will I judge you
 O evil servant! You knew that I am an exacting man
 taking up what I did not lay down and reaping what I did not sow.","\u2018Why
 then
 did you not give my money to the bank
 so that I might have required it with interest when I came?\u2019","\u201cAnd he said to those who stood by
 \u2018Take the mina from him and give it to him who has ten minas!\u2019","\u201cAnd they said to him
 \u2018Lord
 he has ten minas.\u2019","\u2018For I say to you that to all those who have
 it shall be given. And from the one who has not

 he sent a servant to the farmers to have them give him of the fruit of the vineyard. But the farmers beat him and sent him away empty.","\u201cAgain
 he sent yet another servant. And they beat him
 and treated him badly
 and sent him away empty.","\u201cMoreover he sent the third. And they wounded him and cast him out.","\u201cThen the Lord said of the vineyard
 \u2018What shall I do? I will send my beloved son. It may be that they will respect him.\u2019","\u201cBut when the farmers saw him
 they reasoned with themselves
 saying
 \u2018This is the heir. Come
 let us kill him
 so that the inheritance may be ours.\u2019","\u201cSo they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him. Therefore
 what shall the Lord of the vineyard do to them?","\u201cHe will come and destroy these farmers and will give his vineyard to others.\u201d But when they heard it
 they said
 \u201cMay it never be!\u201d","And He looked at them

 \u201cTruly I say to you that this poor widow has cast in more than all of them.","\u201cFor they have all cast into the offerings of God out of their excess. But she
 out of her poverty
 has cast in all her livelihood.\u201d","\u201cAre these the things that you look upon? The days will come when a stone shall not be left upon a stone; that it shall not be thrown down.\u201d","And He said
 \u201cWatch carefully
 so that you are not deceived. For many will come in My Name
 saying
 \u2018I am Christ
\u2019 and \u2018The time draws near.\u2019 Therefore
 do not follow them.","\u201cAnd when you hear of wars and revolutions
 do not be afraid. For these things must come first. But the end will not follow right away.\u201d","Then He said to them
 \u201cNation shall rise against nation
 and kingdom against kingdom.","\u201cAnd great earthquakes shall occur in diverse places. And hunger and pestilence and fearful things and great signs from Heaven shall happen.","\u201cBut before all these things
 they shall lay their hands on you and persecute you - delivering you up to the assemblies and into prisons - and bring you before kings and rulers
 for My Name\u2019s sake.","\u201cAnd this shall result in a testimonial for you.","\u201cTherefore
 resolve in your hearts not to prepare what you shall answer beforehand.","\u201cFor I will give you a mouth
 and wisdom
 against which all your adversaries shall not be able to speak or resist.","\u201cIndeed
 you shall also be betrayed by your parents and by your brothers
 and kinsmen
 and friends. And they shall put you to death.","\u201cAnd you shall be hated by all
 for My Name\u2019s sake.","\u201cYet
 not one hair of your heads shall perish.","\u201cBy your patience
 gain your souls.","\u201cAnd when you see Jerusalem besieged by soldiers
 then understand that its desolation is near.","\u201cThen let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. And let those who are in the city depart. And do not let those who are in the country enter.","\u201cFor these are the days of vengeance
 to fulfill all things that are written.","\u201cBut woe to those who are with child
 and to those who nurse
 in those days. For there shall be great distress in this land
 and wrath over this people.","\u201cAnd they shall fall on the edge of the sword and shall be led as captives into all nations. And Jerusalem shall be trampled under the feet of the Gentiles
 until the time of the Gentiles be fulfilled.","\u201cThen there shall be signs in the sun
 and in the moon
 and in the stars
 and trouble upon the earth among the nations
 with confusion. The sea and the waters shall roar.","And men\u2019s hearts shall fail them for fear and for looking after those things which shall come upon the world. For the powers of Heaven shall be shaken.","\u201cAnd then shall they see the Son of Man come in a cloud
 with power and great glory.","\u201cAnd when these things begin to happen
 then look up and lift up your heads! For your redemption draws near!\u201d","And He spoke to them a parable
 \u201cLook at the fig tree
 and all trees
","\u201cas they now spring forth. When you see them
 you know that summer is now near.","\u201cSo likewise
 when you see these things happen
 you know that the Kingdom of God is near.","\u201cTruly I say to you this age shall not pass until all things are done.","\u201cHeaven and Earth shall pass away
 but My words shall not pass away.","\u201cPay attention to yourselves
 so that your hearts are never oppressed with excess and drunkenness and cares of this life. And so that the Day does not take you by surprise.","\u201cFor it shall come as a trap upon all those who dwell on the face of the whole earth.","\u201cWatch
 therefore
 and pray continually. So that you may be counted worthy to escape all these things that shall happen. And so that you may stand before the Son of Man.\u201d","And He sent Peter and John
 saying
 \u201cGo and prepare the Passover for us
 so that we may eat it.\u201d","Then He said to them
 \u201cBehold
 when you have entered into the city

 \u2018The Master says to you
 \u201cWhere is the lodging where I shall eat My Passover with My disciples?\u201d\u2019","\u201cThen he will show you a large
 furnished upper room. Make it ready there.\u201d","Then He said to them
 \u201cI have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.","\u201cFor I say to you that I will not eat of it again until it is fulfilled in the Kingdom of God.\u201d","And He took the cup
 and gave thanks
 and said
 \u201cTake this
 and divide it among you.\u201d","For I say to you that I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the Kingdom of God comes.\u201d","And He took bread. And when He had given thanks
 He broke it
 and gave it to them

 \u201cThis is My body
 which is given for you. Do this in the remembrance of Me.\u201d","Likewise
 after supper
 He took the cup
 saying
 \u201cThis cup is the New Testament in My blood
 which is shed for you.","\u201cStill
 the hand of him who betrays Me is with Me at the table.","\u201cAnd truly the Son of Man goes as it is appointed. But woe to that man by whom He is betrayed.\u201d","But He said to them
 \u201cThe kings of the Gentiles reign over them. And those who bear rule over them are called benefactors.","\u201cBut you shall not be so. But let the greatest among you be as the least; and the chief as he who serves.","\u201cFor who is greater
 the one who sits at table
 or the one who serves? Is not the one who sits at table? And I am among you as one who serves.","\u201cAnd you are those who have continued with Me in My trials.","\u201cTherefore I appoint to you a kingdom
 as my Father has appointed to Me
","\u201cSo that you may eat and drink at My table
 in My kingdom; and sit on seats and judge the twelve tribes of Israel.","And the Lord said
 \u201cSimon. Simon
 behold! Satan has asked for you
 to sift you as wheat.","\u201cBut I have prayed for you
 that your faith does not fail. Therefore
 when you have repented
 strengthen your brothers.\u201d","And he said to Him. \u201cLord
 I am ready to go with You into prison
 and to death!\u201d","But He said
 \u201cI tell you
 Peter
 the cock shall not crow this day

 \u201cWhen I sent you without bag and purse and shoes
 did you lack anything?\u201d And they said
 \u201cNothing.\u201d","Then He said to them
 \u201cBut now he who has a bag
 let him take it
 and likewise a purse. And he who has none
 let him sell his coat
 and buy a sword.","\u201cFor I say to you that the same which is written must still be performed in Me: \u2018He was numbered with the wicked.\u2019 For doubtless those things which are written of Me have an end.\u201d","And they said
 \u201cLord
 behold
 here are two swords.\u201d And He said to them
 \u201cIt is enough.\u201d","And when He came to the place
 He said to them
 \u201cPray
 lest you enter into temptation.\u201d","saying
 \u201cFather. If You will
 take away this cup from Me. Nevertheless
 not My will. But Yours be done.\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cWhy do you sleep?! Rise and pray
 lest you enter into temptation.\u201d","And Jesus said to him
 \u201cJudas
 you betray the Son of Man with a kiss?\u201d","Then Jesus answered
 and said
 \u201cEnough!\u201d And He touched his ear and healed him.","Then Jesus said to the chief priests
 and captains of the Temple

 with swords and clubs?","\u201cWhen I was with you daily in the Temple
 you did not stretch forth hands against Me. But this is your hour
 and the power of darkness!\u201d","Then the Lord turned back and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord; how He had said to him

 you shall deny Me three times.\u201d","saying
 \u201cAre You the Christ? Tell us!\u201d And He said to them
 \u201cIf I tell you
 you will not believe it.","\u201cAnd also
 if I ask you
 you will not answer Me
 nor let Me go.","\u201cFrom now on
 the Son of Man shall sit at the right hand of the power of God.","Then they all said

 then
 the Son of God?!\u201d And He said to them
 \u201cYou say that I am.\u201d","And Pilate asked Him

 he asked whether the Man was a Galilean.","and said to them
 \u201cYou have brought this Man to me as one Who perverted the people! And behold

 \u201cBut
 what evil has He done? I find no cause for death in Him! I will therefore discipline Him and let Him loose!\u201d","But Jesus turned back to them
 and said
 \u201cDaughters of Jerusalem
 do not weep for Me. But weep for yourselves

 the days will come when it shall be said

 \u2018Fall on us!\u2019 and to the hills
 \u2018Cover us!\u2019","\u201cFor if they do these things to a green tree
 what shall be done to the dry?\u201d","Then Jesus said

 forgive them! For they do not know what they do!\u201d And they divided His clothing and cast lots.","Then Jesus said to him
 \u201cTruly I say to you
 today you shall be with Me in Paradise.\u201d","And Jesus cried with a loud voice
 and said
 \u201cFather! Into Your hands I commend My spirit. And when He had said this
 He gave up the ghost.","And being afraid
 they bowed their faces down to the earth. They said to them
 \u201cWhy do you seek Him who lives among the dead?","And He said to them
 \u201cWhat kind of conversations are these that you are having as you walk and are sad?\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cWhat things?\u201d And they said to Him
 \u201cOf Jesus of Nazareth
 Who was a Prophet
 mighty in deed and in word before God and all people.","Then He said to them
 \u201cO fools! And slow of heart to believe all that the Prophets have spoken!","\u201cOught not Christ to have suffered these things
 and to enter into His glory?\u201d","And as they spoke these things
 Jesus Himself stood in the midst of them and said to them
 \u201cPeace to you.\u201d","Then He said to them
 \u201cWhy are you troubled? And why do doubts arise in your hearts?","\u201cLook at My hands and My feet. For it is I
 Myself. Touch Me and see. For a spirit does not have flesh and bones
 as you see I have.\u201d","And while they still did not believe for joy
 and wondered
 He said to them
 \u201cDo you have any food here?\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cThese are the words which I spoke to you while I was still with you - that all which is written of Me in the Law of Moses
 and in the Prophets
 and in the Psalms
 must be fulfilled.","And said to them
 \u201cThus is it written. And thus it was necessary for Christ to suffer and to rise again from the dead the third day
","and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His Name among all nations
 beginning at Jerusalem.","\u201cNow
 you are witnesses of these things.","And behold
 I send the promise of My Father upon you. But wait in the city of Jerusalem until you are filled with power from on high.\u201d","And he said to them
 \u201cHow is it that you sought me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father\u2019s house?\u201d ","And Jesus answered him
 \u201cIt is written
 \u2018Man shall not live by bread alone.\u2019\u201d ","and said to him
 \u201cTo you I will give all this authority and their glory; for it has been delivered to me
 and I give it to whom I will. ","And Jesus answered him
 \u201cIt is written
 \u2018You shall worship the Lord your God
 and him only shall you serve.\u2019\u201d","And he took him to Jerusalem
 and set him on the pinnacle of the temple
 and said to him
 \u201cIf you are the Son of God
 throw yourself down from here; ","And Jesus answered him
 \u201cIt is said
 \u2018You shall not tempt the Lord your God.\u2019\u201d ","\u201cThe Spirit of the Lord is upon me
 because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind
 to set at liberty those who are oppressed
","to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.\u201d","And he began to say to them
 \u201cToday this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cDoubtless you will quote to me this proverb
 \u2018Physician
 heal yourself; what we have heard you did at Caper\u2032na-um
 do here also in your own country.\u2019\u201d ","And he said
 \u201cTruly
 I say to you
 no prophet is acceptable in his own country. ","But in truth
 I tell you
 there were many widows in Israel in the days of Eli\u2032jah
 when the heaven was shut up three years and six months
 when there came a great famine over all the land; ","and Eli\u2032jah was sent to none of them but only to Zar\u2032ephath
 in the land of Sidon
 to a woman who was a widow. ","And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet Eli\u2032sha; and none of them was cleansed
 but only Na\u2032aman the Syrian.\u201d ","and they were astonished at his teaching
 for his word was with authority. ","But Jesus rebuked him
 saying
 \u201cBe silent
 and come out of him!\u201d And when the demon had thrown him down in the midst
 he came out of him
 having done him no harm. ","And demons also came out of many
 crying
 \u201cYou are the Son of God!\u201d But he rebuked them
 and would not allow them to speak
 because they knew that he was the Christ.","but he said to them
 \u201cI must preach the good news of the kingdom of God to the other cities also; for I was sent for this purpose.\u201d ","And when he had ceased speaking
 he said to Simon
 \u201cPut out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.\u201d ","and so also were James and John
 sons of Zeb\u2032edee
 who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon
 \u201cDo not be afraid; henceforth you will be catching men.\u201d ","And he stretched out his hand
 and touched him
 saying
 \u201cI will; be clean.\u201d And immediately the leprosy left him. ","And he charged him to tell no one; but \u201cgo and show yourself to the priest
 and make an offering for your cleansing
 as Moses commanded
 for a proof to the people.\u201d ","And when he saw their faith he said
 \u201cMan
 your sins are forgiven you.\u201d ","When Jesus perceived their questionings
 he answered them
 \u201cWhy do you question in your hearts? ","Which is easier
 to say
 \u2018Your sins are forgiven you
\u2019 or to say
 \u2018Rise and walk\u2019? ","But that you may know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins\u201d\u2014he said to the man who was paralyzed\u2014\u201cI say to you
 rise
 take up your bed and go home.\u201d ","After this he went out
 and saw a tax collector
 named Levi
 sitting at the tax office; and he said to him
 \u201cFollow me.\u201d ","And Jesus answered them
 \u201cThose who are well have no need of a physician
 but those who are sick; ","I have not come to call the righteous
 but sinners to repentance.\u201d","And they said to him
 \u201cThe disciples of John fast often and offer prayers
 and so do the disciples of the Pharisees
 but yours eat and drink.\u201d ","And Jesus said to them
 \u201cCan you make wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them? ","The days will come
 when the bridegroom is taken away from them
 and then they will fast in those days.\u201d ","He told them a parable also: \u201cNo one tears a piece from a new garment and puts it upon an old garment; if he does
 he will tear the new
 and the piece from the new will not match the old. ","And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; if he does
 the new wine will burst the skins and it will be spilled
 and the skins will be destroyed. ","But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins.","And no one after drinking old wine desires new; for he says
 \u2018The old is good.\u2019\u201d","And Jesus answered
 \u201cHave you not read what David did when he was hungry
 he and those who were with him: ","how he entered the house of God
 and took and ate the bread of the Presence
 which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat
 and also gave it to those with him?\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cThe Son of man is lord of the sabbath.\u201d","But he knew their thoughts
 and he said to the man who had the withered hand
 \u201cCome and stand here.\u201d And he rose and stood there. ","And Jesus said to them
 \u201cI ask you
 is it lawful on the sabbath to do good or to do harm
 to save life or to destroy it?\u201d ","And he looked around on them all
 and said to him
 \u201cStretch out your hand.\u201d And he did so
 and his hand was restored. ","\u201cBlessed are you that hunger now
 for you shall be satisfied. \u201cBlessed are you that weep now
 for you shall laugh.","\u201cBlessed are you when men hate you
 and when they exclude you and revile you
 and cast out your name as evil
 on account of the Son of man! ","Rejoice in that day
 and leap for joy
 for behold
 your reward is great in heaven; for so their fathers did to the prophets.","\u201cBut woe to you that are rich
 for you have received your consolation.","\u201cWoe to you that are full now
 for you shall hunger. \u201cWoe to you that laugh now
 for you shall mourn and weep.","\u201cWoe to you
 when all men speak well of you
 for so their fathers did to the false prophets.","\u201cBut I say to you that hear

 do good to those who hate you
 ","bless those who curse you
 pray for those who abuse you. ","To him who strikes you on the cheek
 offer the other also; and from him who takes away your coat do not withhold even your shirt. ","Give to every one who begs from you; and of him who takes away your goods do not ask them again.","And as you wish that men would do to you
 do so to them.","\u201cIf you love those who love you
 what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them. ","And if you do good to those who do good to you
 what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same. ","And if you lend to those from whom you hope to receive
 what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners
 to receive as much again. ","But love your enemies
 and do good
 and lend
 expecting nothing in return; and your reward will be great
 and you will be sons of the Most High; for he is kind to the ungrateful and the selfish. ","Be merciful
 even as your Father is merciful.","\u201cJudge not
 and you will not be judged; condemn not
 and you will not be condemned; forgive
 and you will be forgiven; ","give
 and it will be given to you; good measure
 pressed down
 shaken together
 running over
 will be put into your lap. For the measure you give will be the measure you get back.\u201d","He also told them a parable: \u201cCan a blind man lead a blind man? Will they not both fall into a pit?","A disciple is not above his teacher
 but every one when he is fully taught will be like his teacher. ","Why do you see the speck that is in your brother\u2019s eye
 but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? ","Or how can you say to your brother
 \u2018Brother
 let me take out the speck that is in your eye
\u2019 when you yourself do not see the log that is in your own eye? You hypocrite
 first take the log out of your own eye
 and then you will see clearly to take out the speck that is in your brother\u2019s eye.","\u201cFor no good tree bears bad fruit
 nor again does a bad tree bear good fruit; ","for each tree is known by its own fruit. For figs are not gathered from thorns
 nor are grapes picked from a bramble bush. ","The good man out of the good treasure of his heart produces good
 and the evil man out of his evil treasure produces evil; for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.","\u201cWhy do you call me \u2018Lord
 Lord
\u2019 and not do what I tell you? ","Every one who comes to me and hears my words and does them
 I will show you what he is like: ","he is like a man building a house
 who dug deep
 and laid the foundation upon rock; and when a flood arose
 the stream broke against that house
 and could not shake it
 because it had been well built. ","But he who hears and does not do them is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation; against which the stream broke
 and immediately it fell
 and the ruin of that house was great.\u201d","When Jesus heard this he marveled at him
 and turned and said to the multitude that followed him
 \u201cI tell you
 not even in Israel have I found such faith.\u201d ","And when the Lord saw her
 he had compassion on her and said to her
 \u201cDo not weep.\u201d ","And he came and touched the bier
 and the bearers stood still. And he said
 \u201cYoung man

 he began to speak to the crowds concerning John: \u201cWhat did you go out into the wilderness to behold? A reed shaken by the wind? ","What then did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft clothing? Behold
 those who are gorgeously appareled and live in luxury are in kings\u2019 courts. ","What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes
 I tell you

 \u2018Behold
 I send my messenger before thy face

 among those born of women none is greater than John; yet he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.\u201d ","\u201cTo what then shall I compare the men of this generation

 \u201cSimon
 I have something to say to you.\u201d And he answered
 \u201cWhat is it
 Teacher?\u201d ","\u201cA certain creditor had two debtors; one owed five hundred denarii
 and the other fifty. ","When they could not pay
 he forgave them both. Now which of them will love him more?\u201d ","Simon answered
 \u201cThe one
 I suppose

 \u201cYou have judged rightly.\u201d ","Then turning toward the woman he said to Simon
 \u201cDo you see this woman? I entered your house

 but she has anointed my feet with ointment. ","Therefore I tell you
 her sins
 which are many
 are forgiven

 loves little.\u201d ","And he said to her
 \u201cYour sins are forgiven.\u201d ","And he said to the woman
 \u201cYour faith has saved you; go in peace.\u201d","And when a great crowd came together and people from town after town came to him
 he said in a parable: ","\u201cA sower went out to sow his seed; and as he sowed
 some fell along the path
 and was trodden under foot

 it withered away
 because it had no moisture. ","And some fell among thorns; and the thorns grew with it and choked it.","And some fell into good soil and grew
 and yielded a hundredfold.\u201d As he said this
 he called out
 \u201cHe who has ears to hear
 let him hear.\u201d","he said
 \u201cTo you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of God; but for others they are in parables
 so that seeing they may not see
 and hearing they may not understand. ","Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.","The ones along the path are those who have heard; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts
 that they may not believe and be saved. ","And the ones on the rock are those who
 when they hear the word
 receive it with joy; but these have no root
 they believe for a while and in time of temptation fall away. ","And as for what fell among the thorns
 they are those who hear
 but as they go on their way they are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life
 and their fruit does not mature. ","And as for that in the good soil
 they are those who
 hearing the word
 hold it fast in an honest and good heart
 and bring forth fruit with patience.","\u201cNo one after lighting a lamp covers it with a vessel
 or puts it under a bed
 but puts it on a stand
 that those who enter may see the light. ","For nothing is hid that shall not be made manifest
 nor anything secret that shall not be known and come to light. ","Take heed then how you hear; for to him who has will more be given
 and from him who has not
 even what he thinks that he has will be taken away.\u201d","And he was told
 \u201cYour mother and your brothers are standing outside
 desiring to see you.\u201d ","But he said to them
 \u201cMy mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God and do it.\u201d","One day he got into a boat with his disciples

 \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d And he said
 \u201cLegion\u201d; for many demons had entered him. ","\u201cReturn to your home
 and declare how much God has done for you.\u201d And he went away
 proclaiming throughout the whole city how much Jesus had done for him.","And Jesus said
 \u201cWho was it that touched me?\u201d When all denied it
 Peter said
 \u201cMaster
 the multitudes surround you and press upon you!\u201d ","But Jesus said
 \u201cSome one touched me; for I perceive that power has gone forth from me.\u201d ","And he said to her
 \u201cDaughter
 your faith has made you well; go in peace.\u201d","But Jesus on hearing this answered him
 \u201cDo not fear; only believe
 and she shall be well.\u201d ","And all were weeping and bewailing her; but he said
 \u201cDo not weep; for she is not dead but sleeping.\u201d ","But taking her by the hand he called
 saying
 \u201cChild
 arise.\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cTake nothing for your journey
 no staff
 nor bag
 nor bread
 nor money; and do not have two tunics. ","And whatever house you enter
 stay there
 and from there depart. ","And wherever they do not receive you
 when you leave that town shake off the dust from your feet as a testimony against them.\u201d ","But he said to them
 \u201cYou give them something to eat.\u201d They said
 \u201cWe have no more than five loaves and two fish\u2014unless we are to go and buy food for all these people.\u201d ","For there were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples
 \u201cMake them sit down in companies
 about fifty each.\u201d ","Now it happened that as he was praying alone the disciples were with him; and he asked them
 \u201cWho do the people say that I am?\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cBut who do you say that I am?\u201d And Peter answered
 \u201cThe Christ of God.\u201d ","saying
 \u201cThe Son of man must suffer many things
 and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes
 and be killed
 and on the third day be raised.\u201d","And he said to all
 \u201cIf any man would come after me
 let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. ","For whoever would save his life will lose it; and whoever loses his life for my sake
 he will save it. ","For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses or forfeits himself?","For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words
 of him will the Son of man be ashamed when he comes in his glory and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels. ","But I tell you truly
 there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God.\u201d","And as the men were parting from him
 Peter said to Jesus
 \u201cMaster
 it is well that we are here; let us make three booths
 one for you and one for Moses and one for Eli\u2032jah\u201d\u2014not knowing what he said. ","Jesus answered
 \u201cO faithless and perverse generation
 how long am I to be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here.\u201d ","\u201cLet these words sink into your ears; for the Son of man is to be delivered into the hands of men.\u201d","and said to them
 \u201cWhoever receives this child in my name receives me
 and whoever receives me receives him who sent me; for he who is least among you all is the one who is great.\u201d","But Jesus said to him
 \u201cDo not forbid him; for he that is not against you is for you.\u201d","And Jesus said to him
 \u201cFoxes have holes
 and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man has nowhere to lay his head.\u201d ","To another he said
 \u201cFollow me.\u201d But he said
 \u201cLord
 let me first go and bury my father.\u201d ","But he said to him
 \u201cLeave the dead to bury their own dead; but as for you
 go and proclaim the kingdom of God.\u201d ","Jesus said to him
 \u201cNo one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God.\u201d","And he said to them
 \u201cThe harvest is plentiful
 but the laborers are few; pray therefore the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest. ","Go your way; behold
 I send you out as lambs in the midst of wolves. ","Carry no purse
 no bag
 no sandals; and salute no one on the road. ","Whatever house you enter
 first say
 \u2018Peace be to this house!\u2019 ","And if a son of peace is there
 your peace shall rest upon him; but if not
 it shall return to you. ","And remain in the same house
 eating and drinking what they provide
 for the laborer deserves his wages; do not go from house to house. ","Whenever you enter a town and they receive you
 eat what is set before you; ","heal the sick in it and say to them
 \u2018The kingdom of God has come near to you.\u2019 ","But whenever you enter a town and they do not receive you
 go into its streets and say
 ","\u2018Even the dust of your town that clings to our feet
 we wipe off against you; nevertheless know this
 that the kingdom of God has come near.\u2019 ","I tell you
 it shall be more tolerable on that day for Sodom than for that town.","\u201cWoe to you
 Chora\u2032zin! woe to you
 Beth-sa\u2032ida! for if the mighty works done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon
 they would have repented long ago
 sitting in sackcloth and ashes. ","But it shall be more tolerable in the judgment for Tyre and Sidon than for you.","And you
 Caper\u2032na-um
 will you be exalted to heaven? You shall be brought down to Hades.","\u201cHe who hears you hears me
 and he who rejects you rejects me
 and he who rejects me rejects him who sent me.\u201d","And he said to them
 \u201cI saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven. ","Behold
 I have given you authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions
 and over all the power of the enemy; and nothing shall hurt you. ","Nevertheless do not rejoice in this
 that the spirits are subject to you; but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.\u201d","In that same hour he rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said
 \u201cI thank thee
 Father
 Lord of heaven and earth
 that thou hast hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to babes; yea
 Father
 for such was thy gracious will. ","All things have been delivered to me by my Father; and no one knows who the Son is except the Father
 or who the Father is except the Son and any one to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.\u201d","Then turning to the disciples he said privately
 \u201cBlessed are the eyes which see what you see! ","For I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see what you see
 and did not see it
 and to hear what you hear
 and did not hear it.\u201d","And behold
 a lawyer stood up to put him to the test
 saying
 \u201cTeacher
 what shall I do to inherit eternal life?\u201d ","He said to him
 \u201cWhat is written in the law? How do you read?\u201d ","And he said to him
 \u201cYou have answered right; do this
 and you will live.\u201d","Jesus replied
 \u201cA man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho
 and he fell among robbers
 who stripped him and beat him
 and departed
 leaving him half dead. ","Now by chance a priest was going down that road; and when he saw him he passed by on the other side.","So likewise a Levite
 when he came to the place and saw him
 passed by on the other side. ","But a Samaritan
 as he journeyed
 came to where he was; and when he saw him
 he had compassion
 ","and went to him and bound up his wounds
 pouring on oil and wine; then he set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn
 and took care of him. ","And the next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper
 saying
 \u2018Take care of him; and whatever more you spend
 I will repay you when I come back.\u2019 ","Which of these three
 do you think
 proved neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers?\u201d ","He said
 \u201cThe one who showed mercy on him.\u201d And Jesus said to him
 \u201cGo and do likewise.\u201d","But the Lord answered her
 \u201cMartha
 Martha
 you are anxious and troubled about many things; ","one thing is needful. Mary has chosen the good portion
 which shall not be taken away from her.\u201d","He was praying in a certain place
 and when he ceased
 one of his disciples said to him
 \u201cLord
 teach us to pray
 as John taught his disciples.\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cWhen you pray
 say: \u201cFather
 hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. ","Give us each day our daily bread;","and forgive us our sins
 for we ourselves forgive every one who is indebted to us; and lead us not into temptation.\u201d","And he said to them
 \u201cWhich of you who has a friend will go to him at midnight and say to him
 \u2018Friend
 lend me three loaves; ","for a friend of mine has arrived on a journey
 and I have nothing to set before him\u2019; ","and he will answer from within
 \u2018Do not bother me; the door is now shut
 and my children are with me in bed; I cannot get up and give you anything\u2019? ","I tell you
 though he will not get up and give him anything because he is his friend
 yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him whatever he needs. ","And I tell you
 Ask
 and it will be given you; seek
 and you will find; knock
 and it will be opened to you. ","For every one who asks receives
 and he who seeks finds
 and to him who knocks it will be opened. ","What father among you
 if his son asks for a fish
 will instead of a fish give him a serpent; ","or if he asks for an egg
 will give him a scorpion? ","If you then
 who are evil
 know how to give good gifts to your children
 how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!\u201d","Now he was casting out a demon that was dumb; when the demon had gone out
 the dumb man spoke
 and the people marveled. ","But he
 knowing their thoughts
 said to them
 \u201cEvery kingdom divided against itself is laid waste
 and a divided household falls. ","And if Satan also is divided against himself
 how will his kingdom stand? For you say that I cast out demons by Be-el\u2032zebul. ","And if I cast out demons by Be-el\u2032zebul
 by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges. ","But if it is by the finger of God that I cast out demons
 then the kingdom of God has come upon you. ","When a strong man
 fully armed
 guards his own palace
 his goods are in peace; ","but when one stronger than he assails him and overcomes him
 he takes away his armor in which he trusted
 and divides his spoil. ","He who is not with me is against me
 and he who does not gather with me scatters.","\u201cWhen the unclean spirit has gone out of a man
 he passes through waterless places seeking rest; and finding none he says
 \u2018I will return to my house from which I came.\u2019 ","And when he comes he finds it swept and put in order.","Then he goes and brings seven other spirits more evil than himself
 and they enter and dwell there; and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first.\u201d","As he said this
 a woman in the crowd raised her voice and said to him
 \u201cBlessed is the womb that bore you
 and the breasts that you sucked!\u201d ","But he said
 \u201cBlessed rather are those who hear the word of God and keep it!\u201d","When the crowds were increasing
 he began to say
 \u201cThis generation is an evil generation; it seeks a sign
 but no sign shall be given to it except the sign of Jonah. ","For as Jonah became a sign to the men of Nin\u2032eveh
 so will the Son of man be to this generation. ","The queen of the South will arise at the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon
 and behold
 something greater than Solomon is here. ","The men of Nin\u2032eveh will arise at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah
 and behold
 something greater than Jonah is here.","\u201cNo one after lighting a lamp puts it in a cellar or under a bushel
 but on a stand
 that those who enter may see the light. ","Your eye is the lamp of your body; when your eye is sound
 your whole body is full of light; but when it is not sound
 your body is full of darkness. ","Therefore be careful lest the light in you be darkness.","If then your whole body is full of light
 having no part dark
 it will be wholly bright
 as when a lamp with its rays gives you light.\u201d","And the Lord said to him
 \u201cNow you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish
 but inside you are full of extortion and wickedness. ","You fools! Did not he who made the outside make the inside also?","But give for alms those things which are within; and behold
 everything is clean for you.","\u201cBut woe to you Pharisees! for you tithe mint and rue and every herb
 and neglect justice and the love of God; these you ought to have done
 without neglecting the others. ","Woe to you Pharisees! for you love the best seat in the synagogues and salutations in the market places.","Woe to you! for you are like graves which are not seen
 and men walk over them without knowing it.\u201d","And he said
 \u201cWoe to you lawyers also! for you load men with burdens hard to bear
 and you yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers. ","Woe to you! for you build the tombs of the prophets whom your fathers killed.","So you are witnesses and consent to the deeds of your fathers; for they killed them
 and you build their tombs. ","Therefore also the Wisdom of God said
 \u2018I will send them prophets and apostles
 some of whom they will kill and persecute
\u2019 ","that the blood of all the prophets
 shed from the foundation of the world
 may be required of this generation
 ","from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechari\u2032ah
 who perished between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes
 I tell you
 it shall be required of this generation. ","Woe to you lawyers! for you have taken away the key of knowledge; you did not enter yourselves
 and you hindered those who were entering.\u201d","In the meantime
 when so many thousands of the multitude had gathered together that they trod upon one another
 he began to say to his disciples first
 \u201cBeware of the leaven of the Pharisees
 which is hypocrisy. ","Nothing is covered up that will not be revealed
 or hidden that will not be known. ","Therefore whatever you have said in the dark shall be heard in the light
 and what you have whispered in private rooms shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.","\u201cI tell you
 my friends
 do not fear those who kill the body
 and after that have no more that they can do. ","But I will warn you whom to fear: fear him who
 after he has killed
 has power to cast into hell; yes
 I tell you
 fear him! ","Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? And not one of them is forgotten before God.","Why
 even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not; you are of more value than many sparrows.","\u201cAnd I tell you
 every one who acknowledges me before men
 the Son of man also will acknowledge before the angels of God; ","but he who denies me before men will be denied before the angels of God.","And every one who speaks a word against the Son of man will be forgiven; but he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.","And when they bring you before the synagogues and the rulers and the authorities
 do not be anxious how or what you are to answer or what you are to say; ","for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour what you ought to say.\u201d","But he said to him
 \u201cMan
 who made me a judge or divider over you?\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cTake heed
 and beware of all covetousness; for a man\u2019s life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions.\u201d ","And he told them a parable
 saying
 \u201cThe land of a rich man brought forth plentifully; ","and he thought to himself
 \u2018What shall I do
 for I have nowhere to store my crops?\u2019 ","And he said
 \u2018I will do this: I will pull down my barns
 and build larger ones; and there I will store all my grain and my goods. ","And I will say to my soul
 Soul
 you have ample goods laid up for many years; take your ease
 eat
 drink
 be merry.\u2019 ","But God said to him
 \u2018Fool! This night your soul is required of you; and the things you have prepared
 whose will they be?\u2019 ","So is he who lays up treasure for himself
 and is not rich toward God.\u201d","And he said to his disciples
 \u201cTherefore I tell you
 do not be anxious about your life
 what you shall eat
 nor about your body
 what you shall put on. ","For life is more than food
 and the body more than clothing. ","Consider the ravens: they neither sow nor reap
 they have neither storehouse nor barn
 and yet God feeds them. Of how much more value are you than the birds! ","And which of you by being anxious can add a cubit to his span of life?","If then you are not able to do as small a thing as that
 why are you anxious about the rest? ","Consider the lilies
 how they grow; they neither toil nor spin; yet I tell you
 even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. ","But if God so clothes the grass which is alive in the field today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven
 how much more will he clothe you
 O men of little faith! ","And do not seek what you are to eat and what you are to drink
 nor be of anxious mind. ","For all the nations of the world seek these things; and your Father knows that you need them.","Instead
 seek his kingdom
 and these things shall be yours as well.","\u201cFear not
 little flock
 for it is your Father\u2019s good pleasure to give you the kingdom. ","Sell your possessions
 and give alms; provide yourselves with purses that do not grow old
 with a treasure in the heavens that does not fail
 where no thief approaches and no moth destroys. ","For where your treasure is
 there will your heart be also.","\u201cLet your loins be girded and your lamps burning
 ","and be like men who are waiting for their master to come home from the marriage feast
 so that they may open to him at once when he comes and knocks. ","Blessed are those servants whom the master finds awake when he comes; truly
 I say to you
 he will gird himself and have them sit at table
 and he will come and serve them. ","If he comes in the second watch
 or in the third
 and finds them so
 blessed are those servants! ","But know this
 that if the householder had known at what hour the thief was coming
 he would not have left his house to be broken into. ","You also must be ready; for the Son of man is coming at an unexpected hour.\u201d","And the Lord said
 \u201cWho then is the faithful and wise steward
 whom his master will set over his household
 to give them their portion of food at the proper time? ","Blessed is that servant whom his master when he comes will find so doing.","Truly
 I say to you
 he will set him over all his possessions. ","But if that servant says to himself
 \u2018My master is delayed in coming
\u2019 and begins to beat the menservants and the maidservants
 and to eat and drink and get drunk
 ","the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know
 and will punish him
 and put him with the unfaithful. ","And that servant who knew his master\u2019s will
 but did not make ready or act according to his will
 shall receive a severe beating. ","But he who did not know
 and did what deserved a beating
 shall receive a light beating. Every one to whom much is given
 of him will much be required; and of him to whom men commit much they will demand the more.","\u201cI came to cast fire upon the earth; and would that it were already kindled!","I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how I am constrained until it is accomplished!","Do you think that I have come to give peace on earth? No
 I tell you
 but rather division; ","for henceforth in one house there will be five divided
 three against two and two against three; ","they will be divided
 father against son and son against father
 mother against daughter and daughter against her mother
 mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.\u201d","He also said to the multitudes
 \u201cWhen you see a cloud rising in the west
 you say at once
 \u2018A shower is coming\u2019; and so it happens. ","And when you see the south wind blowing
 you say
 \u2018There will be scorching heat\u2019; and it happens. ","You hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of earth and sky; but why do you not know how to interpret the present time?","\u201cAnd why do you not judge for yourselves what is right?","As you go with your accuser before the magistrate
 make an effort to settle with him on the way
 lest he drag you to the judge

 you will never get out till you have paid the very last copper.\u201d","And he answered them
 \u201cDo you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans
 because they suffered thus? ","I tell you
 No; but unless you repent you will all likewise perish. ","Or those eighteen upon whom the tower in Silo\u2032am fell and killed them
 do you think that they were worse offenders than all the others who dwelt in Jerusalem? ","I tell you
 No; but unless you repent you will all likewise perish.\u201d","And he told this parable: \u201cA man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came seeking fruit on it and found none.","And he said to the vinedresser
 \u2018Lo
 these three years I have come seeking fruit on this fig tree
 and I find none. Cut it down; why should it use up the ground?\u2019 ","And he answered him
 \u2018Let it alone
 sir
 this year also

 well and good; but if not
 you can cut it down.\u2019\u201d","And when Jesus saw her
 he called her and said to her
 \u201cWoman

 a daughter of Abraham whom Satan bound for eighteen years
 be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day?\u201d ","He said therefore
 \u201cWhat is the kingdom of God like? And to what shall I compare it? ","It is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his garden; and it grew and became a tree

 \u201cTo what shall I compare the kingdom of God? ","It is like leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour
 till it was all leavened.\u201d","And some one said to him

 go and sit in the lowest place

 he said to him
 \u201cBlessed is he who shall eat bread in the kingdom of God!\u201d ","But he said to him
 \u201cA man once gave a great banquet
 and invited many; ","and at the time for the banquet he sent his servant to say to those who had been invited
 \u2018Come; for all is now ready.\u2019 ","But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said to him
 \u2018I have bought a field

 have me excused.\u2019 ","And another said
 \u2018I have bought five yoke of oxen

 have me excused.\u2019 ","And another said
 \u2018I have married a wife

 \u2018Go out quickly to the streets and lanes of the city

 \u2018Sir
 what you commanded has been done

 \u2018Go out to the highways and hedges

 none of those men who were invited shall taste my banquet.\u2019\u201d","Now great multitudes accompanied him; and he turned and said to them
 ","\u201cIf any one comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters

 for I have found my sheep which was lost.\u2019 ","Just so
 I tell you
 there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance.","\u201cOr what woman
 having ten silver coins
 if she loses one coin
 does not light a lamp and sweep the house and seek diligently until she finds it? ","And when she has found it
 she calls together her friends and neighbors
 saying
 \u2018Rejoice with me
 for I have found the coin which I had lost.\u2019 ","Just so
 I tell you
 there is joy before the angels of God over one sinner who repents.\u201d","And he said
 \u201cThere was a man who had two sons; ","and the younger of them said to his father
 \u2018Father
 give me the share of property that falls to me.\u2019 And he divided his living between them. ","Not many days later
 the younger son gathered all he had and took his journey into a far country
 and there he squandered his property in loose living. ","And when he had spent everything
 a great famine arose in that country
 and he began to be in want. ","So he went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country
 who sent him into his fields to feed swine. ","And he would gladly have fed on the pods that the swine ate; and no one gave him anything.","But when he came to himself he said
 \u2018How many of my father\u2019s hired servants have bread enough and to spare
 but I perish here with hunger! ","I will arise and go to my father
 and I will say to him
 \u201cFather
 I have sinned against heaven and before you; ","I am no longer worthy to be called your son; treat me as one of your hired servants.\u201d\u2019","And he arose and came to his father. But while he was yet at a distance
 his father saw him and had compassion
 and ran and embraced him and kissed him. ","And the son said to him
 \u2018Father
 I have sinned against heaven and before you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son.\u2019 ","But the father said to his servants
 \u2018Bring quickly the best robe
 and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand
 and shoes on his feet; ","and bring the fatted calf and kill it
 and let us eat and make merry; ","for this my son was dead
 and is alive again; he was lost
 and is found.\u2019 And they began to make merry.","\u201cNow his elder son was in the field; and as he came and drew near to the house
 he heard music and dancing. ","And he called one of the servants and asked what this meant.","And he said to him
 \u2018Your brother has come
 and your father has killed the fatted calf
 because he has received him safe and sound.\u2019 ","But he was angry and refused to go in. His father came out and entreated him
 ","but he answered his father
 \u2018Lo
 these many years I have served you
 and I never disobeyed your command; yet you never gave me a kid
 that I might make merry with my friends. ","But when this son of yours came
 who has devoured your living with harlots
 you killed for him the fatted calf!\u2019 ","And he said to him
 \u2018Son
 you are always with me
 and all that is mine is yours. ","It was fitting to make merry and be glad
 for this your brother was dead
 and is alive; he was lost
 and is found.\u2019\u201d","He also said to the disciples
 \u201cThere was a rich man who had a steward
 and charges were brought to him that this man was wasting his goods. ","And he called him and said to him
 \u2018What is this that I hear about you? Turn in the account of your stewardship
 for you can no longer be steward.\u2019 ","And the steward said to himself
 \u2018What shall I do
 since my master is taking the stewardship away from me? I am not strong enough to dig
 and I am ashamed to beg. ","I have decided what to do
 so that people may receive me into their houses when I am put out of the stewardship.\u2019 ","So
 summoning his master\u2019s debtors one by one
 he said to the first
 \u2018How much do you owe my master?\u2019 ","He said
 \u2018A hundred measures of oil.\u2019 And he said to him
 \u2018Take your bill
 and sit down quickly and write fifty.\u2019 ","Then he said to another
 \u2018And how much do you owe?\u2019 He said
 \u2018A hundred measures of wheat.\u2019 He said to him
 \u2018Take your bill
 and write eighty.\u2019 ","The master commended the dishonest steward for his shrewdness; for the sons of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own generation than the sons of light.","And I tell you
 make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous mammon
 so that when it fails they may receive you into the eternal habitations.","\u201cHe who is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much; and he who is dishonest in a very little is dishonest also in much.","If then you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon
 who will entrust to you the true riches? ","And if you have not been faithful in that which is another\u2019s
 who will give you that which is your own? ","No servant can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other
 or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.\u201d","But he said to them
 \u201cYou are those who justify yourselves before men
 but God knows your hearts; for what is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God.","\u201cThe law and the prophets were until John; since then the good news of the kingdom of God is preached
 and every one enters it violently. ","But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away
 than for one dot of the law to become void.","\u201cEvery one who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery
 and he who marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery.","\u201cThere was a rich man
 who was clothed in purple and fine linen and who feasted sumptuously every day. ","And at his gate lay a poor man named Laz\u2032arus
 full of sores
 ","who desired to be fed with what fell from the rich man\u2019s table; moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.","The poor man died and was carried by the angels to Abraham\u2019s bosom. The rich man also died and was buried;","and in Hades
 being in torment
 he lifted up his eyes
 and saw Abraham far off and Laz\u2032arus in his bosom. ","And he called out
 \u2018Father Abraham
 have mercy upon me
 and send Laz\u2032arus to dip the end of his finger in water and cool my tongue; for I am in anguish in this flame.\u2019 ","But Abraham said
 \u2018Son
 remember that you in your lifetime received your good things
 and Laz\u2032arus in like manner evil things; but now he is comforted here
 and you are in anguish. ","And besides all this
 between us and you a great chasm has been fixed
 in order that those who would pass from here to you may not be able
 and none may cross from there to us.\u2019 ","And he said
 \u2018Then I beg you
 father
 to send him to my father\u2019s house
 ","for I have five brothers
 so that he may warn them
 lest they also come into this place of torment.\u2019 ","But Abraham said
 \u2018They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.\u2019 ","And he said
 \u2018No
 father Abraham; but if some one goes to them from the dead
 they will repent.\u2019 ","He said to him
 \u2018If they do not hear Moses and the prophets
 neither will they be convinced if some one should rise from the dead.\u2019\u201d","And he said to his disciples
 \u201cTemptations to sin are sure to come; but woe to him by whom they come! ","It would be better for him if a millstone were hung round his neck and he were cast into the sea
 than that he should cause one of these little ones to sin. ","Take heed to yourselves; if your brother sins
 rebuke him
 and if he repents
 forgive him; ","and if he sins against you seven times in the day
 and turns to you seven times
 and says
 \u2018I repent
\u2019 you must forgive him.\u201d","And the Lord said
 \u201cIf you had faith as a grain of mustard seed
 you could say to this sycamine tree
 \u2018Be rooted up
 and be planted in the sea
\u2019 and it would obey you.","\u201cWill any one of you
 who has a servant plowing or keeping sheep
 say to him when he has come in from the field
 \u2018Come at once and sit down at table\u2019? ","Will he not rather say to him
 \u2018Prepare supper for me
 and gird yourself and serve me
 till I eat and drink; and afterward you shall eat and drink\u2019? ","Does he thank the servant because he did what was commanded?","So you also
 when you have done all that is commanded you
 say
 \u2018We are unworthy servants; we have only done what was our duty.\u2019\u201d","On the way to Jerusalem he was passing along between Samar\u2032ia and Galilee.","When he saw them he said to them
 \u201cGo and show yourselves to the priests.\u201d And as they went they were cleansed. ","Then said Jesus
 \u201cWere not ten cleansed? Where are the nine? ","Was no one found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?\u201d","And he said to him
 \u201cRise and go your way; your faith has made you well.\u201d","Being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God was coming
 he answered them
 \u201cThe kingdom of God is not coming with signs to be observed; ","nor will they say
 \u2018Lo
 here it is!\u2019 or \u2018There!\u2019 for behold
 the kingdom of God is in the midst of you.\u201d","And he said to the disciples
 \u201cThe days are coming when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of man
 and you will not see it. ","And they will say to you
 \u2018Lo
 there!\u2019 or \u2018Lo
 here!\u2019 Do not go
 do not follow them. ","For as the lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one side to the other
 so will the Son of man be in his day. ","But first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.","As it was in the days of Noah
 so will it be in the days of the Son of man. ","They ate
 they drank
 they married
 they were given in marriage
 until the day when Noah entered the ark
 and the flood came and destroyed them all. ","Likewise as it was in the days of Lot\u2014they ate
 they drank
 they bought
 they sold
 they planted
 they built
 ","but on the day when Lot went out from Sodom fire and sulphur rained from heaven and destroyed them all\u2014","so will it be on the day when the Son of man is revealed.","On that day
 let him who is on the housetop
 with his goods in the house
 not come down to take them away; and likewise let him who is in the field not turn back. ","Remember Lot\u2019s wife.","Whoever seeks to gain his life will lose it
 but whoever loses his life will preserve it. ","I tell you
 in that night there will be two in one bed; one will be taken and the other left. ","There will be two women grinding together; one will be taken and the other left.\u201d","And they said to him
 \u201cWhere
 Lord?\u201d He said to them
 \u201cWhere the body is
 there the eagles will be gathered together.\u201d","He said
 \u201cIn a certain city there was a judge who neither feared God nor regarded man; ","and there was a widow in that city who kept coming to him and saying
 \u2018Vindicate me against my adversary.\u2019 ","For a while he refused; but afterward he said to himself
 \u2018Though I neither fear God nor regard man
 ","yet because this widow bothers me
 I will vindicate her
 or she will wear me out by her continual coming.\u2019\u201d ","And the Lord said
 \u201cHear what the unrighteous judge says. ","And will not God vindicate his elect
 who cry to him day and night? Will he delay long over them? ","I tell you
 he will vindicate them speedily. Nevertheless
 when the Son of man comes
 will he find faith on earth?\u201d","\u201cTwo men went up into the temple to pray
 one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. ","The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself
 \u2018God
 I thank thee that I am not like other men
 extortioners
 unjust
 adulterers
 or even like this tax collector. ","I fast twice a week
 I give tithes of all that I get.\u2019 ","But the tax collector
 standing far off
 would not even lift up his eyes to heaven
 but beat his breast
 saying
 \u2018God
 be merciful to me a sinner!\u2019 ","I tell you
 this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for every one who exalts himself will be humbled
 but he who humbles himself will be exalted.\u201d","But Jesus called them to him
 saying
 \u201cLet the children come to me
 and do not hinder them; for to such belongs the kingdom of God. ","Truly
 I say to you
 whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it.\u201d","And Jesus said to him
 \u201cWhy do you call me good? No one is good but God alone. ","You know the commandments: \u2018Do not commit adultery
 Do not kill
 Do not steal
 Do not bear false witness
 Honor your father and mother.\u2019\u201d ","And he said
 \u201cAll these I have observed from my youth.\u201d ","And when Jesus heard it
 he said to him
 \u201cOne thing you still lack. Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor
 and you will have treasure in heaven; and come
 follow me.\u201d ","Jesus looking at him said
 \u201cHow hard it is for those who have riches to enter the kingdom of God! ","For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.\u201d","But he said
 \u201cWhat is impossible with men is possible with God.\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cTruly
 I say to you
 there is no man who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children
 for the sake of the kingdom of God
 ","who will not receive manifold more in this time
 and in the age to come eternal life.\u201d","And taking the twelve
 he said to them
 \u201cBehold
 we are going up to Jerusalem
 and everything that is written of the Son of man by the prophets will be accomplished. ","For he will be delivered to the Gentiles
 and will be mocked and shamefully treated and spit upon; ","they will scourge him and kill him
 and on the third day he will rise.\u201d ","But they understood none of these things; this saying was hid from them
 and they did not grasp what was said.","\u201cWhat do you want me to do for you?\u201d He said
 \u201cLord
 let me receive my sight.\u201d ","And Jesus said to him
 \u201cReceive your sight; your faith has made you well.\u201d ","And when Jesus came to the place
 he looked up and said to him
 \u201cZacchae\u2032us
 make haste and come down; for I must stay at your house today.\u201d ","And Zacchae\u2032us stood and said to the Lord
 \u201cBehold
 Lord
 the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have defrauded any one of anything
 I restore it fourfold.\u201d ","And Jesus said to him
 \u201cToday salvation has come to this house
 since he also is a son of Abraham. ","For the Son of man came to seek and to save the lost.\u201d","He said therefore
 \u201cA nobleman went into a far country to receive a kingdom and then return. ","Calling ten of his servants
 he gave them ten pounds
 and said to them
 \u2018Trade with these till I come.\u2019 ","But his citizens hated him and sent an embassy after him
 saying
 \u2018We do not want this man to reign over us.\u2019 ","When he returned
 having received the kingdom
 he commanded these servants
 to whom he had given the money
 to be called to him
 that he might know what they had gained by trading. ","The first came before him
 saying
 \u2018Lord
 your pound has made ten pounds more.\u2019 ","And he said to him
 \u2018Well done
 good servant! Because you have been faithful in a very little
 you shall have authority over ten cities.\u2019 ","And the second came
 saying
 \u2018Lord
 your pound has made five pounds.\u2019 ","And he said to him
 \u2018And you are to be over five cities.\u2019 ","Then another came
 saying
 \u2018Lord
 here is your pound
 which I kept laid away in a napkin; ","for I was afraid of you
 because you are a severe man; you take up what you did not lay down
 and reap what you did not sow.\u2019 ","He said to him
 \u2018I will condemn you out of your own mouth
 you wicked servant! You knew that I was a severe man
 taking up what I did not lay down and reaping what I did not sow? ","Why then did you not put my money into the bank
 and at my coming I should have collected it with interest?\u2019 ","And he said to those who stood by
 \u2018Take the pound from him
 and give it to him who has the ten pounds.\u2019 ","(And they said to him
 \u2018Lord
 he has ten pounds!\u2019) ","\u2018I tell you
 that to every one who has will more be given; but from him who has not
 even what he has will be taken away. ","But as for these enemies of mine
 who did not want me to reign over them
 bring them here and slay them before me.\u2019\u201d","saying
 \u201cGo into the village opposite
 where on entering you will find a colt tied
 on which no one has ever yet sat; untie it and bring it here. ","If any one asks you
 \u2018Why are you untying it?\u2019 you shall say this
 \u2018The Lord has need of it.\u2019\u201d ","And some of the Pharisees in the multitude said to him
 \u201cTeacher
 rebuke your disciples.\u201d ","He answered
 \u201cI tell you
 if these were silent
 the very stones would cry out.\u201d","saying
 \u201cWould that even today you knew the things that make for peace! But now they are hid from your eyes. ","For the days shall come upon you
 when your enemies will cast up a bank about you and surround you
 and hem you in on every side
 ","and dash you to the ground
 you and your children within you
 and they will not leave one stone upon another in you; because you did not know the time of your visitation.\u201d","saying to them
 \u201cIt is written
 \u2018My house shall be a house of prayer\u2019; but you have made it a den of robbers.\u201d","He answered them
 \u201cI also will ask you a question; now tell me
 ","Was the baptism of John from heaven or from men?\u201d","And Jesus said to them
 \u201cNeither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.\u201d","And he began to tell the people this parable: \u201cA man planted a vineyard
 and let it out to tenants
 and went into another country for a long while. ","When the time came
 he sent a servant to the tenants
 that they should give him some of the fruit of the vineyard; but the tenants beat him
 and sent him away empty-handed. ","And he sent another servant; him also they beat and treated shamefully
 and sent him away empty-handed. ","And he sent yet a third; this one they wounded and cast out.","Then the owner of the vineyard said
 \u2018What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; it may be they will respect him.\u2019 ","But when the tenants saw him
 they said to themselves
 \u2018This is the heir; let us kill him
 that the inheritance may be ours.\u2019 ","And they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?","He will come and destroy those tenants
 and give the vineyard to others.\u201d When they heard this
 they said
 \u201cGod forbid!\u201d ","But he looked at them and said
 \u201cWhat then is this that is written: \u2018The very stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner\u2019?","Every one who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces; but when it falls on any one it will crush him.\u201d","So they watched him
 and sent spies
 who pretended to be sincere
 that they might take hold of what he said
 so as to deliver him up to the authority and jurisdiction of the governor. ","\u201cShow me a coin. Whose likeness and inscription has it?\u201d They said
 \u201cCaesar\u2019s.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cThen render to Caesar the things that are Caesar\u2019s
 and to God the things that are God\u2019s.\u201d ","And they were not able in the presence of the people to catch him by what he said; but marveling at his answer they were silent.","And Jesus said to them
 \u201cThe sons of this age marry and are given in marriage; ","but those who are accounted worthy to attain to that age and to the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage
 ","for they cannot die any more
 because they are equal to angels and are sons of God
 being sons of the resurrection. ","But that the dead are raised
 even Moses showed
 in the passage about the bush
 where he calls the Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob. ","Now he is not God of the dead
 but of the living; for all live to him.\u201d ","But he said to them
 \u201cHow can they say that the Christ is David\u2019s son? ","For David himself says in the Book of Psalms
 \u2018The Lord said to my Lord
 Sit at my right hand
","till I make thy enemies a stool for thy feet.\u2019","David thus calls him Lord; so how is he his son?\u201d","\u201cBeware of the scribes
 who like to go about in long robes
 and love salutations in the market places and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at feasts
 ","who devour widows\u2019 houses and for a pretense make long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation.\u201d","And he said
 \u201cTruly I tell you
 this poor widow has put in more than all of them; ","for they all contributed out of their abundance
 but she out of her poverty put in all the living that she had.\u201d","\u201cAs for these things which you see
 the days will come when there shall not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down.\u201d ","And he said
 \u201cTake heed that you are not led astray; for many will come in my name
 saying
 \u2018I am he!\u2019 and
 \u2018The time is at hand!\u2019 Do not go after them. ","And when you hear of wars and tumults
 do not be terrified; for this must first take place
 but the end will not be at once.\u201d","Then he said to them
 \u201cNation will rise against nation
 and kingdom against kingdom; ","there will be great earthquakes
 and in various places famines and pestilences; and there will be terrors and great signs from heaven. ","But before all this they will lay their hands on you and persecute you
 delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons
 and you will be brought before kings and governors for my name\u2019s sake. ","This will be a time for you to bear testimony.","Settle it therefore in your minds
 not to meditate beforehand how to answer; ","for I will give you a mouth and wisdom
 which none of your adversaries will be able to withstand or contradict. ","You will be delivered up even by parents and brothers and kinsmen and friends

 then know that its desolation has come near. ","Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains
 and let those who are inside the city depart
 and let not those who are out in the country enter it; ","for these are days of vengeance
 to fulfil all that is written. ","Alas for those who are with child and for those who give suck in those days! For great distress shall be upon the earth and wrath upon this people;","they will fall by the edge of the sword
 and be led captive among all nations; and Jerusalem will be trodden down by the Gentiles
 until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.","\u201cAnd there will be signs in sun and moon and stars
 and upon the earth distress of nations in perplexity at the roaring of the sea and the waves
 ","men fainting with fear and with foreboding of what is coming on the world; for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.","And then they will see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.","Now when these things begin to take place
 look up and raise your heads
 because your redemption is drawing near.\u201d","And he told them a parable: \u201cLook at the fig tree
 and all the trees; ","as soon as they come out in leaf
 you see for yourselves and know that the summer is already near. ","So also
 when you see these things taking place
 you know that the kingdom of God is near. ","Truly
 I say to you
 this generation will not pass away till all has taken place. ","Heaven and earth will pass away

 \u201cWhy do you sleep? Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation.\u201d","but Jesus said to him
 \u201cJudas
 would you betray the Son of man with a kiss?\u201d ","But Jesus said
 \u201cNo more of this!\u201d And he touched his ear and healed him. ","Then Jesus said to the chief priests and officers of the temple and elders
 who had come out against him
 \u201cHave you come out as against a robber
 with swords and clubs? ","When I was with you day after day in the temple
 you did not lay hands on me. But this is your hour
 and the power of darkness.\u201d","And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord
 how he had said to him
 \u201cBefore the cock crows today
 you will deny me three times.\u201d ","\u201cIf you are the Christ
 tell us.\u201d But he said to them
 \u201cIf I tell you
 you will not believe; ","and if I ask you
 you will not answer. ","But from now on the Son of man shall be seated at the right hand of the power of God.\u201d","And they all said
 \u201cAre you the Son of God
 then?\u201d And he said to them
 \u201cYou say that I am.\u201d ","And Pilate asked him
 \u201cAre you the King of the Jews?\u201d And he answered him
 \u201cYou have said so.\u201d ","When Pilate heard this
 he asked whether the man was a Galilean. ","and said to them
 \u201cYou brought me this man as one who was perverting the people; and after examining him before you
 behold
 I did not find this man guilty of any of your charges against him; ","A third time he said to them
 \u201cWhy
 what evil has he done? I have found in him no crime deserving death; I will therefore chastise him and release him.\u201d ","But Jesus turning to them said
 \u201cDaughters of Jerusalem
 do not weep for me
 but weep for yourselves and for your children. ","For behold
 the days are coming when they will say
 \u2018Blessed are the barren
 and the wombs that never bore
 and the breasts that never gave suck!\u2019 ","Then they will begin to say to the mountains
 \u2018Fall on us\u2019; and to the hills
 \u2018Cover us.\u2019 ","For if they do this when the wood is green
 what will happen when it is dry?\u201d","And Jesus said
 \u201cFather
 forgive them; for they know not what they do.\u201d And they cast lots to divide his garments. ","And he said to him
 \u201cTruly
 I say to you
 today you will be with me in Paradise.\u201d","Then Jesus
 crying with a loud voice
 said
 \u201cFather
 into thy hands I commit my spirit!\u201d And having said this he breathed his last. ","and as they were frightened and bowed their faces to the ground
 the men said to them
 \u201cWhy do you seek the living among the dead? ","And he said to them
 \u201cWhat is this conversation which you are holding with each other as you walk?\u201d And they stood still
 looking sad. ","And he said to them
 \u201cWhat things?\u201d And they said to him
 \u201cConcerning Jesus of Nazareth
 who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people
 ","And he said to them
 \u201cO foolish men
 and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! ","Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?\u201d","As they were saying this
 Jesus himself stood among them. ","And he said to them
 \u201cWhy are you troubled
 and why do questionings rise in your hearts? ","See my hands and my feet
 that it is I myself; handle me
 and see; for a spirit has not flesh and bones as you see that I have.\u201d ","And while they still disbelieved for joy
 and wondered
 he said to them
 \u201cHave you anything here to eat?\u201d ","Then he said to them
 \u201cThese are my words which I spoke to you
 while I was still with you
 that everything written about me in the law of Moses and the prophets and the psalms must be fulfilled.\u201d ","and said to them
 \u201cThus it is written
 that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead
 ","and that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be preached in his name to all nations
 beginning from Jerusalem. ","You are witnesses of these things.","And behold
 I send the promise of my Father upon you; but stay in the city
 until you are clothed with power from on high.\u201d","And he said to them
 \u201cHow is it that you sought me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father\u2019s house?\u201d ","And Jesus answered him
 \u201cIt is written
 \u2018Man shall not live by bread alone.\u2019\u201d ","and said to him
 \u201cTo you I will give all this authority and their glory; for it has been delivered to me
 and I give it to whom I will. ","And Jesus answered him
 \u201cIt is written
 \u2018You shall worship the Lord your God
 and him only shall you serve.\u2019\u201d","And he took him to Jerusalem
 and set him on the pinnacle of the temple
 and said to him
 \u201cIf you are the Son of God
 throw yourself down from here; ","And Jesus answered him
 \u201cIt is said
 \u2018You shall not tempt the Lord your God.\u2019\u201d ","\u201cThe Spirit of the Lord is upon me
 because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind
 to set at liberty those who are oppressed
","to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.\u201d","And he began to say to them
 \u201cToday this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cDoubtless you will quote to me this proverb
 \u2018Physician
 heal yourself; what we have heard you did at Caper\u2032na-um
 do here also in your own country.\u2019\u201d ","And he said
 \u201cTruly
 I say to you
 no prophet is acceptable in his own country. ","But in truth
 I tell you
 there were many widows in Israel in the days of Eli\u2032jah
 when the heaven was shut up three years and six months
 when there came a great famine over all the land; ","and Eli\u2032jah was sent to none of them but only to Zar\u2032ephath
 in the land of Sidon
 to a woman who was a widow. ","And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet Eli\u2032sha; and none of them was cleansed
 but only Na\u2032aman the Syrian.\u201d ","and they were astonished at his teaching
 for his word was with authority. ","But Jesus rebuked him
 saying
 \u201cBe silent
 and come out of him!\u201d And when the demon had thrown him down in the midst
 he came out of him
 having done him no harm. ","And demons also came out of many
 crying
 \u201cYou are the Son of God!\u201d But he rebuked them
 and would not allow them to speak
 because they knew that he was the Christ.","but he said to them
 \u201cI must preach the good news of the kingdom of God to the other cities also; for I was sent for this purpose.\u201d ","And when he had ceased speaking
 he said to Simon
 \u201cPut out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.\u201d ","and so also were James and John
 sons of Zeb\u2032edee
 who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon
 \u201cDo not be afraid; henceforth you will be catching men.\u201d ","And he stretched out his hand
 and touched him
 saying
 \u201cI will; be clean.\u201d And immediately the leprosy left him. ","And he charged him to tell no one; but \u201cgo and show yourself to the priest
 and make an offering for your cleansing
 as Moses commanded
 for a proof to the people.\u201d ","And when he saw their faith he said
 \u201cMan
 your sins are forgiven you.\u201d ","When Jesus perceived their questionings
 he answered them
 \u201cWhy do you question in your hearts? ","Which is easier
 to say
 \u2018Your sins are forgiven you
\u2019 or to say
 \u2018Rise and walk\u2019? ","But that you may know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins\u201d\u2014he said to the man who was paralyzed\u2014\u201cI say to you
 rise
 take up your bed and go home.\u201d ","After this he went out
 and saw a tax collector
 named Levi
 sitting at the tax office; and he said to him
 \u201cFollow me.\u201d ","And Jesus answered them
 \u201cThose who are well have no need of a physician
 but those who are sick; ","I have not come to call the righteous
 but sinners to repentance.\u201d","And they said to him
 \u201cThe disciples of John fast often and offer prayers
 and so do the disciples of the Pharisees
 but yours eat and drink.\u201d ","And Jesus said to them
 \u201cCan you make wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them? ","The days will come
 when the bridegroom is taken away from them
 and then they will fast in those days.\u201d ","He told them a parable also: \u201cNo one tears a piece from a new garment and puts it upon an old garment; if he does
 he will tear the new
 and the piece from the new will not match the old. ","And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; if he does
 the new wine will burst the skins and it will be spilled
 and the skins will be destroyed. ","But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins.","And no one after drinking old wine desires new; for he says
 \u2018The old is good.\u2019\u201d","And Jesus answered
 \u201cHave you not read what David did when he was hungry
 he and those who were with him: ","how he entered the house of God
 and took and ate the bread of the Presence
 which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat
 and also gave it to those with him?\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cThe Son of man is lord of the sabbath.\u201d","But he knew their thoughts
 and he said to the man who had the withered hand
 \u201cCome and stand here.\u201d And he rose and stood there. ","And Jesus said to them
 \u201cI ask you
 is it lawful on the sabbath to do good or to do harm
 to save life or to destroy it?\u201d ","And he looked around on them all
 and said to him
 \u201cStretch out your hand.\u201d And he did so
 and his hand was restored. ","\u201cBlessed are you that hunger now
 for you shall be satisfied. \u201cBlessed are you that weep now
 for you shall laugh.","\u201cBlessed are you when men hate you
 and when they exclude you and revile you
 and cast out your name as evil
 on account of the Son of man! ","Rejoice in that day
 and leap for joy
 for behold
 your reward is great in heaven; for so their fathers did to the prophets.","\u201cBut woe to you that are rich
 for you have received your consolation.","\u201cWoe to you that are full now
 for you shall hunger. \u201cWoe to you that laugh now
 for you shall mourn and weep.","\u201cWoe to you
 when all men speak well of you
 for so their fathers did to the false prophets.","\u201cBut I say to you that hear

 do good to those who hate you
 ","bless those who curse you
 pray for those who abuse you. ","To him who strikes you on the cheek
 offer the other also; and from him who takes away your cloak do not withhold your coat as well. ","Give to every one who begs from you; and of him who takes away your goods do not ask them again.","And as you wish that men would do to you
 do so to them.","\u201cIf you love those who love you
 what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them. ","And if you do good to those who do good to you
 what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same. ","And if you lend to those from whom you hope to receive
 what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners
 to receive as much again. ","But love your enemies
 and do good
 and lend
 expecting nothing in return; and your reward will be great
 and you will be sons of the Most High; for he is kind to the ungrateful and the selfish. ","Be merciful
 even as your Father is merciful.","\u201cJudge not
 and you will not be judged; condemn not
 and you will not be condemned; forgive
 and you will be forgiven; ","give
 and it will be given to you; good measure
 pressed down
 shaken together
 running over
 will be put into your lap. For the measure you give will be the measure you get back.\u201d","He also told them a parable: \u201cCan a blind man lead a blind man? Will they not both fall into a pit?","A disciple is not above his teacher
 but every one when he is fully taught will be like his teacher. ","Why do you see the speck that is in your brother\u2019s eye
 but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? ","Or how can you say to your brother
 \u2018Brother
 let me take out the speck that is in your eye
\u2019 when you yourself do not see the log that is in your own eye? You hypocrite
 first take the log out of your own eye
 and then you will see clearly to take out the speck that is in your brother\u2019s eye.","\u201cFor no good tree bears bad fruit
 nor again does a bad tree bear good fruit; ","for each tree is known by its own fruit. For figs are not gathered from thorns
 nor are grapes picked from a bramble bush. ","The good man out of the good treasure of his heart produces good
 and the evil man out of his evil treasure produces evil; for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.","\u201cWhy do you call me \u2018Lord
 Lord
\u2019 and not do what I tell you? ","Every one who comes to me and hears my words and does them
 I will show you what he is like: ","he is like a man building a house
 who dug deep
 and laid the foundation upon rock; and when a flood arose
 the stream broke against that house
 and could not shake it
 because it had been well built. ","But he who hears and does not do them is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation; against which the stream broke
 and immediately it fell
 and the ruin of that house was great.\u201d","When Jesus heard this he marveled at him
 and turned and said to the multitude that followed him
 \u201cI tell you
 not even in Israel have I found such faith.\u201d ","And when the Lord saw her
 he had compassion on her and said to her
 \u201cDo not weep.\u201d ","And he came and touched the bier
 and the bearers stood still. And he said
 \u201cYoung man
 I say to you
 arise.\u201d ","And he answered them
 \u201cGo and tell John what you have seen and heard: the blind receive their sight

 lepers are cleansed
 and the deaf hear

 he began to speak to the crowds concerning John: \u201cWhat did you go out into the wilderness to behold? A reed shaken by the wind? ","What then did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold
 those who are gorgeously appareled and live in luxury are in kings\u2019 courts. ","What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes
 I tell you
 and more than a prophet. ","This is he of whom it is written
 \u2018Behold
 I send my messenger before thy face
 who shall prepare thy way before thee.\u2019","I tell you
 among those born of women none is greater than John; yet he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.\u201d ","\u201cTo what then shall I compare the men of this generation
 and what are they like? ","They are like children sitting in the market place and calling to one another

 \u2018He has a demon.\u2019 ","The Son of man has come eating and drinking; and you say
 \u2018Behold
 a glutton and a drunkard

 he said to himself
 \u201cIf this man were a prophet
 he would have known who and what sort of woman this is who is touching him

 \u201cSimon
 I have something to say to you.\u201d And he answered
 \u201cWhat is it
 Teacher?\u201d ","\u201cA certain creditor had two debtors; one owed five hundred denarii
 and the other fifty. ","When they could not pay
 he forgave them both. Now which of them will love him more?\u201d ","Simon answered
 \u201cThe one
 I suppose
 to whom he forgave more.\u201d And he said to him
 \u201cYou have judged rightly.\u201d ","Then turning toward the woman he said to Simon
 \u201cDo you see this woman? I entered your house
 you gave me no water for my feet
 but she has wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. ","You gave me no kiss
 but from the time I came in she has not ceased to kiss my feet. ","You did not anoint my head with oil
 but she has anointed my feet with ointment. ","Therefore I tell you
 her sins
 which are many
 are forgiven

 loves little.\u201d ","And he said to her
 \u201cYour sins are forgiven.\u201d ","And he said to the woman
 \u201cYour faith has saved you; go in peace.\u201d","And when a great crowd came together and people from town after town came to him
 he said in a parable: ","\u201cA sower went out to sow his seed; and as he sowed
 some fell along the path
 and was trodden under foot
 and the birds of the air devoured it. ","And some fell on the rock; and as it grew up
 it withered away
 because it had no moisture. ","And some fell among thorns; and the thorns grew with it and choked it.","And some fell into good soil and grew
 and yielded a hundredfold.\u201d As he said this
 he called out
 \u201cHe who has ears to hear
 let him hear.\u201d","he said
 \u201cTo you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of God; but for others they are in parables
 so that seeing they may not see
 and hearing they may not understand. ","Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.","The ones along the path are those who have heard; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts
 that they may not believe and be saved. ","And the ones on the rock are those who
 when they hear the word
 receive it with joy; but these have no root
 they believe for a while and in time of temptation fall away. ","And as for what fell among the thorns
 they are those who hear
 but as they go on their way they are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life
 and their fruit does not mature. ","And as for that in the good soil
 they are those who
 hearing the word
 hold it fast in an honest and good heart
 and bring forth fruit with patience.","\u201cNo one after lighting a lamp covers it with a vessel
 or puts it under a bed
 but puts it on a stand
 that those who enter may see the light. ","For nothing is hid that shall not be made manifest
 nor anything secret that shall not be known and come to light. ","Take heed then how you hear; for to him who has will more be given
 and from him who has not
 even what he thinks that he has will be taken away.\u201d","And he was told
 \u201cYour mother and your brethren are standing outside
 desiring to see you.\u201d ","But he said to them
 \u201cMy mother and my brethren are those who hear the word of God and do it.\u201d","One day he got into a boat with his disciples
 and he said to them
 \u201cLet us go across to the other side of the lake.\u201d So they set out
 ","He said to them
 \u201cWhere is your faith?\u201d And they were afraid
 and they marveled
 saying to one another
 \u201cWho then is this
 that he commands even wind and water

 \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d And he said
 \u201cLegion\u201d; for many demons had entered him. ","\u201cReturn to your home
 and declare how much God has done for you.\u201d And he went away
 proclaiming throughout the whole city how much Jesus had done for him.","And Jesus said
 \u201cWho was it that touched me?\u201d When all denied it
 Peter said
 \u201cMaster
 the multitudes surround you and press upon you!\u201d ","But Jesus said
 \u201cSome one touched me; for I perceive that power has gone forth from me.\u201d ","And he said to her
 \u201cDaughter
 your faith has made you well; go in peace.\u201d","But Jesus on hearing this answered him
 \u201cDo not fear; only believe

 \u201cDo not weep; for she is not dead but sleeping.\u201d ","But taking her by the hand he called
 saying
 \u201cChild

 \u201cYou give them something to eat.\u201d They said
 \u201cWe have no more than five loaves and two fish\u2014unless we are to go and buy food for all these people.\u201d ","For there were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples
 \u201cMake them sit down in companies

 \u201cThe Christ of God.\u201d ","saying
 \u201cThe Son of man must suffer many things

 there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God.\u201d","And as the men were parting from him
 Peter said to Jesus
 \u201cMaster

 \u201cThe one who showed mercy on him.\u201d And Jesus said to him
 \u201cGo and do likewise.\u201d","But the Lord answered her
 \u201cMartha
 Martha
 you are anxious and troubled about many things; ","one thing is needful. Mary has chosen the good portion
 which shall not be taken away from her.\u201d","He was praying in a certain place
 and when he ceased
 one of his disciples said to him
 \u201cLord
 teach us to pray
 as John taught his disciples.\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cWhen you pray
 say: \u201cFather
 hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. ","Give us each day our daily bread;","and forgive us our sins
 for we ourselves forgive every one who is indebted to us; and lead us not into temptation.\u201d","And he said to them
 \u201cWhich of you who has a friend will go to him at midnight and say to him
 \u2018Friend
 lend me three loaves; ","for a friend of mine has arrived on a journey
 and I have nothing to set before him\u2019; ","and he will answer from within
 \u2018Do not bother me; the door is now shut
 and my children are with me in bed; I cannot get up and give you anything\u2019? ","I tell you
 though he will not get up and give him anything because he is his friend
 yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him whatever he needs. ","And I tell you
 Ask
 and it will be given you; seek
 and you will find; knock
 and it will be opened to you. ","For every one who asks receives
 and he who seeks finds
 and to him who knocks it will be opened. ","What father among you
 if his son asks for a fish
 will instead of a fish give him a serpent; ","or if he asks for an egg
 will give him a scorpion? ","If you then
 who are evil
 know how to give good gifts to your children
 how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!\u201d","Now he was casting out a demon that was dumb; when the demon had gone out
 the dumb man spoke
 and the people marveled. ","But he
 knowing their thoughts
 said to them
 \u201cEvery kingdom divided against itself is laid waste
 and house falls upon house. ","And if Satan also is divided against himself
 how will his kingdom stand? For you say that I cast out demons by Be-el\u2032zebul. ","And if I cast out demons by Be-el\u2032zebul
 by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges. ","But if it is by the finger of God that I cast out demons
 then the kingdom of God has come upon you. ","When a strong man
 fully armed
 guards his own palace
 his goods are in peace; ","but when one stronger than he assails him and overcomes him
 he takes away his armor in which he trusted
 and divides his spoil. ","He who is not with me is against me
 and he who does not gather with me scatters.","\u201cWhen the unclean spirit has gone out of a man
 he passes through waterless places seeking rest; and finding none he says
 \u2018I will return to my house from which I came.\u2019 ","And when he comes he finds it swept and put in order.","Then he goes and brings seven other spirits more evil than himself
 and they enter and dwell there; and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first.\u201d","As he said this
 a woman in the crowd raised her voice and said to him
 \u201cBlessed is the womb that bore you
 and the breasts that you sucked!\u201d ","But he said
 \u201cBlessed rather are those who hear the word of God and keep it!\u201d","When the crowds were increasing
 he began to say
 \u201cThis generation is an evil generation; it seeks a sign
 but no sign shall be given to it except the sign of Jonah. ","For as Jonah became a sign to the men of Nin\u2032eveh
 so will the Son of man be to this generation. ","The queen of the South will arise at the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon
 and behold
 something greater than Solomon is here. ","The men of Nin\u2032eveh will arise at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah
 and behold
 something greater than Jonah is here.","\u201cNo one after lighting a lamp puts it in a cellar or under a bushel
 but on a stand
 that those who enter may see the light. ","Your eye is the lamp of your body; when your eye is sound
 your whole body is full of light; but when it is not sound
 your body is full of darkness. ","Therefore be careful lest the light in you be darkness.","If then your whole body is full of light
 having no part dark
 it will be wholly bright
 as when a lamp with its rays gives you light.\u201d","And the Lord said to him
 \u201cNow you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish
 but inside you are full of extortion and wickedness. ","You fools! Did not he who made the outside make the inside also?","But give for alms those things which are within; and behold
 everything is clean for you.","\u201cBut woe to you Pharisees! for you tithe mint and rue and every herb
 and neglect justice and the love of God; these you ought to have done
 without neglecting the others. ","Woe to you Pharisees! for you love the best seat in the synagogues and salutations in the market places.","Woe to you! for you are like graves which are not seen
 and men walk over them without knowing it.\u201d","And he said
 \u201cWoe to you lawyers also! for you load men with burdens hard to bear
 and you yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers. ","Woe to you! for you build the tombs of the prophets whom your fathers killed.","So you are witnesses and consent to the deeds of your fathers; for they killed them
 and you build their tombs. ","Therefore also the Wisdom of God said
 \u2018I will send them prophets and apostles
 some of whom they will kill and persecute
\u2019 ","that the blood of all the prophets
 shed from the foundation of the world
 may be required of this generation
 ","from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechari\u2032ah
 who perished between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes
 I tell you
 it shall be required of this generation. ","Woe to you lawyers! for you have taken away the key of knowledge; you did not enter yourselves
 and you hindered those who were entering.\u201d","In the meantime
 when so many thousands of the multitude had gathered together that they trod upon one another
 he began to say to his disciples first
 \u201cBeware of the leaven of the Pharisees
 which is hypocrisy. ","Nothing is covered up that will not be revealed
 or hidden that will not be known. ","Whatever you have said in the dark shall be heard in the light
 and what you have whispered in private rooms shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.","\u201cI tell you
 my friends
 do not fear those who kill the body
 and after that have no more that they can do. ","But I will warn you whom to fear: fear him who
 after he has killed
 has power to cast into hell; yes
 I tell you
 fear him! ","Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? And not one of them is forgotten before God.","Why
 even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not; you are of more value than many sparrows.","\u201cAnd I tell you
 every one who acknowledges me before men
 the Son of man also will acknowledge before the angels of God; ","but he who denies me before men will be denied before the angels of God.","And every one who speaks a word against the Son of man will be forgiven; but he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.","And when they bring you before the synagogues and the rulers and the authorities
 do not be anxious how or what you are to answer or what you are to say; ","for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour what you ought to say.\u201d","But he said to him
 \u201cMan
 who made me a judge or divider over you?\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cTake heed
 and beware of all covetousness; for a man\u2019s life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions.\u201d ","And he told them a parable
 saying
 \u201cThe land of a rich man brought forth plentifully; ","and he thought to himself
 \u2018What shall I do
 for I have nowhere to store my crops?\u2019 ","And he said
 \u2018I will do this: I will pull down my barns
 and build larger ones; and there I will store all my grain and my goods. ","And I will say to my soul
 Soul
 you have ample goods laid up for many years; take your ease
 eat
 drink
 be merry.\u2019 ","But God said to him
 \u2018Fool! This night your soul is required of you; and the things you have prepared
 whose will they be?\u2019 ","So is he who lays up treasure for himself
 and is not rich toward God.\u201d","And he said to his disciples
 \u201cTherefore I tell you
 do not be anxious about your life
 what you shall eat
 nor about your body
 what you shall put on. ","For life is more than food
 and the body more than clothing. ","Consider the ravens: they neither sow nor reap
 they have neither storehouse nor barn
 and yet God feeds them. Of how much more value are you than the birds! ","And which of you by being anxious can add a cubit to his span of life?","If then you are not able to do as small a thing as that
 why are you anxious about the rest? ","Consider the lilies
 how they grow; they neither toil nor spin; yet I tell you
 even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. ","But if God so clothes the grass which is alive in the field today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven
 how much more will he clothe you
 O men of little faith! ","And do not seek what you are to eat and what you are to drink
 nor be of anxious mind. ","For all the nations of the world seek these things; and your Father knows that you need them.","Instead
 seek his kingdom
 and these things shall be yours as well.","\u201cFear not
 little flock
 for it is your Father\u2019s good pleasure to give you the kingdom. ","Sell your possessions
 and give alms; provide yourselves with purses that do not grow old
 with a treasure in the heavens that does not fail
 where no thief approaches and no moth destroys. ","For where your treasure is
 there will your heart be also.","\u201cLet your loins be girded and your lamps burning
 ","and be like men who are waiting for their master to come home from the marriage feast
 so that they may open to him at once when he comes and knocks. ","Blessed are those servants whom the master finds awake when he comes; truly
 I say to you
 he will gird himself and have them sit at table
 and he will come and serve them. ","If he comes in the second watch
 or in the third
 and finds them so
 blessed are those servants! ","But know this
 that if the householder had known at what hour the thief was coming
 he would have been awake and would not have left his house to be broken into. ","You also must be ready; for the Son of man is coming at an hour you do not expect.\u201d","And the Lord said
 \u201cWho then is the faithful and wise steward
 whom his master will set over his household
 to give them their portion of food at the proper time? ","Blessed is that servant whom his master when he comes will find so doing.","Truly
 I tell you
 he will set him over all his possessions. ","But if that servant says to himself
 \u2018My master is delayed in coming
\u2019 and begins to beat the menservants and the maidservants
 and to eat and drink and get drunk
 ","the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know
 and will punish him
 and put him with the unfaithful. ","And that servant who knew his master\u2019s will
 but did not make ready or act according to his will
 shall receive a severe beating. ","But he who did not know
 and did what deserved a beating
 shall receive a light beating. Every one to whom much is given
 of him will much be required; and of him to whom men commit much they will demand the more.","\u201cI came to cast fire upon the earth; and would that it were already kindled!","I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how I am constrained until it is accomplished!","Do you think that I have come to give peace on earth? No
 I tell you
 but rather division; ","for henceforth in one house there will be five divided
 three against two and two against three; ","they will be divided
 father against son and son against father
 mother against daughter and daughter against her mother
 mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.\u201d","He also said to the multitudes
 \u201cWhen you see a cloud rising in the west
 you say at once
 \u2018A shower is coming\u2019; and so it happens. ","And when you see the south wind blowing
 you say
 \u2018There will be scorching heat\u2019; and it happens. ","You hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of earth and sky; but why do you not know how to interpret the present time?","\u201cAnd why do you not judge for yourselves what is right?","As you go with your accuser before the magistrate
 make an effort to settle with him on the way
 lest he drag you to the judge
 and the judge hand you over to the officer
 and the officer put you in prison. ","I tell you
 you will never get out till you have paid the very last copper.\u201d","And he answered them
 \u201cDo you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans
 because they suffered thus? ","I tell you
 No; but unless you repent you will all likewise perish. ","Or those eighteen upon whom the tower in Silo\u2032am fell and killed them
 do you think that they were worse offenders than all the others who dwelt in Jerusalem? ","I tell you
 No; but unless you repent you will all likewise perish.\u201d","And he told this parable: \u201cA man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came seeking fruit on it and found none.","And he said to the vinedresser
 \u2018Lo
 these three years I have come seeking fruit on this fig tree
 and I find none. Cut it down; why should it use up the ground?\u2019 ","And he answered him
 \u2018Let it alone
 sir
 this year also
 till I dig about it and put on manure. ","And if it bears fruit next year
 well and good; but if not
 you can cut it down.\u2019\u201d","And when Jesus saw her
 he called her and said to her
 \u201cWoman
 you are freed from your infirmity.\u201d ","Then the Lord answered him
 \u201cYou hypocrites! Does not each of you on the sabbath untie his ox or his ass from the manger
 and lead it away to water it? ","And ought not this woman
 a daughter of Abraham whom Satan bound for eighteen years
 be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day?\u201d ","He said therefore
 \u201cWhat is the kingdom of God like? And to what shall I compare it? ","It is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his garden; and it grew and became a tree
 and the birds of the air made nests in its branches.\u201d","And again he said
 \u201cTo what shall I compare the kingdom of God? ","It is like leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal
 till it was all leavened.\u201d","And some one said to him
 \u201cLord
 will those who are saved be few?\u201d And he said to them
 ","\u201cStrive to enter by the narrow door; for many
 I tell you
 will seek to enter and will not be able. ","When once the householder has risen up and shut the door
 you will begin to stand outside and to knock at the door
 saying
 \u2018Lord
 open to us.\u2019 He will answer you
 \u2018I do not know where you come from.\u2019 ","Then you will begin to say
 \u2018We ate and drank in your presence
 and you taught in our streets.\u2019 ","But he will say
 \u2018I tell you
 I do not know where you come from; depart from me
 all you workers of iniquity!\u2019 ","There you will weep and gnash your teeth
 when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God and you yourselves thrust out. ","And men will come from east and west
 and from north and south
 and sit at table in the kingdom of God. ","And behold
 some are last who will be first
 and some are first who will be last.\u201d","And he said to them
 \u201cGo and tell that fox
 \u2018Behold
 I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow
 and the third day I finish my course. ","Nevertheless I must go on my way today and tomorrow and the day following; for it cannot be that a prophet should perish away from Jerusalem.\u2019","O Jerusalem
 Jerusalem
 killing the prophets and stoning those who are sent to you! How often would I have gathered your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings

 your house is forsaken. And I tell you
 you will not see me until you say

 saying
 \u201cIs it lawful to heal on the sabbath
 or not?\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cWhich of you
 having an ass or an ox that has fallen into a well
 will not immediately pull him out on a sabbath day?\u201d ","\u201cWhen you are invited by any one to a marriage feast
 do not sit down in a place of honor
 lest a more eminent man than you be invited by him; ","and he who invited you both will come
 and say to you
 \u2018Give place to this man
\u2019 and then you will begin with shame to take the lowest place. ","But when you are invited
 go and sit in the lowest place
 so that when your host comes he may say to you
 \u2018Friend

 and he who humbles himself will be exalted.\u201d","He said also to the man who had invited him
 \u201cWhen you give a dinner or a banquet
 do not invite your friends or your brothers or your kinsmen or rich neighbors

 and you be repaid. ","But when you give a feast
 invite the poor
 the maimed
 the lame
 the blind
 ","and you will be blessed
 because they cannot repay you. You will be repaid at the resurrection of the just.\u201d","When one of those who sat at table with him heard this
 he said to him
 \u201cBlessed is he who shall eat bread in the kingdom of God!\u201d ","But he said to him
 \u201cA man once gave a great banquet
 and invited many; ","and at the time for the banquet he sent his servant to say to those who had been invited
 \u2018Come; for all is now ready.\u2019 ","But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said to him
 \u2018I have bought a field
 and I must go out and see it; I pray you
 have me excused.\u2019 ","And another said
 \u2018I have bought five yoke of oxen
 and I go to examine them; I pray you
 have me excused.\u2019 ","And another said
 \u2018I have married a wife
 and therefore I cannot come.\u2019 ","So the servant came and reported this to his master. Then the householder in anger said to his servant
 \u2018Go out quickly to the streets and lanes of the city
 and bring in the poor and maimed and blind and lame.\u2019 ","And the servant said
 \u2018Sir
 what you commanded has been done
 and still there is room.\u2019 ","And the master said to the servant
 \u2018Go out to the highways and hedges
 and compel people to come in
 that my house may be filled. ","For I tell you
 none of those men who were invited shall taste my banquet.\u2019\u201d","Now great multitudes accompanied him; and he turned and said to them
 ","\u201cIf any one comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters
 yes
 and even his own life
 he cannot be my disciple. ","Whoever does not bear his own cross and come after me
 cannot be my disciple. ","For which of you
 desiring to build a tower
 does not first sit down and count the cost
 whether he has enough to complete it? ","Otherwise
 when he has laid a foundation
 and is not able to finish
 all who see it begin to mock him
 ","saying
 \u2018This man began to build
 and was not able to finish.\u2019 ","Or what king
 going to encounter another king in war
 will not sit down first and take counsel whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand? ","And if not
 while the other is yet a great way off
 he sends an embassy and asks terms of peace. ","So therefore
 whoever of you does not renounce all that he has cannot be my disciple.","\u201cSalt is good; but if salt has lost its taste
 how shall its saltness be restored? ","It is fit neither for the land nor for the dunghill; men throw it away. He who has ears to hear
 let him hear.\u201d","\u201cWhat man of you
 having a hundred sheep
 if he has lost one of them
 does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness
 and go after the one which is lost
 until he finds it? ","And when he has found it
 he lays it on his shoulders
 rejoicing. ","And when he comes home
 he calls together his friends and his neighbors
 saying to them
 \u2018Rejoice with me
 for I have found my sheep which was lost.\u2019 ","Just so
 I tell you
 there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance.","\u201cOr what woman
 having ten silver coins
 if she loses one coin
 does not light a lamp and sweep the house and seek diligently until she finds it? ","And when she has found it
 she calls together her friends and neighbors
 saying
 \u2018Rejoice with me

 I tell you
 there is joy before the angels of God over one sinner who repents.\u201d","And he said
 \u201cThere was a man who had two sons; ","and the younger of them said to his father
 \u2018Father
 give me the share of property that falls to me.\u2019 And he divided his living between them. ","Not many days later
 the younger son gathered all he had and took his journey into a far country
 and there he squandered his property in loose living. ","And when he had spent everything
 a great famine arose in that country
 and he began to be in want. ","So he went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country
 who sent him into his fields to feed swine. ","And he would gladly have fed on the pods that the swine ate; and no one gave him anything.","But when he came to himself he said
 \u2018How many of my father\u2019s hired servants have bread enough and to spare
 but I perish here with hunger! ","I will arise and go to my father
 and I will say to him
 \u201cFather
 I have sinned against heaven and before you; ","I am no longer worthy to be called your son; treat me as one of your hired servants.\u201d\u2019","And he arose and came to his father. But while he was yet at a distance
 his father saw him and had compassion
 and ran and embraced him and kissed him. ","And the son said to him
 \u2018Father
 I have sinned against heaven and before you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son.\u2019 ","But the father said to his servants
 \u2018Bring quickly the best robe
 and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand
 and shoes on his feet; ","and bring the fatted calf and kill it
 and let us eat and make merry; ","for this my son was dead
 and is alive again; he was lost
 and is found.\u2019 And they began to make merry.","\u201cNow his elder son was in the field; and as he came and drew near to the house
 he heard music and dancing. ","And he called one of the servants and asked what this meant.","And he said to him
 \u2018Your brother has come
 and your father has killed the fatted calf
 because he has received him safe and sound.\u2019 ","But he was angry and refused to go in. His father came out and entreated him
 ","but he answered his father
 \u2018Lo
 these many years I have served you
 and I never disobeyed your command; yet you never gave me a kid
 that I might make merry with my friends. ","But when this son of yours came
 who has devoured your living with harlots
 you killed for him the fatted calf!\u2019 ","And he said to him
 \u2018Son
 you are always with me
 and all that is mine is yours. ","It was fitting to make merry and be glad
 for this your brother was dead
 and is alive; he was lost
 and is found.\u2019\u201d","He also said to the disciples
 \u201cThere was a rich man who had a steward
 and charges were brought to him that this man was wasting his goods. ","And he called him and said to him
 \u2018What is this that I hear about you? Turn in the account of your stewardship
 for you can no longer be steward.\u2019 ","And the steward said to himself
 \u2018What shall I do
 since my master is taking the stewardship away from me? I am not strong enough to dig
 and I am ashamed to beg. ","I have decided what to do
 so that people may receive me into their houses when I am put out of the stewardship.\u2019 ","So
 summoning his master\u2019s debtors one by one
 he said to the first
 \u2018How much do you owe my master?\u2019 ","He said
 \u2018A hundred measures of oil.\u2019 And he said to him
 \u2018Take your bill
 and sit down quickly and write fifty.\u2019 ","Then he said to another
 \u2018And how much do you owe?\u2019 He said
 \u2018A hundred measures of wheat.\u2019 He said to him
 \u2018Take your bill
 and write eighty.\u2019 ","The master commended the dishonest steward for his prudence; for the sons of this world are wiser in their own generation than the sons of light.","And I tell you
 make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous mammon
 so that when it fails they may receive you into the eternal habitations.","\u201cHe who is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much; and he who is dishonest in a very little is dishonest also in much.","If then you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon
 who will entrust to you the true riches? ","And if you have not been faithful in that which is another\u2019s
 who will give you that which is your own? ","No servant can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other
 or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.\u201d","But he said to them
 \u201cYou are those who justify yourselves before men
 but God knows your hearts; for what is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God.","\u201cThe law and the prophets were until John; since then the good news of the kingdom of God is preached
 and every one enters it violently. ","But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away
 than for one dot of the law to become void.","\u201cEvery one who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery
 and he who marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery.","\u201cThere was a rich man
 who was clothed in purple and fine linen and who feasted sumptuously every day. ","And at his gate lay a poor man named Laz\u2032arus
 full of sores
 ","who desired to be fed with what fell from the rich man\u2019s table; moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.","The poor man died and was carried by the angels to Abraham\u2019s bosom. The rich man also died and was buried;","and in Hades
 being in torment
 he lifted up his eyes
 and saw Abraham far off and Laz\u2032arus in his bosom. ","And he called out
 \u2018Father Abraham
 have mercy upon me
 and send Laz\u2032arus to dip the end of his finger in water and cool my tongue; for I am in anguish in this flame.\u2019 ","But Abraham said
 \u2018Son
 remember that you in your lifetime received your good things
 and Laz\u2032arus in like manner evil things; but now he is comforted here
 and you are in anguish. ","And besides all this
 between us and you a great chasm has been fixed
 in order that those who would pass from here to you may not be able
 and none may cross from there to us.\u2019 ","And he said
 \u2018Then I beg you
 father
 to send him to my father\u2019s house
 ","for I have five brothers
 so that he may warn them
 lest they also come into this place of torment.\u2019 ","But Abraham said
 \u2018They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.\u2019 ","And he said
 \u2018No
 father Abraham; but if some one goes to them from the dead
 they will repent.\u2019 ","He said to him
 \u2018If they do not hear Moses and the prophets
 neither will they be convinced if some one should rise from the dead.\u2019\u201d","And he said to his disciples
 \u201cTemptations to sin are sure to come; but woe to him by whom they come! ","It would be better for him if a millstone were hung round his neck and he were cast into the sea
 than that he should cause one of these little ones to sin. ","Take heed to yourselves; if your brother sins
 rebuke him
 and if he repents
 forgive him; ","and if he sins against you seven times in the day
 and turns to you seven times
 and says
 \u2018I repent
\u2019 you must forgive him.\u201d","And the Lord said
 \u201cIf you had faith as a grain of mustard seed

\u2019 and it would obey you.","\u201cWill any one of you
 who has a servant plowing or keeping sheep
 say to him when he has come in from the field
 \u2018Come at once and sit down at table\u2019? ","Will he not rather say to him
 \u2018Prepare supper for me
 and gird yourself and serve me
 till I eat and drink; and afterward you shall eat and drink\u2019? ","Does he thank the servant because he did what was commanded?","So you also
 when you have done all that is commanded you
 say
 \u2018We are unworthy servants; we have only done what was our duty.\u2019\u201d","On the way to Jerusalem he was passing along between Samar\u2032ia and Galilee.","When he saw them he said to them
 \u201cGo and show yourselves to the priests.\u201d And as they went they were cleansed. ","Then said Jesus
 \u201cWere not ten cleansed? Where are the nine? ","Was no one found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?\u201d","And he said to him
 \u201cRise and go your way; your faith has made you well.\u201d","Being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God was coming
 he answered them
 \u201cThe kingdom of God is not coming with signs to be observed; ","nor will they say
 \u2018Lo
 here it is!\u2019 or \u2018There!\u2019 for behold
 the kingdom of God is in the midst of you.\u201d","And he said to the disciples
 \u201cThe days are coming when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of man
 and you will not see it. ","And they will say to you
 \u2018Lo
 there!\u2019 or \u2018Lo
 here!\u2019 Do not go
 do not follow them. ","For as the lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one side to the other
 so will the Son of man be in his day. ","But first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.","As it was in the days of Noah
 so will it be in the days of the Son of man. ","They ate
 they drank
 they married
 they were given in marriage
 until the day when Noah entered the ark
 and the flood came and destroyed them all. ","Likewise as it was in the days of Lot\u2014they ate
 they drank
 they bought
 they sold
 they planted
 they built
 ","but on the day when Lot went out from Sodom fire and brimstone rained from heaven and destroyed them all\u2014","so will it be on the day when the Son of man is revealed.","On that day
 let him who is on the housetop
 with his goods in the house
 not come down to take them away; and likewise let him who is in the field not turn back. ","Remember Lot\u2019s wife.","Whoever seeks to gain his life will lose it
 but whoever loses his life will preserve it. ","I tell you
 in that night there will be two men in one bed; one will be taken and the other left. ","There will be two women grinding together; one will be taken and the other left.\u201d","And they said to him
 \u201cWhere
 Lord?\u201d He said to them
 \u201cWhere the body is
 there the eagles will be gathered together.\u201d","He said
 \u201cIn a certain city there was a judge who neither feared God nor regarded man; ","and there was a widow in that city who kept coming to him and saying
 \u2018Vindicate me against my adversary.\u2019 ","For a while he refused; but afterward he said to himself
 \u2018Though I neither fear God nor regard man
 ","yet because this widow bothers me
 I will vindicate her
 or she will wear me out by her continual coming.\u2019\u201d ","And the Lord said
 \u201cHear what the unrighteous judge says. ","And will not God vindicate his elect
 who cry to him day and night? Will he delay long over them? ","I tell you
 he will vindicate them speedily. Nevertheless
 when the Son of man comes
 will he find faith on earth?\u201d","\u201cTwo men went up into the temple to pray
 one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. ","The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself
 \u2018God
 I thank thee that I am not like other men
 extortioners
 unjust
 adulterers
 or even like this tax collector. ","I fast twice a week
 I give tithes of all that I get.\u2019 ","But the tax collector
 standing far off
 would not even lift up his eyes to heaven
 but beat his breast
 saying
 \u2018God
 be merciful to me a sinner!\u2019 ","I tell you
 this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for every one who exalts himself will be humbled
 but he who humbles himself will be exalted.\u201d","But Jesus called them to him
 saying
 \u201cLet the children come to me
 and do not hinder them; for to such belongs the kingdom of God. ","Truly
 I say to you
 whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it.\u201d","And Jesus said to him
 \u201cWhy do you call me good? No one is good but God alone. ","You know the commandments: \u2018Do not commit adultery
 Do not kill
 Do not steal
 Do not bear false witness
 Honor your father and mother.\u2019\u201d ","And he said
 \u201cAll these I have observed from my youth.\u201d ","And when Jesus heard it
 he said to him
 \u201cOne thing you still lack. Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor
 and you will have treasure in heaven; and come
 follow me.\u201d ","Jesus looking at him said
 \u201cHow hard it is for those who have riches to enter the kingdom of God! ","For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.\u201d","But he said
 \u201cWhat is impossible with men is possible with God.\u201d ","And he said to them
 \u201cTruly
 I say to you
 there is no man who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children
 for the sake of the kingdom of God
 ","who will not receive manifold more in this time
 and in the age to come eternal life.\u201d","And taking the twelve
 he said to them
 \u201cBehold
 we are going up to Jerusalem
 and everything that is written of the Son of man by the prophets will be accomplished. ","For he will be delivered to the Gentiles
 and will be mocked and shamefully treated and spit upon; ","they will scourge him and kill him
 and on the third day he will rise.\u201d ","But they understood none of these things; this saying was hid from them
 and they did not grasp what was said.","\u201cWhat do you want me to do for you?\u201d He said
 \u201cLord
 let me receive my sight.\u201d ","And Jesus said to him
 \u201cReceive your sight; your faith has made you well.\u201d ","And when Jesus came to the place
 he looked up and said to him
 \u201cZacchae\u2032us
 make haste and come down; for I must stay at your house today.\u201d ","And Zacchae\u2032us stood and said to the Lord
 \u201cBehold
 Lord
 the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have defrauded any one of anything
 I restore it fourfold.\u201d ","And Jesus said to him
 \u201cToday salvation has come to this house
 since he also is a son of Abraham. ","For the Son of man came to seek and to save the lost.\u201d","He said therefore
 \u201cA nobleman went into a far country to receive kingly power and then return. ","Calling ten of his servants
 he gave them ten pounds
 and said to them
 \u2018Trade with these till I come.\u2019 ","But his citizens hated him and sent an embassy after him
 saying
 \u2018We do not want this man to reign over us.\u2019 ","When he returned
 having received the kingly power
 he commanded these servants
 to whom he had given the money
 to be called to him
 that he might know what they had gained by trading. ","The first came before him
 saying
 \u2018Lord
 your pound has made ten pounds more.\u2019 ","And he said to him
 \u2018Well done
 good servant! Because you have been faithful in a very little
 you shall have authority over ten cities.\u2019 ","And the second came
 saying
 \u2018Lord
 your pound has made five pounds.\u2019 ","And he said to him
 \u2018And you are to be over five cities.\u2019 ","Then another came
 saying
 \u2018Lord
 here is your pound
 which I kept laid away in a napkin; ","for I was afraid of you
 because you are a severe man; you take up what you did not lay down
 and reap what you did not sow.\u2019 ","He said to him
 \u2018I will condemn you out of your own mouth
 you wicked servant! You knew that I was a severe man
 taking up what I did not lay down and reaping what I did not sow? ","Why then did you not put my money into the bank
 and at my coming I should have collected it with interest?\u2019 ","And he said to those who stood by
 \u2018Take the pound from him
 and give it to him who has the ten pounds.\u2019 ","(And they said to him
 \u2018Lord
 he has ten pounds!\u2019) ","\u2018I tell you
 that to every one who has will more be given; but from him who has not
 even what he has will be taken away. ","But as for these enemies of mine
 who did not want me to reign over them
 bring them here and slay them before me.\u2019\u201d","saying
 \u201cGo into the village opposite
 where on entering you will find a colt tied
 on which no one has ever yet sat; untie it and bring it here. ","If any one asks you
 \u2018Why are you untying it?\u2019 you shall say this
 \u2018The Lord has need of it.\u2019\u201d ","And some of the Pharisees in the multitude said to him
 \u201cTeacher
 rebuke your disciples.\u201d ","He answered
 \u201cI tell you
 if these were silent
 the very stones would cry out.\u201d","saying
 \u201cWould that even today you knew the things that make for peace! But now they are hid from your eyes. ","For the days shall come upon you
 when your enemies will cast up a bank about you and surround you
 and hem you in on every side
 ","and dash you to the ground
 you and your children within you

 \u201cIt is written
 \u2018My house shall be a house of prayer\u2019; but you have made it a den of robbers.\u201d","He answered them
 \u201cI also will ask you a question; now tell me
 ","Was the baptism of John from heaven or from men?\u201d","And Jesus said to them
 \u201cNeither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.\u201d","And he began to tell the people this parable: \u201cA man planted a vineyard
 and let it out to tenants
 and went into another country for a long while. ","When the time came
 he sent a servant to the tenants
 that they should give him some of the fruit of the vineyard; but the tenants beat him
 and sent him away empty-handed. ","And he sent another servant; him also they beat and treated shamefully
 and sent him away empty-handed. ","And he sent yet a third; this one they wounded and cast out.","Then the owner of the vineyard said
 \u2018What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; it may be they will respect him.\u2019 ","But when the tenants saw him
 they said to themselves
 \u2018This is the heir; let us kill him
 that the inheritance may be ours.\u2019 ","And they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?","He will come and destroy those tenants
 and give the vineyard to others.\u201d When they heard this
 they said
 \u201cGod forbid!\u201d ","But he looked at them and said
 \u201cWhat then is this that is written: \u2018The very stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner\u2019?","Every one who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces; but when it falls on any one it will crush him.\u201d","So they watched him
 and sent spies
 who pretended to be sincere
 that they might take hold of what he said
 so as to deliver him up to the authority and jurisdiction of the governor. ","\u201cShow me a coin. Whose likeness and inscription has it?\u201d They said
 \u201cCaesar\u2019s.\u201d ","He said to them
 \u201cThen render to Caesar the things that are Caesar\u2019s
 and to God the things that are God\u2019s.\u201d ","And they were not able in the presence of the people to catch him by what he said; but marveling at his answer they were silent.","And Jesus said to them
 \u201cThe sons of this age marry and are given in marriage; ","but those who are accounted worthy to attain to that age and to the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage
 ","for they cannot die any more
 because they are equal to angels and are sons of God
 being sons of the resurrection. ","But that the dead are raised
 even Moses showed
 in the passage about the bush
 where he calls the Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob. ","Now he is not God of the dead
 but of the living; for all live to him.\u201d ","But he said to them
 \u201cHow can they say that the Christ is David\u2019s son? ","For David himself says in the Book of Psalms
 \u2018The Lord said to my Lord
 Sit at my right hand
","till I make thy enemies a stool for thy feet.\u2019","David thus calls him Lord; so how is he his son?\u201d","\u201cBeware of the scribes
 who like to go about in long robes
 and love salutations in the market places and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at feasts
 ","who devour widows\u2019 houses and for a pretense make long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation.\u201d","And he said
 \u201cTruly I tell you
 this poor widow has put in more than all of them; ","for they all contributed out of their abundance
 but she out of her poverty put in all the living that she had.\u201d","\u201cAs for these things which you see
 the days will come when there shall not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down.\u201d ","And he said
 \u201cTake heed that you are not led astray; for many will come in my name
 saying
 \u2018I am he!\u2019 and
 \u2018The time is at hand!\u2019 Do not go after them. ","And when you hear of wars and tumults
 do not be terrified; for this must first take place
 but the end will not be at once.\u201d","Then he said to them
 \u201cNation will rise against nation
 and kingdom against kingdom; ","there will be great earthquakes
 and in various places famines and pestilences; and there will be terrors and great signs from heaven. ","But before all this they will lay their hands on you and persecute you
 delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons
 and you will be brought before kings and governors for my name\u2019s sake. ","This will be a time for you to bear testimony.","Settle it therefore in your minds
 not to meditate beforehand how to answer; ","for I will give you a mouth and wisdom
 which none of your adversaries will be able to withstand or contradict. ","You will be delivered up even by parents and brothers and kinsmen and friends
 and some of you they will put to death; ","you will be hated by all for my name\u2019s sake.","But not a hair of your head will perish.","By your endurance you will gain your lives.","\u201cBut when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies
 then know that its desolation has come near. ","Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains
 and let those who are inside the city depart
 and let not those who are out in the country enter it; ","for these are days of vengeance
 to fulfil all that is written. ","Alas for those who are with child and for those who give suck in those days! For great distress shall be upon the earth and wrath upon this people;","they will fall by the edge of the sword
 and be led captive among all nations; and Jerusalem will be trodden down by the Gentiles
 until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.","\u201cAnd there will be signs in sun and moon and stars
 and upon the earth distress of nations in perplexity at the roaring of the sea and the waves
 ","men fainting with fear and with foreboding of what is coming on the world; for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.","And then they will see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.","Now when these things begin to take place
 look up and raise your heads
 because your redemption is drawing near.\u201d","And he told them a parable: \u201cLook at the fig tree
 and all the trees; ","as soon as they come out in leaf
 you see for yourselves and know that the summer is already near. ","So also
 when you see these things taking place
 you know that the kingdom of God is near. ","Truly
 I say to you
 this generation will not pass away till all has taken place. ","Heaven and earth will pass away
 but my words will not pass away.","\u201cBut take heed to yourselves lest your hearts be weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and cares of this life
 and that day come upon you suddenly like a snare; ","for it will come upon all who dwell upon the face of the whole earth.","But watch at all times
 praying that you may have strength to escape all these things that will take place
 and to stand before the Son of man.\u201d","So Jesus sent Peter and John
 saying
 \u201cGo and prepare the passover for us

 \u201cBehold
 when you have entered the city

 where I am to eat the passover with my disciples?\u2019 ","And he will show you a large upper room furnished; there make ready.\u201d","And he said to them
 \u201cI have earnestly desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer; ","for I tell you I shall not eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.\u201d","And he took a cup
 and when he had given thanks he said
 \u201cTake this
 and divide it among yourselves; ","for I tell you that from now on I shall not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.\u201d","And he took bread
 and when he had given thanks he broke it and gave it to them

 \u201cThis is my body which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me.\u201d ","And likewise the cup after supper

 \u201cThis cup which is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood. ","But behold the hand of him who betrays me is with me on the table.","For the Son of man goes as it has been determined; but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed!\u201d","And he said to them
 \u201cThe kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and those in authority over them are called benefactors. ","But not so with you; rather let the greatest among you become as the youngest

 one who sits at table
 or one who serves? Is it not the one who sits at table? But I am among you as one who serves.","\u201cYou are those who have continued with me in my trials;","as my Father appointed a kingdom for me

 Satan demanded to have you
 that he might sift you like wheat

 strengthen your brethren.\u201d ","And he said to him
 \u201cLord
 I am ready to go with you to prison and to death.\u201d ","He said
 \u201cI tell you

 \u201cNothing.\u201d ","He said to them

 Yeshua told him
 \u201cIt is written

 \u201cGo and show yourself to the kohen. Then bring an offering for your cleansing
 just as Moses commanded
 as a testimony to them.\u201d","When He saw their faith
 He said
 \u201cMan
 your sins are forgiven.\u201d","Yeshua
 knowing their thoughts
 replied to them
 \u201cWhy are you raising questions in your hearts?","Which is easier
 to say
 \u2018Your sins are forgiven you
\u2019 or to say
 \u2018Get up and walk\u2019?","But so you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to pardon sins.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d He said to the paralyzed one
 \u201cI tell you
 get up and take your cot
 and go home!\u201d","After these things
 Yeshua went out and observed a tax collector named Levi
 sitting at the tax booth. He said to him
 \u201cFollow Me.\u201d","And Yeshua answered and said to them
 \u201cThose who are healthy have no need for a doctor
 but those who are sick do.","I did not come to call the righteous
 but the sinful to repentance.\u201d","But they said to Him
 \u201cJohn\u2019s disciples often fast and offer prayers
 as do the disciples of the Pharisees. But Your disciples are eating and drinking.\u201d","But Yeshua said to them
 \u201cYou cannot make the guests of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them
 can you?","But the days will come; and when the bridegroom is taken away from them
 then they will fast in those days.\u201d","Now he was also telling them a parable. \u201cNo one tears a patch from a new garment to use it on an old garment. Otherwise he will rip the new
 and the patch from the new will not match the old.","And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise
 the new wine will burst the skins
 it will be spilled out
 and the skins will be destroyed.","But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins.","No man who drinks old wine wants new
 because he says
 \u2018The old is fine.\u2019\u201d","Then answering them
 Yeshua said
 \u201cHaven\u2019t you read what David did when he was hungry
 and those with him?","How he entered into the house of God
 took and ate the showbread which only the kohanim are permitted to eat
 and even gave it to those with him?\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cThe Son of Man is Lord of Shabbat.\u201d","But He knew their opinions and said to the man with the paralyzed hand
 \u201cGet up and stand in our midst.\u201d And getting up
 the man stood.","Yeshua said to them
 \u201cI ask you
 is it permitted on Shabbat to do good or to do evil
 to save or to destroy a life?\u201d","Then looking around at everyone
 He said to the man
 \u201cStretch out your hand.\u201d The man did
 and his hand was restored.","Blessed are you who hunger now
 for you shall be satisfied. Blessed are you who weep now
 for you shall laugh.","Blessed are you when people hate you
 and when they exclude you
 and revile you
 and spurn your name as evil on account of the Son of Man.","Rejoice in that day and jump for joy! For behold
 your reward is great in heaven! For their fathers used to treat the prophets the same way.\u201d","But woe to you who are rich
 for you are receiving your comfort in full.","Woe to you who are full
 for you shall be hungry. Woe to you who are laughing now
 for you shall mourn and weep.","Woe to you when all men speak well of you
 for their fathers used to treat the false prophets the same way.\u201d","\u201cBut I say to you who are listening: Love your enemies
 do good to those who hate you
","bless those who curse you
 pray for the ones who mistreat you.","To the one who strikes you on the cheek
 offer the other also. And from the one who takes your cloak
 do not hold back your shirt.","Give to every one who asks you; and whoever takes something of yours
 make no demands upon him.","\u201cDo to others as you would have them do to you.","If you love those who love you
 what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them.","And if you do good to those who are doing good to you
 what credit is that to you? Even sinners do this.","And if you lend to those from whom you expect to take
 what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners in order to receive back the same.","\u201cBut love your enemies
 and do good
 and lend
 expecting nothing in return. Then your reward will be great and you will be sons of Elyon
 for He is kind to the ungrateful and evil ones.","Be compassionate
 just as your Father is compassionate to you.\u201d","Do not judge
 and you will not be judged. Do not condemn
 and you will not be condemned. Pardon
 and you will be pardoned.","Give
 and it will be given to you\u2014a good measure
 pressed down
 shaken together
 overflowing
 will be given into your lap. For whatever measure you measure out will be measured back to you.\u201d","He also spoke this parable to them: \u201cThe blind cannot show the way to the blind
 can he? Won\u2019t they both fall into a pit?","A disciple is not above his teacher
 but everyone who is fully trained will be like his teacher.","\u201cWhy do you look at the speck in your brother\u2019s eye
 but do not notice the beam in your own eye?","How can you say to your brother
 \u2018Brother
 let me take out the speck in your eye
\u2019 when you yourself do not see the beam in your own eye? You hypocrite! First take the beam out of your own eye
 and then you will see clearly the speck in your brother\u2019s eye
 to take it out.\u201d","\u201cFor there is no good tree that produces rotten fruit
 nor again does a rotten tree produce good fruit.","Each tree comes to be known by its own fruit. For figs are not gleaned out of briars; neither are bunches of grapes gathered from thorn bushes.","\u201cOut of the good treasure of his heart the good man brings forth good
 and out of evil the evil man brings forth evil. For from the overflow of the heart his mouth speaks.\u201d","\u201cWhy do you call Me \u2018Master
 Master\u2019 and do not do what I say?","Everyone who comes to Me and hears My words and does them
 I will show you what he is like.","He is like a man building a house
 who dug deep and laid a foundation on the rock. And when a flood came
 the torrent burst against that house but could not shake it
 because it had been well built.","\u201cBut the one who hears yet does not do is like a man who built a house upon land without a foundation. When the torrent burst against it
 immediately it collapsed\u2014and the destruction of that house was great!\u201d","Now when Yeshua heard this
 He was amazed at him. Turning to the crowd following Him
 He said
 \u201cI tell you
 not even in Israel have I found such great faith.\u201d","When the Lord saw her
 He felt compassion for her and said
 \u201cDon\u2019t cry.\u201d","Then He came up and touched the coffin
 and the pallbearers came to a standstill. He said
 \u201cYoung man! I tell you
 get up!\u201d","And answering
 He said to them
 \u201cGo report to John what you saw and heard: the blind see
 the lame walk
 those with tzara\u2019at are cleansed
 the deaf hear
 the dead are raised
 and the poor have good news proclaimed to them.","Blessed is he who is not led to stumble because of Me.\u201d","And after John\u2019s messengers left
 He began to speak about John to the crowds. \u201cWhat did you go out to the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?","No? So what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine garments? Look
 those who wear finery and live in luxury are in the palaces of kings!","Then what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes
 I tell you
 even more than a prophet.","This is the one about whom it is written
 \u2018Behold
 I send My messenger before You
 who will prepare Your way before You.\u2019","I say to you
 there is no one greater than John among those born of women; yet the least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.\u201d","\u201cSo then
 to what shall I compare the people of this generation? What are they like?","They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling to each other
 saying
 \u2018We played the flute for you
 and you didn\u2019t dance. We sang a dirge
 and you didn\u2019t weep.\u2019","\u201cFor John the Immerser has come not eating bread nor drinking wine

 \u2018He has a demon.\u2019","The Son of Man has come eating and drinking. and you say
 \u2018Look
 a glutton and a drunkard
 a friend of tax collectors and sinners!\u2019","Yet wisdom is vindicated by all her children.\u201d","Now when the Pharisee who invited Him saw this
 he said to himself
 \u201cIf this were a prophet
 He would know what sort of woman is touching Him\u2014that she\u2019s a sinner.\u201d","And answering
 Yeshua said to him
 \u201cSimon
 I have something to say to you.\u201d And he said
 \u201cSay it
 Teacher!\u201d","\u201cA moneylender had two debtors. One owed him five hundred denarii
 but the other fifty.","When neither could repay him
 he canceled both debts. So which of them will love him more?\u201d","Simon replied
 \u201cI suppose the one who had the bigger debt canceled.\u201d \u201cYou have judged correctly
\u201d Yeshua said.","Turning toward the woman
 He said to Simon
 \u201cDo you see this woman? I entered into your house
 and you didn\u2019t give Me water for My feet. But she has drenched My feet with tears and wiped them with her hair.","You didn\u2019t greet Me with a kiss; but from the time she entered
 she has not stopped kissing My feet.","You didn\u2019t anoint My head with oil
 but she has anointed My feet with perfume.","For this reason I tell you
 her sins
 which are many
 have been forgiven\u2014for she loved much. But the one who is forgiven little
 loves little.","He then said to her
 \u201cYour sins have been forgiven.\u201d","Then He said to the woman
 \u201cYour faith has saved you. Go in shalom.\u201d","And when a large crowd was gathering and those from various towns were traveling to Him
 He spoke by means of a parable.","\u201cThe sower went out to spread his seed. As he sowed
 some fell beside the road and was trampled; and the birds of the air ate it up.","And other seed fell on rock; when it came up
 that seed withered away because it had no moisture.","Other seed fell among the thorns
 and the thorns grew up with it and choked it.","And other seed fell into the good soil; and when it came up
 it produced fruit a hundredfold.\u201d While saying these things
 He would call out
 \u201cHe who has ears to hear
 let him hear.\u201d","Then Yeshua said to them
 \u201cTo you has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of God; but to the others it is given in parables
 in order that \u2018Seeing
 they may not see
 and hearing
 they may not understand.\u2019","\u201cNow the parable is this: the seed is the word of God.","Those beside the road are the ones who have heard; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their heart
 so that they may not believe and be saved.","But those on the rocky places are the ones who
 when they hear
 accept the word with joy. But these have no root; they believe for a season
 and in a time of testing fall away.","Now that which fell into the thorns are those who were hearing; but as they go along the way
 they are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life
 and they do not bear mature fruit.","But the seed in the good soil are those with a praiseworthy and good heart
 who have heard the word and hold it fast and bear fruit with patient endurance.","\u201cNow no one after lighting a lamp covers it with some object or places it under a bed. But he puts it on a lampstand so that all those who enter may be able to see the light.","For nothing is hidden that will not become evident
 nor secret that shall not be known and come into open view.","So pay attention how you listen. For whoever has
 to him more will be given. And whoever does not have
 even what he supposes he has will be taken away from him.\u201d","Now it was reported to Him
 \u201cYour mother and Your brothers are standing outside
 wanting to see You.\u201d","But answering
 He said to them
 \u201cMy mother and My brothers are these who are hearing the word of God and doing it.\u201d","Now on one of those days Yeshua and His disciples got into a boat
 and He said to them
 \u201cLet\u2019s move to the other side of the lake.\u201d So they set out.","Then Yeshua said to them
 \u201cWhere is your faith?\u201d But they were afraid and marveled
 saying to one another
 \u201cWho then is this? He commands even the winds and the water
 and they obey Him!\u201d","Yeshua questioned him
 \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d \u201cLegion
\u201d he said
 for many demons had entered him.","\u201cReturn to your home
 and describe all that God has done for you.\u201d So he went away
 proclaiming throughout the whole town all that Yeshua had done for him.","Yeshua said
 \u201cWho touched Me?\u201d When everyone denied it
 Peter said
 \u201cMaster
 the crowds are surrounding You and pressing in!\u201d","But Yeshua said
 \u201cSomeone touched Me
 for I recognized power going out from Me.\u201d","He said to her
 \u201cDaughter
 your faith has made you well. Go in shalom.\u201d","But hearing this
 Yeshua replied to him
 \u201cDo not fear\u2014just keep trusting
 and she shall be restored.\u201d","And everyone was weeping and lamenting her; but He said
 \u201cDon\u2019t weep
 for she didn\u2019t die but is sleeping.\u201d","But Yeshua
 took her by the hand and called out
 saying
 \u201cChild
 get up!\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cTake nothing for the journey\u2014no walking stick
 no travel bag
 no bread
 no money
 nor even to have two shirts.","Whatever house you enter
 stay there and depart from there.","And whoever does not receive you
 when you leave that town
 shake off the dust from your feet as a witness against them.\u201d","But Yeshua said to them
 \u201cYou give them something to eat!\u201d But they said
 \u201cWe have no more than five loaves of bread and two fish
 unless we go to buy food for all these people.\u201d","For there were about five thousand men. Then Yeshua said to His disciples
 \u201cHave the people recline in groups of about fifty each.\u201d","Once when Yeshua was praying alone and His disciples were near
 He put a question to them
 saying
 \u201cWho do the crowds say that I am?\u201d","Then He said to them
 \u201cBut who do you that say I am?\u201d Then Peter answered and said
 \u201cThe Messiah of God.\u201d","saying
 \u201cThe Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and ruling kohanim and Torah scholars
 and be killed
 and on the third day be raised.\u201d","Then Yeshua was saying to everyone
 \u201cIf anyone wants to follow Me
 he must deny himself
 take up his cross every day
 and follow Me.","For whoever wants to save his life will lose it
 but whoever loses his life for My sake will save it.","\u201cFor what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world but loses or forfeits himself?","For whoever is ashamed of Me and My words
 the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when He comes in His glory and the glory of the Father and the holy angels.","But I tell you truthfully
 there are some standing here who will never taste death until they see the kingdom of God.\u201d","And as they were leaving Yeshua
 Peter said to Him
 \u201cMaster
 it\u2019s good for us to be here. Let\u2019s make three sukkot: one for You
 and one for Moses
 and one for Elijah\u201d\u2014not knowing what he was saying.","Then answering
 Yeshua said
 \u201cO faithless and twisted generation
 how long shall I be with you and put up with you? Bring your son here.\u201d","\u201cPut these words into your ears: the Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men.\u201d","He said to them
 \u201cWhoever welcomes this child in My name
 welcomes Me. And whoever welcomes Me
 welcomes the One who sent Me. The one who is the least among all of you is the one who is great.\u201d","Yeshua said to him
 \u201cDo not stop him
 for he who is not against you is for you.\u201d","But Yeshua said to him
 \u201cFoxes have dens and birds of the air have nests
 but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head.\u201d","He said to another
 \u201cFollow Me.\u201d But that one said
 \u201cFirst let me go and bury my father.\u201d","But Yeshua said to him
 \u201cLet the dead bury their own dead. But you
 go and proclaim the kingdom of God.\u201d","But Yeshua said to him
 \u201cNo one who has put his hand to the plow and looked back is fit for the kingdom of God.\u201d","And He was telling them
 \u201cThe harvest is plentiful
 but the workers are few. Therefore
 beg the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into His harvest.","\u201cGo forth! Look
 I am sending you as lambs in the midst of wolves.","Do not be burdened with a money belt
 travel bag
 or shoes; and do not greet anyone along the way.","Whatever home you enter
 first say
 \u201cShalom be on this home.\u201d","If a son of shalom is there
 your shalom will rest on him; but if not
 it will return to you.","And remain in this same home
 eating and drinking the things they offer
 for the worker is deserving of his wage. Do not keep moving from house to house.","\u201cWhatever town you enter and they welcome you
 eat what they set before you.","Then heal the sick in that town
 and say to them
 \u2018The kingdom of God has come near to you.\u2019","But if you enter a town and they do not welcome you
 then go out into its streets and say
","\u2018Even the dust of your town sticking to our feet
 we wipe off as a witness to you. But know this! The kingdom of God has come near.\u2019","I tell you
 it will be more tolerable for Sodom on that day than for that town.","\u201cWoe to you
 Chorazin! Woe to you
 Bethsaida! For if the miracles done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon
 they would have turned long ago
 sitting in sackcloth and ashes.","Yet it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon at the Judgment than for you!","And you
 Capernaum? You won\u2019t be lifted up to heaven
 will you? No
 you will go down as far as Sheol.","The one who listens to you hears Me
 and the one who rejects you rejects Me
 and the one who rejects Me rejects the One who sent Me.\u201d","And Yeshua said to them
 \u201cI was watching satan fall like lightning from heaven.","Behold
 I have given you authority to trample upon serpents and scorpions
 and over all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you.","Nevertheless
 do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you
 but rejoice that your names have been written in the heavens.\u201d","In that very hour
 He was overjoyed in the Ruach ha-Kodesh and said
 \u201cI praise You
 Father
 Master of the universe
 that You have hidden these things from the wise and discerning and revealed them to infants. Yes
 Father
 for this way was pleasing to You.","All things have been handed over to Me by My Father. No one knows who the Son is except the Father
 and who the Father is except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal Him.\u201d","Then turning to the disciples
 He said privately
 \u201cBlessed are the eyes that see what you see!","For I tell you
 many prophets and kings desired to see what you are seeing yet did not see
 and to hear what you are hearing yet did not hear.\u201d","Now a certain Torah lawyer stood up to entrap Yeshua
 saying
 \u201cTeacher
 what should I do to gain eternal life?\u201d","Then Yeshua said to him
 \u201cWhat has been written in the Torah? How do you read it?\u201d","Yeshua said to him
 \u201cYou have answered correctly. Do this and you will live.\u201d","Yeshua replied
 \u201cA certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho. He was attacked by robbers
 who stripped him and beat him. Then they left
 abandoning him as half dead.","And by chance
 a kohen was going down that road; but when he saw the man
 he passed by on the opposite side.","Likewise a Levite also
 when he came to the place and saw him
 passed by on the opposite side.","But a Samaritan who was traveling came upon him; and when he noticed the man
 he felt compassion.","He went up to him and bandaged his wounds
 pouring on olive oil and wine. Then setting him on his own animal
 he brought him to a lodge for travelers and took care of him.","The next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper
 saying
 \u2018Take care of him. And whatever else you spend
 upon my return I will repay you myself.\u2019","Which of these three seems to you a neighbor to the one attacked by robbers?\u201d","And he said
 \u201cThe one who showed mercy to him.\u201d Then Yeshua said to him
 \u201cGo
 and you do the same.\u201d","But answering her
 the Lord said
 \u201cMartha
 Martha
 you are anxious and bothered about many things;","but only one thing is necessary. For Miriam has chosen the good part
 which will not be taken away from her.\u201d","Now Yeshua was praying in a certain place. When He finished
 one of His disciples said to Him
 \u201cMaster
 teach us to pray
 just as John taught his disciples.\u201d","Then Yeshua said to them
 \u201cWhen you pray
 say
 \u2018Father
 sanctified be Your Name
 Your kingdom come.","Give us each day our daily bread.","And forgive us our sins
 for we also forgive everyone indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation.\u201d","Then Yeshua said to them
 \u201cWhich of you has a friend and will go to him in the middle of the night and say to him
 \u2018Friend
 lend me three loaves of bread
","because a friend of mine has come to me on his journey and I have nothing to set before him.\u2019","Then from within he may answer
 saying
 \u2018Don\u2019t bother me. The door is already locked
 and my children and I are in bed. I can\u2019t get up to give you anything.\u2019","I tell you
 even if the friend will not get up and give him anything out of friendship
 yet because of the man\u2019s persistence he will get up and give him as much as he needs.","\u201cSo I say to you
 \u2018Ask
 and it shall be given to you. Seek
 and you shall find. Knock
 and it shall be opened to you.","For everyone who asks receives
 and the one who seeks finds
 and to the one who knocks it will be opened.\u2019","What father
 if his son asks for a fish
 will give him a snake instead?","And if he asks for an egg
 will he give him a scorpion?","If you then
 being evil
 know how to give good gifts to your children
 how much more will your heavenly Father give the Ruach ha-Kodesh to those who ask Him!\u201d","Now Yeshua was driving out a demon
 and it was mute. When the demon had gone out
 the mute one spoke and the crowds were amazed.","But Yeshua
 knowing their thoughts
 said to them
 \u201cEvery kingdom divided against itself is destroyed
 and a house against a house falls.","Now if satan is divided against himself
 how will his kingdom stand? For you say by beelzebul I drive out the demons.","But if by beelzebul I drive out demons
 by whom do your sons drive them out? For this reason
 they will be your judges.","But if by the finger of God I drive out demons
 then the kingdom of God has come to you.","\u201cWhen a strong one
 fully-armed
 protects his own estate
 his possessions are safe.","But as soon as someone stronger than he attacks and overpowers him
 then he takes away the armor that he had trusted in and divides up his plunder.","He who is not with Me is against Me
 and he who does not gather with Me scatters.","\u201cWhen an unclean spirit goes out of a man
 it passes through waterless places looking for rest. Not finding any
 it says
 \u2018I will return to my house where I came from.\u2019","And when it comes
 it finds the house swept and put in order.","Then it goes and takes along seven other spirits more evil than itself
 and they go in and settle there. And that man\u2019s last condition becomes worse than the first.\u201d","Then as Yeshua was saying these things
 a certain woman in the crowd
 raising her voice
 said to Him
 \u201cBlessed is the womb that carried You and the breasts that nursed You!\u201d","But He said
 \u201cRather
 blessed are those who hear the word of God and obey it.\u201d","With the crowds increasing
 Yeshua began to say
 \u201cThis generation is a wicked generation. It demands a sign
 yet no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah.","For just as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites
 so also the Son of Man will be to this generation.","The Queen of the South will rise up at the Judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them
 for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon. And behold
 something greater than Solomon is here.","The men of Nineveh will rise at the judgment with this generation and will condemn it
 because they repented at Jonah\u2019s proclamation. And indeed
 one greater than Jonah is here.","\u201cNo one lighting a lamp puts it in a cellar or under a basket
 but on the lampstand so that those entering may see the light.","Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eye is healthy
 your whole body is full of light. But when it is sick
 your body is full of darkness.","Therefore
 watch out that the light in you is not darkness.","If then your body is full of light
 with no part of it dark
 it will be as full of light as when a lamp gives you light with its gleam.\u201d","But the Lord said to him
 \u201cYou Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and plate
 but inside you are full of greed and wickedness.","Fools! Didn\u2019t He who created the outside also create the inside?","But give as tzedakah those things that are within
 and indeed everything is pure to you.","\u201cBut woe to you Pharisees
 for you tithe mint
 rue
 and every garden herb
 yet bypass justice and the love of God. It is necessary to do these things without neglecting the others.","Woe to you Pharisees
 for you love the best seats in the synagogues and the greetings in the marketplaces.","Woe to you
 for you are like unmarked tombs
 and people walk over them without knowing.\u201d","Then Yeshua said
 \u201cWoe to you Torah lawyers as well
 for you weigh the people down with burdens hard to carry
 yet you yourselves will not touch the burdens with even a finger.","\u201cWoe to you
 for you build the tombs of the prophets whom your own fathers killed!","So you are witnesses and approve the deeds of your fathers
 for indeed they killed them and you are building their tombs.","\u201cFor this reason also the wisdom of God said
 \u2018I will send them prophets and emissaries
 and some of them they will kill and persecute
","so that the blood of the prophets shed since the foundation of the world might be required from this generation\u2014","from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah
 the one who perished between the altar and the house of God. Yes
 I tell you
 it will be required from this generation.\u2019","\u201cWoe to you
 Torah lawyers
 for you have taken away the key of knowledge. You yourselves did not enter
 and you stood in the way of those entering.\u201d","Meanwhile
 when thousands of people had gathered
 so many that they were trampling one another
 Yeshua began speaking first to His disciples
 \u201cBe on guard yourselves against the hametz of the Pharisees
 which is hypocrisy.","There is nothing covered up that will not be revealed
 and nothing hidden that will not be made known.","Therefore
 whatever you have said in the dark will be heard in the light
 and what you have spoken in private rooms will be proclaimed from the housetops.","\u201cI say to you
 My friends
 you should not be afraid of those who kill the body
 since after this they have nothing more they can do.","But I will show you whom you should fear. Fear the One who
 after the killing
 has authority to cast into Gehenna. Yes
 I tell you
 fear this One!","\u201cAren\u2019t five sparrows being sold for two pennies? Yet not one of them is forgotten before God.","Indeed
 even the hairs of your head are all numbered. So do not fear; you are more valuable than many sparrows.","Now I tell you
 whoever acknowledges Me before men
 the Son of Man also will acknowledge him before the angels of God.","But the one who denies Me before men will be denied before the angels of God.","And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven
 but the one who slanders the Ruach ha-Kodesh will not be forgiven.","And when they bring you to the synagogues
 rulers
 and authorities
 do not worry about how you should defend yourself or what you should say
","because the Ruach ha-Kodesh will teach you at that time what is necessary to say.\u201d","But Yeshua said to him
 \u201cMan
 who made Me a judge or arbitrator over you?\u201d","Then He said to them
 \u201cWatch out! Be on guard against all kinds of greed
 because one\u2019s life does not consist in the abundance of the material goods he possesses.\u201d","And Yeshua told them a parable
 saying
 \u201cThe land of a certain rich man produced good crops.","And he began thinking to himself
 saying
 \u2018What shall I do? I don\u2019t have a place to store my harvest!\u2019","And he said
 \u2018Here\u2019s what I\u2019ll do! I\u2019ll tear down my barns and build larger ones
 and there I\u2019ll store all my grain and my goods.","And I\u2019ll say to myself
 \u2019O my soul
 you have plenty of goods saved up for many years! So take it easy! Eat
 drink
 and be merry.\u201d\u2019","But God said to him
 \u2018You fool! Tonight your soul is being demanded back from you! And what you have prepared
 whose will that be?\u2019","So it is with the one who stores up treasure for himself and is not rich in God.\u201d","Then Yeshua said to His disciples
 \u201cSo I say to you
 do not worry about life
 what you will eat; nor about the body
 what you will wear.","For life is more than food and the body more than clothing.","Consider the ravens. They do not sow or reap
 they have no storeroom or barn
 yet God feeds them. How much more valuable you are than birds!","\u201cAnd which of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life?","So if you cannot do even something very little
 why do you worry about other things?","Consider the lilies
 how they grow. They neither toil nor spin. Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed like one of these.","But if God so clothes the grass in the field\u2014which is here today and thrown into the furnace tomorrow\u2014then how much more will He clothe you
 O you of little faith?","\u201cSo do not seek what you will eat and what you will drink
 and do not keep worrying.","For all the nations of the world strive after these things. But your Father knows that you need these things.","Instead
 seek His kingdom
 and these things shall be added to you.","Do not be afraid
 little flock
 for your Father chose to give you the kingdom.","\u201cSell your possessions and do tzedakah. Make money pouches for yourselves that do not get old\u2014a treasure in the heavens that never runs out
 where no thief approaches and no moth destroys.","For where your treasure is
 there will your heart be also.","\u201cHave your belt strapped on and lamps burning.","Be like people waiting for their master to return from a wedding feast
 so that when he comes and knocks
 they may open to him immediately.","\u201cHappy are those slaves whose master finds them alert when he comes. Amen
 I tell you
 he will prepare himself and have them recline at table
 and will come and serve them.","\u201cAnd if he comes in the second or even the third watch and finds them so
 they will be happy.","But understand this
 that if the master of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming
 he would not have allowed his house to be broken into.","You also must be ready
 for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you don\u2019t expect.\u201d","And the Lord said
 \u201cWho then is the faithful and wise manager
 whom the master will put in charge of his servants
 to give them their food portion at the proper time?","Blessed is that servant whose master finds him so doing when he comes.","Truly I tell you
 his master will put him in charge of all his possessions.","\u201cBut if that servant says in his heart
 \u2018My master is taking a long time to come
\u2019 and he begins to beat the young slave boys and girls and to eat and drink and get drunk
","the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know. And he will cut him in two and assign him a place with the unfaithful.","\u201cThat slave who knew his master\u2019s will but did not prepare or act according to his desire will be harshly whipped.","But the one who did not know and did things worthy of a beating will be whipped lightly. From everyone given much
 much will be required; and from the one for whom more is provided
 all the more they will ask of him.","\u201cI came to pour out fire on the earth
 and how I wish it were already ablaze!","But I have an immersion to endure
 and how distressed I am until it is finished!","\u201cDo you suppose that I have come to bring shalom on earth? No
 I tell you
 but rather division.","From now on there will be five in one house in opposition
 three against two and two against three.","They will be divided
 father against son and son against father
 mother against daughter and daughter against mother
 mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.\u201d","Then He also was saying to the crowds
 \u201cWhen you see a cloud rising in the west
 instantly you say
 \u2018A rainstorm is coming\u2019\u2014and so it is.","And when a south wind is blowing
 you say
 \u2018It will be a scorcher\u2019\u2014and so it is.","Hypocrites! The surface of the earth and sky you know how to interpret yet you don\u2019t know how to interpret this present time?","Why can\u2019t you judge for yourselves what is right?","For while you are going with your accuser to the authorities
 make an effort to come to a settlement with him\u2014so he doesn\u2019t drag you before the judge
 and the judge hand you over to the officer of the court
 and the officer of the court throw you into prison.","I tell you
 you will never get out of there until you have paid back the last little bit.\u201d","He answered and said to them
 \u201cDo you suppose that these Galileans are worse sinners than the rest of the Galileans because they have suffered these things?","No
 I tell you! But unless you repent
 you all will perish the same way.","\u201cOr those eighteen upon whom the tower in Siloam fell and were killed
 do you suppose that they are worse sinners than all the people living in Jerusalem?","No
 I tell you! But unless you repent
 you all will perish the same way.","Then Yeshua began telling this parable: \u201cA man had a fig tree he had planted in his vineyard
 and he came looking for fruit on it and found none.","So he said to the gardener
 \u2018Indeed
 for three years I\u2018ve come searching for fruit on this fig tree and found none. Remove it! Why does it use up the ground?\u2019","\u201cBut answering
 the gardener said to him
 \u2018Master
 leave it alone for this year also
 until I dig around it and apply fertilizer.","And if it bears fruit
 good. But if not
 cut it down.\u2019\u201d","When Yeshua saw her
 He called out to her and said
 \u201cWoman
 you are set free from your disability.\u201d","But the Lord answered him and said
 \u201cHypocrites! On Shabbat doesn\u2019t each of you untie his ox or donkey from the stall and lead it away to give it drink?","So this one
 a daughter of Abraham incapacitated by satan for eighteen years
 shouldn\u2019t she be set free from this imprisonment on Yom Shabbat?\u201d","So Yeshua was saying
 \u201cWhat is the kingdom of God like? To what shall I compare it?","It is like a mustard seed
 which a man took and dropped into his own garden. It grew and became a tree
 and the birds of the air nested in its branches.\u201d","Again He said
 \u201cTo what shall I compare the kingdom of God?","It is like hametz
 which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour
 until it was all leavened.","And someone said to Him
 \u201cMaster
 are only a few being saved?\u201d Then Yeshua said to them
","\u201cMake every effort to enter through the narrow door; for many
 I tell you
 will try to enter and will not be able.","Once the Master of the household gets up and shuts the door
 and you\u2019re standing outside and begin knocking on the door
 saying
 \u2018Master
 open up for us
\u2019 then He will say to you
 \u2018I don\u2019t know where you come from.\u2019","Then you will start to say
 \u2018We ate and drank in Your company
 and You taught in our streets.\u2019","But He will say
 \u2018I tell you
 I don\u2019t know where you come from. Get away from Me
 all of you evildoers!\u2019\u201d","\u201cThere will be weeping and the gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God
 but you yourselves thrown out.","And they will come from the east and west and from the north and south
 and they will recline at table in the kingdom of God.","And indeed
 some are last who shall be first
 and some are first who shall be last.\u201d","But Yeshua said to them
 \u201cGo and tell that fox
 \u2018Indeed
 I\u2019m driving out demons and performing healings today and tomorrow
 and on the third day I will reach My goal.\u2019","But I must keep going today and tomorrow because it just can\u2019t be that a prophet would perish outside Jerusalem.","\u201cO Jerusalem
 Jerusalem who kills the prophets and stones those sent to her! How often I longed to gather your children together
 as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings
 but you were not willing.","Look
 your house is left to you desolate! For I tell you
 you will never see Me until you say
 \u2018Baruch ha-ba b\u2019shem Adonai. Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!\u2019\u201d","So Yeshua said to the Torah lawyers and the Pharisees
 \u201cIs it permitted to heal on Shabbat
 or not?\u201d","Then He said to them
 \u201cWhich of you
 with a son or an ox falling into a well on Yom Shabbat
 will not immediately pull him out?\u201d","\u201cWhen you are invited by someone to a wedding
 don\u2019t take the seat of honor
 for someone more highly esteemed than you may have been invited by him.","Then the one who invited both of you will come to you and say
 \u2018Give up this seat.\u2019 And with shame
 you would proceed to take the lowest seat.","But when you are invited
 go and recline in the lowest seat so that when the one who invited you comes
 he may say to you
 \u2018Friend
 move up higher.\u2019 Then you shall be honored in the presence of all those who are dining with you.","For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled
 and the one who humbles himself will be exalted.\u201d","Then Yeshua was also saying to the one who invited Him
 \u201cWhen you host a luncheon or dinner
 don\u2019t invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors. Otherwise they might invite you in return as your payback.","But when you host a banquet
 invite the poor
 the crippled
 the lame
 and the blind;","and you will be blessed
 since they cannot repay you. You will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.\u201d","Now hearing this
 one of those dining with Yeshua said to Him
 \u201cBlessed is he who eats bread in the kingdom of God.\u201d","But Yeshua said to him
 \u201cA certain man was hosting a large banquet
 and he invited many.","At the time for the banquet
 he sent his slave to tell those who had been invited
 \u2018Come
 everything is already prepared.\u2019","\u201cBut every one of them began to beg off. The first said to him
 \u2018I bought a farm
 and I\u2019m obligated to go out to see it. I\u2019m asking you to have me excused.\u2019","Then another one said
 \u2018I\u2019ve purchased five teams of oxen
 and I\u2019m going to check them out. I\u2019m asking you to have me excused.\u2019","Still another said
 \u2018I\u2019ve married a wife
 so I cannot come.\u2019","\u201cThe slave came and reported these things to his master. Then the master of the house got angry and said to his slave
 \u2018Quickly go out into the squares and alleys of the city and bring here the poor
 the maimed
 the blind
 and the lame.\u2019","\u201cAnd the slave said
 \u2018Master
 I have done as you instructed
 and still there is room.\u2019","\u201cSo the master said to the slave
 \u2018Go out into the thoroughfares and fenced areas
 and press them to come in so my home may be filled.","For I tell you
 none of those men who were invited will taste my banquet.\u2019\u201d","Now great crowds were traveling with Yeshua; and He turned and said to them
","\u201cIf anyone comes to Me and does not hate his own father
 mother
 wife
 children
 brothers
 and sisters\u2014and yes
 even his own life\u2014he cannot be My disciple.","Whoever does not carry his own cross and follow Me cannot be My disciple.","\u201cFor which of you
 wanting to build a tower
 doesn\u2019t first sit down and figure out the cost
 to see if he has enough to finish it?","Otherwise
 when he has laid a foundation and isn\u2019t able to finish everything
 all who see it begin to mock him
","saying
 \u2018This man began to build and wasn\u2019t able to finish!\u2019","\u201cOr what king
 going to make war against another king
 won\u2019t first sit down to consider whether he is able with ten thousand to confront the one coming against him with twenty thousand?","If not
 while the other is still far away
 he sends an ambassador and asks for peace.","So in the same way
 whoever does not renounce all that he has
 cannot be My disciple.","\u201cTherefore
 salt is good; but if the salt should lose its flavor
 how shall it be made salty again?","It is not suitable for the soil or for a manure heap\u2014it is thrown out. The one who has ears to hear
 let him hear.\u201d","\u201cWhich man among you
 if he has a hundred sheep and loses one of them
 will not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go after the lost one until he finds it?","When he has found it
 he puts it on his shoulders
 rejoicing.","And when he comes home
 he calls together his friends and neighbors and says
 \u2018Rejoice with me
 for I\u2019ve found my sheep that was lost!\u2019","I tell you
 in the same way there will be more joy in heaven over one repenting sinner than over the ninety-nine righteous people who have no need of repentance.\u201d","\u201cOr which woman
 if she has ten silver coins and loses one coin
 does not light a lamp
 sweep the house
 and search thoroughly until she finds it?","When she has found it
 she calls together her friends and neighbors
 saying
 \u2018Rejoice with me
 for I\u2019ve found the coin I had lost!\u2019","In the same way
 I tell you
 there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.\u201d","Then Yeshua said
 \u201cA certain man had two sons
","and the younger of them said to the father
 \u2018Father
 give me the share of the property that comes to me.\u2019 So he divided his wealth between them.","\u201cNot many days later
 the younger son gathered everything and traveled to a far country
 and there he squandered his inheritance on wild living.","Now when he had spent everything
 a severe famine came against that country
 and he began to be in need.","So he went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country
 who sent him into his fields to feed pigs.","And he was longing to fill up on the carob pods the pigs were eating
 but no one was giving him any.","\u201cBut when he came to his senses
 he said
 \u2018How many of my father\u2019s hired workers have food overflowing
 but here I am dying of hunger!","I\u2019ll get up and go to my father
 and I\u2019ll say to him
 \u2018Father
 I have sinned against heaven and in your presence.","I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me like one of your hired workers.","\u201cAnd he got up and went to his own father. But while he was still far away
 his father saw him and felt compassion. He ran and fell on his neck and kissed him.","Then the son said to him
 \u2018Father
 I have sinned against heaven and in your presence. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.\u2019","\u201cBut the father said to his slaves
 \u2018Quick! Bring out the best robe and put it on him! Put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet.","Bring the fattened calf and kill it! Let\u2019s celebrate with a feast!","For this son of mine was dead and has come back to life\u2014he was lost and is found!\u2019 Then they began to celebrate.","\u201cNow his older son was out in the field. And as he came near the house
 he heard music and dancing.","And he called out to one of the servants and began to ask what these things could be.","\u201cThe servant said to him
 \u2018Your brother has come
 and your father has killed the fattened calf because he got him back safe and sound.\u2019","\u201cBut the older son was angry and didn\u2019t want to go in. So his father came outside and pleaded with him.","But he answered and said to his father
 \u2018Look
 so many years I\u2019ve slaved away for you\u2014not once did I ignore your order. Yet you\u2019ve never given me a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends.","But when this son of yours came\u2014the one who has squandered your wealth with prostitutes\u2014for him you killed the fattened calf!\u201d","\u201cThen the father said to him
 \u2018Son
 you are always with me
 and everything that is mine is yours.","But it was right to celebrate and rejoice
 because this brother of yours was dead but has come back to life! He was lost
 but is found.\u2019\u201d","Now Yeshua was also saying to the disciples
 \u201cThere was a rich man who had a household manager
 and this manager was accused of squandering his belongings.","So he called the manager and said to him
 \u2018What\u2019s this I hear about you? Give an accounting of your management
 because you cannot be manager any longer.\u2019","\u201cThen the manager said to himself
 \u2018What shall I do
 since my master is taking the management away from me? I\u2019m not strong enough to dig; I\u2019m ashamed to beg.","I know what I\u2019ll do
 so that when I\u2019m put out of management others will welcome me into their homes.\u2019","So he called in each one of his master\u2019s debtors
 and he said to the first
 \u2018How much do you owe my master?\u2019","\u201cHe said
 \u2018One hundred units of olive oil.\u2019 \u201cThe manager said to him
 \u2018Take your bill
 sit down quickly
 and write fifty.\u2019","Then he said to another
 \u2018Now how much do you owe?\u2019 \u201cHe said
 \u2018A hundred units of wheat.\u2019 \u201cThe manager said to him
 \u2018Take your bill and write eighty.\u2019","\u201cNow the master praised the crooked manager because he had acted shrewdly
 for the sons of this age are smarter when dealing with their own generation than the sons of light.","I say to you
 make friends for yourselves from the wealth of the world
 so when it runs out
 they will welcome you into the eternal shelters.","\u201cOne who is faithful in the smallest matters is also faithful in much
 and the one unjust in the smallest matters will likewise be unjust in much.","So then
 if you cannot be trusted with unjust wealth
 who will trust you with true wealth?","Now if you have not been trustworthy with what belongs to another
 who will give you anything of your own?","No servant can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other
 or he will stick by one and look down on the other. You cannot serve God and money.\u201d","But He said to them
 \u201cYou are the ones who justify yourselves before the people
 but God knows your hearts. For what is prized among men is detestable in God\u2019s sight.\u201d","\u201cThe Torah and the Prophets were proclaimed until John. Since then
 the Good News of the kingdom of God is being proclaimed
 and everyone tries forcing his way in.","But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for a single serif of the Torah to fail.","Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery. And he who marries one who is divorced from a husband commits adultery.","\u201cNow there was a rich man dressed in purple and fine linen
 living it up in luxury every day.","But a poor man named Lazarus had been laid at his gate
 covered with sores","and longing to be fed with what fell from the rich man\u2019s table. Besides
 even the dogs were coming to lick his sores.","\u201cIt happened that the poor man died and was carried by the angels to Abraham\u2019s side. Then the rich man also died and was buried.","And from Sheol
 as he was in torment
 he raised his eyes. And he sees Abraham far off
 and Lazarus at his side.","So he cried out and said
 \u2018Father Abraham
 have mercy on me! And send Lazarus so he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool off my tongue
 because I am suffering torment in this flame.\u2019","\u201cBut Abraham said
 \u2018Son
 remember that in your life you received your good things
 even as Lazarus received the bad things. But now he is comforted here
 and you are tormented.","Besides all this
 between us and you a great chasm is firmly set
 so that those who want to cross over to you cannot
 nor can those from there cross over to us.","\u201cThen the rich man said
 \u2018I beg you then
 Father Abraham
 send Lazarus to my father\u2019s house!","For I have five brothers to warn
 so that they will not also come to this place of torment.\u2019","\u201cBut Abraham says
 \u2018They have Moses and the Prophets. Let them listen to them.\u2019","\u201cBut he said
 \u2018No
 Father Abraham
 but if someone from the dead goes to them
 they will repent.\u2019","\u201cBut Abraham said
 \u2018If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets
 neither will they be convinced even if someone rises from the dead!\u2019\u201d","Then Yeshua said to His disciples
 \u201cStumbling blocks are bound to come
 but woe to the one by whom they come!","It would be better for him to have a millstone put around his neck and to be hurled into the sea
 than for him to cause one of these little ones to stumble.","\u201cKeep yourselves alert! If your brother sins
 rebuke him; and if he repents
 forgive him.","Even if he sins against you seven times a day
 and seven times returns to you
 saying
 \u2018I repent
\u2019 you shall forgive him.\u201d","Then the Lord said
 \u201cIf you have faith like a mustard seed
 you could say to this mulberry tree
 \u2018Be uprooted and planted in the sea
\u2019 and it would obey you.","But if you have a slave who is plowing or tending sheep
 who among you will say to him when he comes in from the field
 \u2018Come right in
 and recline at table\u2019?","But won\u2019t he instead say to him
 \u2018Prepare something for me to eat! Dress yourself and wait on me while I eat and drink; and afterward
 you may eat and drink\u2019?","He doesn\u2019t thank the slave because he did what he was commanded
 does he?","So you too
 when you\u2019ve done everything you are commanded
 say
 \u2018We are unworthy slaves. We have done only what we were supposed to do.\u2019\u201d","Now while going up to Jerusalem
 Yeshua was passing between Samaria and the Galilee.","When He saw them
 He said to them
 \u201cGo and show yourselves to the kohanim.\u201d And as they went
 they were cleansed.","Then Yeshua answered and said
 \u201cWeren\u2019t ten cleansed? But where are the nine?","Weren\u2019t any found who came back to give glory to God except this foreigner?\u201d","Then Yeshua said to the man
 \u201cStand up and go! Your faith has made you well.\u201d","Now when Yeshua was asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come
 He answered them and said
 \u201cThe kingdom of God does not come with signs to be seen.","Nor will they say
 \u2018Look
 here!\u2019 or \u2018There!\u2019 For behold
 the kingdom of God is in your midst.\u201d","Then Yeshua said to the disciples
 \u201cThe days will come when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man
 and you will not see it.","They will say to you
 \u2018Look
 there!\u2019 or \u2018Look
 here!\u2019 Do not go and chase after them.","For just as the lightning flashes from one part of the sky and lights up another part
 so will the Son of Man be in His day.","But first He must suffer much and be rejected by this generation.","As it was in the days of Noah
 so will it also be in the days of the Son of Man.","They were eating
 drinking
 marrying
 and being given in marriage
 until the day Noah entered the ark. Then the flood came and destroyed them all.","\u201cIt was just the same in the days of Lot. They were eating
 drinking
 buying
 selling
 planting
 building.","But on the day Lot left Sodom
 it rained fire and sulfur from heaven and destroyed them all.","Things will be the same on the day when the Son of Man is made fully known.","In that day
 the one who is on the roof
 and his possessions in the house
 must not go down to take them away. In the same way
 the one who is in the field must not turn back.","Remember Lot\u2019s wife!","Whoever tries to keep his life will lose it; but whoever loses his life will preserve it.","\u201cI tell you
 on that night there will be two in one bed. One will be taken along and the other left.","There will be two women grinding at the same place. One will be taken and the other left.\u201d (","\u201cWhere
 Lord?\u201d they replied. And He said to them
 \u201cWhere there is a corpse
 there also will the vultures be gathered.\u201d","He said
 \u201cThere was a judge in a certain city who neither feared God nor respected people.","And there was a widow in that city who kept coming to him
 saying
 \u2018Give me justice against my opponent.\u2019","\u201cHe was unwilling at the time. But afterward he said to himself
 \u2018Although I don\u2019t fear God or respect people
","yet because this widow keeps bothering me
 I will give her justice so she won\u2019t wear me out by her incessant coming.\u2019\u201d","Then the Lord said
 \u201cHear what the unjust judge is saying.","Won\u2019t God do justice for His chosen ones
 who cry out to Him day and night? Will He be slow to help them?","I tell you
 He will quickly give them justice. But when the Son of Man comes
 will He find faith on the earth?\u201d","\u201cTwo men went up to the Temple to pray
 one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.","The Pharisee stood and was praying this to himself: \u2018O God
 I thank You that I am not like other people\u2014thieving
 unjust
 adulterers
 or even like this tax collector.","I fast twice a week and tithe on all that I get.\u2019","\u201cBut the tax collector
 standing some distance away
 wouldn\u2019t even lift his eyes toward heaven
 but beat his chest
 saying
 \u2018God
 be merciful to me
 the sinner!\u2019","I tell you
 this man

 but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.\u201d","But Yeshua called for them
 saying
 \u201cLet the little children come to Me and do not hinder them
 for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.","Amen
 I tell you
 whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.\u201d","\u201cWhy are you calling Me good?\u201d Yeshua said to him. \u201cNo one is good except One\u2014that is God.","You know the commandments: \u2018Do not commit adultery
 do not murder
 do not steal
 do not give false testimony
 honor your father and mother.\u2019\u201d","The man said
 \u201cAll these I have kept since my youth.\u201d","When Yeshua heard this
 He said to him
 \u201cOne thing you still lack. Sell all
 as much as you have
 and distribute to the poor
 and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come
 follow Me.\u201d","Gazing at him
 Yeshua said
 \u201cHow hard it is for the rich to enter into the kingdom of God!","It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.\u201d","But Yeshua said
 \u201cWhat is impossible with men is possible with God.\u201d","And Yeshua said to them
 \u201cAmen
 I tell you
 there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children
 for the sake of the kingdom of God
","who will not receive many times as much in this age; and in the olam ha-ba
 eternal life.\u201d","Then Yeshua took the twelve aside and said to them
 \u201cLook
 we\u2019re going up to Jerusalem
 and everything written by the prophets about the Son of Man will be carried out.","He will be handed over to the Gentiles
 and He will be mocked and insulted and spat upon.","After they have scourged Him
 they will kill Him. Yet on the third day
 He will rise again.\u201d","But they understood none of these things; this message was hidden from them
 and they did not understand what He was saying.","\u201cWhat do you want Me to do for you?\u201d And he said
 \u201cMaster
 I want to see again!\u201d","Yeshua said to him
 \u201cReceive your sight. Your faith has made you well.\u201d","When Yeshua came to the place
 He looked up and said to him
 \u201cZacchaeus
 hurry and come down
 for I must stay at your house today.\u201d","But Zacchaeus stood there and said to the Lord. \u201cLook
 Master
 half of my possessions I give to the poor
 and if I have somehow cheated anyone
 I repay four times as much!\u201d","Then Yeshua said to him
 \u201cToday salvation has come to this home
 because he also is a son of Abraham.","For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.\u201d","Therefore He said
 \u201cA certain nobleman went to a faraway land to receive for himself a kingdom and then return.","And calling ten of his own slaves
 he gave them ten minas and said to them
 \u2018Do business until I come back.\u2019","But his citizens detested him and they sent a delegation after him
 saying
 \u2018We don\u2019t want this fellow to reign over us!\u2019","When he returned after receiving the kingdom
 he called for those slaves to whom he had given the money. He wanted to know how much business they had done.","Now the first appeared
 saying
 \u2018Master
 your one mina has made ten.\u2019","The master said to him
 \u2018Well done
 good slave! Because you were faithful with so little
 take charge over ten cities.\u2019","Also
 the second slave came
 saying
 \u2018Your mina
 Master
 made five.\u2019","Then he also said to this one
 \u2018You are likewise over five cities.\u2019","But another came
 saying
 \u2018Master
 here is your mina. I was keeping it safe in a handkerchief
","for I was afraid of you because you are a strict man. You take what you did not make and reap what you did not sow.\u2019","He said to him
 \u2018By the words of your own mouth I will judge you
 you wicked slave! You knew that I am strict
 taking what I did not make and reaping what I did not sow?","Then why didn\u2019t you put my money in the bank
 so that when I came back I could have collected it with interest?\u2019","Then to the bystanders he said
 \u2018Take the mina from him
 and give it to the one who has ten minas.\u2019","But they said to him
 \u2018Sir
 he has ten minas!\u2019","\u2018I tell you
 to everyone who has
 more shall be given. But from the one who doesn\u2019t have
 even what he does have shall be taken away.","But those hostile to me
 who didn\u2019t want me to reign over them
 bring them here and execute them before me.\u2019\u201d","saying
 \u201cGo into the village ahead. As you enter
 you will find a colt tied up
 that no one has ever sat upon. Untie it and bring it.","And if anyone asks you
 \u2018Why are you untying it?\u2019 you shall say
 \u2018The Master needs it.\u2019\u201d","Some of the Pharisees from the crowd said to Him
 \u201cTeacher
 rebuke Your disciples!\u201d","But answering
 Yeshua said
 \u201cI tell you that if these keep silent
 the stones will shout out!\u201d","saying
 \u201cIf only you had recognized this day the things that lead to shalom! But now they are hidden from your eyes.","For the days will come upon you when your enemies will surround you with barricades and hem you in on all sides.","And they will smash you to the ground\u2014you and your children within you. And they won\u2019t leave within you one stone upon another
 because you did not recognize the time of your visitation.\u201d","saying to them
 \u201cIt is written
 \u2018My house shall be a house of prayer
\u2019 but you have made it a \u2018den of thieves.\u2019\u201d","But answering
 Yeshua said to them
 \u201cI also will ask you a question
 and you tell Me:","the immersion of John\u2014was it from heaven or from men?\u201d","And Yeshua said to them
 \u201cNeither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.\u201d","Then He began to tell the people this parable: \u201cA man planted a vineyard
 leased it to tenant farmers
 and went on a journey for a long time.","And at the season
 he sent a servant to the tenants so that they would give him part of the vineyard\u2019s fruit. But the tenants beat him up and sent him away empty-handed.","So he proceeded to send another servant. They beat him too and treated him shamefully
 and they sent him away empty-handed.","And he proceeded to send a third one. They wounded this one too
 and they threw him out.","\u201cNow the master of the vineyard said
 \u2018What shall I do? I will send my son
 whom I love. Probably they will show him respect.\u2019","But when the tenants saw him
 they discussed the matter among themselves
 saying
 \u2018This is the heir! Let\u2019s kill him so the inheritance will be ours.\u2019","So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the master of the vineyard do to them?","He will come and destroy those tenants and give the vineyard to others.\u201d But when they heard this
 they said
 \u201cMay it never happen!\u201d","Then Yeshua looked right at them and said
 \u201cThen what is this that has been written
 \u2018The stone which the builders rejected
 this has become the chief cornerstone\u2019?","Everyone who falls on that stone will be shattered; but the one upon whom it falls
 it will crush him.\u201d","Now they watched Him and sent spies who pretended to be righteous
 in order to trap Him in His words so they could hand Him over to the power and authority of the governor.","\u201cShow me a denarius. Whose image and inscription does it have?\u201d And they said
 \u201cCaesar\u2019s.\u201d","Then He said to them
 \u201cWell then
 give to Caesar the things that are Caesar\u2019s
 and to God the things that are God\u2019s.\u201d","And they could not trap Him in His words in the presence of the people. Astonished by His answer
 they kept silent.","Yeshua said to them
 \u201cThe sons of this age marry and are given in marriage.","But those considered worthy to reach the olam ha-ba and the resurrection of the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage.","For they can no longer die
 because they are like angels and are sons of God
 being sons of the resurrection.","But at the burning bush even Moses revealed that the dead are raised
 when he calls Adonai \u2018the God of Abraham
 and the God of Isaac
 and the God of Jacob.\u2019","Now He is God not of the dead but of the living
 for to Him they all are living.\u201d","Then Yeshua said to them
 \u201cHow can they say that the Messiah is Ben-David?","For David himself says in the Book of Psalms
 \u2018Adonai said to my Lord
 \u201cSit at My right hand
","until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet.\u201d\u2019","David then calls Him \u2018Lord\u2019; so how is He his son?\u201d","\u201cBeware of the Torah scholars
 who like to walk around in long robes. They love greetings in the marketplaces
 the best seats in the synagogues
 and places of honor at feasts.","They devour widows\u2019 houses and make long prayers as a show. These men will receive greater condemnation!\u201d","And He said
 \u201cTruly I say to you
 this poor widow has put in more than all the rest.","For all these put in their gifts from their surplus. But she
 out of her poverty
 put in all she had to live on.\u201d","\u201cAs for these things you are looking at
 the days will come when not one stone will be left upon another. Every one will be torn down!\u201d","And He said
 \u201cWatch out that you are not led astray! For many will come in My name
 saying
 \u2018I am He\u2019 and \u2018The time is near!\u2019 Do not follow them.","And when you hear of wars and chaos
 do not be terrorized. For these things need to happen first
 but the end will not come at once.\u201d","Then He continued telling them
 \u201cNation will rise up against nation
 and kingdom against kingdom.","There will be great earthquakes along with famines and epidemics in various places
 and there will be terrors along with great signs from heaven.","But before all these things
 they will grab you and persecute you
 handing you over to the synagogues and prisons
 and leading you away to kings and governors on account of My name.","This will lead you to be a witness.","So make up your minds not to prepare ahead of time to defend yourselves\u2014","for I Myself will give you speech and wisdom that none of your opponents will be able to resist or refute.","But you will be handed over even by parents
 brothers
 relatives
 and friends\u2014and they will put some of you to death.","And you will be hated by all because of My name.","Yet not a hair of your head will be lost.","By your endurance
 you will gain your souls.","\u201cBut when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies
 then recognize that her desolation is near.","Then those in Judea must flee to the mountains
 and those inside the city must get out
 and those in the countryside must not enter her.","For these are the days of punishment
 to fulfill all that has been written.","\u201cWoe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days! For there will be great distress in the land and wrath on this people.","They will fall by the edge of the sword and be led away captive into all the nations. Jerusalem will be trampled by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.","\u201cThere will be signs in the sun and moon and stars. And upon the earth nations will be confused by the roaring of the sea and its waves.","People will lose heart from fear and anticipation of what is overtaking the earth
 for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.","And then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.","Now when these things begin to happen
 stand straight and lift up your heads
 because your salvation is near!\u201d","Then Yeshua told them a parable: \u201cLook at the fig tree and all the trees.","As soon as they sprout their leaves
 you see it and you know at once that summer is near.","So also
 when you see these all these things happening
 know that the kingdom of God is near.","Amen
 I tell you
 this generation will not pass away until all these things happen.","Heaven and earth will pass away
 but My words will never pass away.","\u201cBut watch out so your hearts are not weighed down by carousing
 strong drink
 and the worries of life. Do not let that day come upon you suddenly like a trap.","For it will come rushing upon all who live on the face of the whole earth.","But stay alert at all times
 praying that you may have the strength to escape all these things about to happen
 and to stand before the Son of Man.\u201d","Now Yeshua sent Peter and John
 saying
 \u201cGo and prepare the Passover for us
 so we may eat.\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cBehold
 when you have entered the city
 a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him into the house that he enters.","And say to the owner of the house
 \u2018The Teacher says to you
 \u201cWhere is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with My disciples?\u201d\u2019","And with that
 he will show you a large upper room
 fully furnished. Make preparations there.\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cI have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.","For I tell you
 I will never eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.\u201d","And when He had taken a cup and offered the bracha
 He said
 \u201cTake this and share it among yourselves.","For I tell you that I will never drink of the fruit of the vine from now on
 until the kingdom of God comes.\u201d","And when He had taken matzah and offered the bracha
 He broke it and gave it to them
 saying
 \u201cThis is My body
 given for you. Do this in memory of Me.\u201d","In the same way
 He took the cup after the meal
 saying
 \u201cThis cup is the new covenant in My blood
 which is poured out for you.","But look
 the hand of the one betraying Me is with Mine on the table.","For indeed
 the Son of Man is going as has been predetermined; but woe to that man by whom He is betrayed!\u201d","And Yeshua said to them
 \u201cThe kings of the nations have mastery over them
 and those exercising authority over them are called \u2018benefactors.\u2019","But with you
 it is not so. Rather
 let the one who is greatest among you become like the youngest
 and the one who leads like the one who serves.","For who is greater
 the one who reclines or the one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines? But I am among you as one who serves.","\u201cYou are the ones who have remained with Me in My times of testing.","And just as My Father has granted Me a kingdom
 so I grant to you","that you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom
 and you shall sit upon thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.","\u201cSimon
 Simon! Indeed
 satan has demanded to sift you all like wheat.","But I have prayed for you
 Simon
 that your faith will not fail. And when you have turned back
 strengthen your brothers.\u201d","But Simon said to Him
 \u201cMaster
 I am ready to go with You even to prison and to death!\u201d","But Yeshua said
 \u201cI tell you
 Peter
 a rooster will not crow today until you have denied three times that you know Me.\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cWhen I sent you out without a money pouch and travel bag and sandals
 you didn\u2019t lack anything
 did you?\u201d They said
 \u201cNo
 nothing.\u201d","Then He said to them
 \u201cBut now
 whoever has a money pouch must carry it as well as a travel bag. And whoever does not own a sword must sell his cloak and buy one.","For I tell you that this which is written must be fulfilled in Me: \u2018And he was counted with the lawless.\u2019 For what is written about Me is being fulfilled.\u201d","But they said
 \u201cMaster
 look here! Two swords!\u201d And He said to them
 \u201cIt is enough.\u201d","When he reached the place
 He said to them
 \u201cPray that you will not enter into temptation.\u201d","saying
 \u201cFather
 if You are willing
 take this cup from Me; yet not My will
 but Yours be done.\u201d","And He said to them
 \u201cWhy are you sleeping? Get up and pray
 so that you won\u2019t enter into temptation.\u201d","But Yeshua said to him
 \u201cJudah
 with a kiss you betray the Son of Man?\u201d","But Yeshua answered and said
 \u201cStop this now!\u201d And He touched the man\u2019s ear and healed him.","Then Yeshua said to the ruling kohanim
 officers of the Temple guard
 and the elders who had come against Him
 \u201cHave you come out with swords and clubs as you would against a revolutionary?","Every day I was with you in the Temple
 yet you did not lay a finger on Me. But this is yours\u2014the hour and the power of darkness.\u201d","And the Lord turned and looked straight at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word of the Lord
 how He had told him
 \u2018Before the rooster crows today
 you will deny Me three times.\u2019","\u201cIf You are Mashiach
 tell us.\u201d But Yeshua said to them
 \u201cIf I tell you
 you will never believe;","and if I ask you
 you will never answer.","But from now on
 the Son of Man is seated at the right hand of the power of God.\u201d","Then they all said
 \u201cAre You then Ben-Elohim?\u201d And to them He said
 \u201cYou say that I am.\u201d","So Pilate questioned Him
 saying
 \u201cAre You the King of the Jews?\u201d \u201cAs you say
\u201d Yeshua replied.","But when Pilate heard this
 he asked whether the Man was a Galilean.","And he said to them
 \u201cYou brought this Man to me as one who incites the people to revolt. But having examined Him in your presence
 I have found no case against this Man regarding what you accuse Him of doing.","And a third time he spoke to them
 \u201cWhy? What evil has this One done? I have found in Him no fault deserving of death. Therefore
 I will scourge and release Him.\u201d","But Yeshua
 turning to them
 said
 \u201cDaughters of Jerusalem
 do not weep for Me
 but for yourselves and your children.","For indeed
 the days are coming when they will say
 \u2018Blessed are barren
 and the wombs that never gave birth
 and the breasts that did not feed.\u2019","\u2018Then they will begin to say to the montains
 \u2018Fall on us!\u2019 and to the hills
 \u2018Cover us!\u2019","\u201cFor if they do these things when the wood is green
 what will happen when it is dry?\u201d","But Yeshua was saying
 \u201cFather
 forgive them
 for they do not know what they are doing.\u201d Then they cast lots
 dividing up His clothing.","Yeshua said to him
 \u201cAmen
 I tell you
 today you shall be with Me in Paradise.\u201d","And Yeshua
 crying out with a loud voice
 said
 \u201cFather
 \u2018into Your hands I entrust My spirit.\u2019\u201d When He had said this
 He breathed His last.","The women were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground
 but the men said to them
 \u201cWhy do you search for the living among the dead?","Then He said to them
 \u201cWhat are these things you are discussing with one another as you are walking along?\u201d They stood still
 looking gloomy.","Yeshua said to them
 \u201cWhat kind of things?\u201d And they said to Him
 \u201cThe things about Yeshua from Natzeret
 who was a Prophet
 powerful in deed and word before God and all the people\u2014","Yeshua said to them
 \u201cOh foolish ones
 so slow of heart to put your trust in all that the prophets spoke!","Was it not necessary for Messiah to suffer these things and to enter into His glory?\u201d","While they were speaking of these things
 Yeshua Himself stood in the midst of them and said
 \u201cShalom Aleichem!\u201d","Then He said to them
 \u201cWhy are you so shaken? And why do doubts arise in your heart?","Look at My hands and My feet\u2014it is I Myself! Touch Me and see! For a spirit doesn\u2019t have flesh and bones
 as you see I have.\u201d","But while they were still in disbelief due to joy and wonder
 He said to them
 \u201cDo you have anything to eat here?\u201d","Then He said to them
 \u201cThese are My words which I spoke to you while I was still with you\u2014everything written concerning Me in the Torah of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled.","and He said to them
 \u201cSo it is written
 that the Messiah is to suffer and to rise from the dead on the third day
","and that repentance for the removal of sins is to be proclaimed in His name to all nations
 beginning from Jerusalem.","You are witnesses of these things.","And behold
 I am sending the promise of My Father upon you; but you are to stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high.\u201d","And he said to them
 What is it that ye sought me? knew ye not that in those things that be of my Father [wist ye not

 it behooveth me to be? ","And Jesus answered to him
 It is written
 That a man liveth not in bread alone
 but in every word of God. ","and said to him
 I shall give to thee all this power
 and the glory of them
 for to me they be given

 I give them; ","And Jesus answered
 and said to him
 It is written
 Thou shalt worship thy Lord God [Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God]
 and to him alone thou shalt serve. ","And he led him into Jerusalem
 and set him on the pinnacle of the temple
 and said to him
 If thou art God's Son
 send thyself from hence down; ","And Jesus answered
 and said to him
 It is said
 Thou shalt not tempt thy Lord God. [And Jesus answering saith to him
 It is said
 Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.] ","The Spirit of the Lord is on me
 for which thing he anointed me; he sent me to preach to poor men
 to heal contrite men in heart
 and to preach remission to prisoners
 and sight to blind men[a]
 and to deliver broken men into remission; ","to preach the year of the Lord pleasant
 and the day of yielding again [to preach the year of the Lord accepted
 or pleasant
 and the day of retribution
 or yielding again.] ","And he began to say to them
 For in this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears. ","And he said to them
 Soothly ye shall say to me this likeness
 Physician
 heal thyself. The Pharisees said to Jesus
 How great things have we heard done in Capernaum
 do thou also here in thy country. [And he said to them
 Soothly ye shall say to me this likeness
 Leech
 heal thyself. How great things have we heard done in Capernaum
 make thou and here in thy country.] ","And he said
 Truly I say to you
 that no prophet is received in his own country. [Soothly he saith
 Truly I say to you
 for no man prophet is accepted
 or received
 in his own country.]","In truth I say to you
 that many widows were in the days of Elias
 the prophet
 in Israel
 when heaven was closed three years and six months
 when great hunger was made in all the earth [when great hunger was made on all earth
 or every land];","and to none of them was Elias sent
 but into Sarepta of Sidon
 to a woman a widow. ","And many mesels were in Israel
 under Eliseus
 the prophet
 and none of them was cleansed
 but Naaman of Syria. ","And they were astonished in his teaching
 for his word was in power. ","And Jesus blamed him
 and said [saying]
 Wax dumb
 and go out from him. And when the fiend had cast him forth into the middle
 he went away from him
 and he harmed him nothing. ","And fiends went out from many
 and cried
 and said [crying
 and saying]
 For thou art the Son of God. And he blamed
 and suffered them not to speak [And he blaming suffered not them to speak]
 for they knew him
 that he was Christ. ","To whom he said
 For also to other cities it behooveth me to preach the kingdom of God
 for therefore I am sent [for thereto I am sent]. ","And as he ceased to speak
 he said to Simon
 Lead out into the depth
 and slack your nets to take fish [and slake ye your nets into the taking]. ","Soothly in like manner James and John
 the sons of Zebedee
 that were fellows of Simon Peter [which were fellows of Simon Peter]. And Jesus said to Simon
 Do not thou dread; now from this time thou shalt take men. ","And Jesus held forth his hand
 and touched him
 and said [saying]
 I will
 be thou made clean. And at once [And anon] the leprosy passed away from him. ","And Jesus commanded to him
 that he should say to no man; But go
 show thee to a priest
 and offer for thy cleansing
 as Moses bade
 into witnessing to them. ","And when Jesus saw the faith of them
 he said
 Man
 thy sins be forgiven to thee. ","And as Jesus knew the thoughts of them
 he answered
 and said to them [he answering said to them]
 What think ye evil things in your hearts? ","What is lighter to say
 Sins be forgiven to thee
 or to say
 Rise up
 and walk? ","But that ye know
 that man's Son hath power in earth to forgive sins
 he said to the sick man in palsy
 I say to thee
 rise up
 take thy bed
 and go into thine house. ","And after these things Jesus went out
 and saw a publican
 Levi by name
 sitting at the tollbooth. And he said to him
 Follow thou me; ","And Jesus answered
 and said to them
 They that be whole have no need to a physician
 but they that be sick; [And Jesus answering saith to them
 They that be whole have not need to a leech
 but they that have evil;] ","for I came not to call just men
 but sinful men to penance. ","And they said to him
 Why the disciples of John fast oft
 and make prayers
 also and of the Pharisees
 but thine eat and drink? ","To whom he said
 Whether ye be able to make the sons of the spouse to fast [Whether ye may make the sons of the spouse to fast]
 while the spouse is with them? ","But days shall come
 when the spouse shall be taken away from them

 and putteth it into an old clothing [and putteth it into an old cloth]; else both he breaketh the new
 and the piece of the new accordeth not to the old. ","And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine shall break the bottles
 and the wine shall be shed out
 and the bottles shall perish. ","But new wine oweth to be put into new bottles [But new wine is to be put into new wine vessels]
 and both be kept. ","And no man drinking the old
 will at once the new; for he saith
 The old is the better. [And no man drinking old
 will anon new; soothly he saith
 The old is better.]","And Jesus answered
 and said to them [And Jesus answering said to them]
 Have ye not read
 what David did
 when he hungered
 and they that were with him; ","how he entered into the house of God
 and took loaves of proposition
 and ate
 and gave to them that were with him; which loaves it was not leaveful to eat
 but only to priests[a]. ","And he said to them
 For man's Son is Lord
 yea
 of the sabbath. ","And he knew the thoughts of them

 and stood. ","And Jesus said to them

 he said to the man
 Hold forth thine hand. And he held forth

 shall be said in light; and that that ye have spoken in [the] ear in bedchambers [and that that ye have spoken in the ear in couches]
 shall be preached in roofs. ","And I say to you
 my friends
 be ye not afeared of them [be not afeared of them] that slay the body
 and after these things have no more what they shall do. ","But I shall show to you
 whom ye shall dread; dread ye him
 that after he hath slain [which after he hath slain]
 hath power to send into hell. And so I say to you
 dread ye him. ","Whether five sparrows be not sold for two halfpence [for two farthings]; and one of them is not in forgetting before God?","But also all the hairs of your head be numbered. Therefore do not ye dread; ye be of more price than many sparrows.","Truly I say to you
 each man that acknowledgeth me before men [Truly I say to you

 and to magistrates
 and potentates
 do not ye be busy
 how or what ye shall answer
 or what ye shall say. ","For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in that hour
 what it behooveth you to say. ","And he said to him
 Man
 who ordained me a doomsman
 or a parter
 on you [over you]? ","And he said to them
 See ye
 and beware of all covetousness; for the life of a man is not in the abundance of the things
 which he wieldeth. ","And he told to them a likeness
 and said
 The field of a rich man brought forth plenteous fruits. [Soothly he said to them a likeness
 saying
 The field of some rich man brought forth plenteous fruits.] ","And he thought within himself
 and said [saying]
 What shall I do
 for I have not whither I shall gather my fruits? ","And he saith
 This thing I shall do; I shall throw down my barns
 and I shall make greater

 and my goods. ","And I shall say to my soul
 Soul
 thou hast many goods kept into full many years [thou hast many goods put up
 or kept
 into full many years]; rest thou

 Fool
 in this night they shall take thy life from thee. And whose shall those things be
 that thou hast arrayed? [Soothly God said to him
 Fool
 in this night they shall ask of thee thy soul. Forsooth whose shall those things be
 which thou hast made ready?] ","So is he that treasureth to himself
 and is not rich in God. ","And he said to his disciples
 Therefore I say to you
 do not ye be busy to your life
 what ye shall eat
 neither to your body
 with what ye shall be clothed. ","The life is more than meat
 and the body more than clothing. ","Behold the crows
 for they sow not
 neither reap [nor reap]

","And who of you by thinking may put one cubit to his stature [may add one cubit to his stature]?","Therefore if ye be not able to do that that is least [Therefore if ye may not do that that is least]

 that neither Solomon in all his glory was clothed as one of these. ","And if God clotheth thus the hay
 that to day is in the field [which to day is in the field]
 and to morrow is cast into an oven; how much more you of little faith. ","And do not ye seek
 what ye shall eat
 or what ye shall drink; and do not ye be raised on high. ","For folks of the world seek all these things; and your Father knoweth
 that ye have need to all these things. ","Nevertheless seek ye first the kingdom of God
 and all these things shall be cast to you. ","Do not ye

 dread

 neither moth destroyeth. ","For where is thy treasure
 there thine heart shall be. [Forsooth where thy treasure is

 and serve them. ","And if he [shall] come in the second waking
 and if he come in the third waking
 and find so

 in what hour the thief would come

 My lord tarrieth to come; and begin to smite children

 in the day that he hopeth not

 but that it be kindled? ","And I have to be baptized with a baptism

 A man [Some man] had a fig tree planted in his vineyard

 To what thing is the kingdom of God like? and to what thing shall I guess it to be like? ","It is like to a corn of mustard seed

 To what thing shall I guess the kingdom of God like? ","It is like to sourdough

 that none of those men that be called

 and said to them
 ","If any man cometh to me [If any man come to me]

 A man had two sons [Some man had two sons]; ","and the younger of them said to the father
 Father
 give me the portion of chattel

 when all things were gathered together
 the younger son went forth in pilgrimage into a far country; and there he wasted his goods in living lecherously [and there he wasted his substance

 and said
 How many hired men in my father's house have plenty of loaves; and I perish here through hunger [forsooth I perish here in hunger]. ","I shall rise up

 and came to his father. And when he was yet afar
 his father saw him

 and fell on his neck

 Father
 I have sinned into heaven [Father
 I have sinned against heaven]

 Swiftly bring ye forth the first stole

 and approached to the house [and nighed to the house]
 he heard a symphony and a crowd. ","And he called one of the servants
 and asked
 what these things were. ","And he said to him
 Thy brother is come
 and thy father slew a fat calf[d]
 for he received him safe. ","And he was wroth
 and would not come in. Therefore his father went out
 and began to pray him. ","And he answered to his father
 and said
 Lo! so many years I serve thee

 that hath devoured his substance with whores
 came
 thou hast slain to him a fat calf.[f] ","And he said to him
 Son
 thou art evermore with me [Son
 thou art ever with me]

 and to have joy; for this thy brother was dead
 and lived again [and liveth again]; he perished
 and is found.","He said also to his disciples
 There was a rich man
 that had a bailiff [There was some rich man
 that had a farmer

 What hear I this thing of thee? yield reckoning of thy bailiffship

 What shall I do

 How much owest thou to my lord? ","And he said
 An hundred barrows of oil. And he said to him
 Take thy caution [Take thy caution

 And how much owest thou? Which answered
 An hundred cors of wheat [Which said
 An hundred measures of wheat]. And he said to him
 Take thy letters

 Ye it be

 Lazarus by name

 and licked his boils. ","And it was done
 that the beggar died
 and was borne of angels into Abraham's bosom. And the rich man was dead also
 and was buried in hell. ","And he raised up his eyes
 when he was in torments
 and saw Abraham afar

 and said
 Father Abraham
 have mercy on me
 and send Lazarus

 and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame. ","And Abraham said to him
 Son
 have mind

 Then I pray thee
 father
 that thou send him into the house of my father. ","For I have five brethren

 lest also they come into this place of torments. ","And Abraham said to him [And Abraham saith to him]
 They have Moses and the prophets; hear they them. ","And he said
 Nay
 father Abraham

 they shall do penance. ","And he said to him
 If they hear not Moses and the prophets

 It is impossible that causes of stumbling come not; but woe to that man
 by whom they come. [And he said to his disciples
 It is impossible that offences come not; but woe to him

 There was a judge in a city
 that dreaded not God
 neither shamed of men.[a]","And a widow was in that city

 Venge me of mine adversary; ","and he would not long time [and he would not by much time]. But after these things he said within himself
 Though I dread not God

 ","nevertheless for this widow is heavy to me
 I shall venge her; lest at the last she coming condemn me [lest at the last she coming strangle me]. ","And the Lord said
 Hear ye
 what the doomsman of wickedness saith; ","and whether God shall not do [the] vengeance of his chosen
 crying to him day and night

 for soon he shall do [the] vengeance of them. Nevertheless guessest thou
 that man's Son coming shall find faith in earth? ","Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee
 and the other a publican. ","And the Pharisee stood
 and prayed by himself these things
 and said [Forsooth the Pharisee standing
 prayed with himself these things

 God
 I do thankings to thee

 as also this publican; ","I fast twice in the week
 I give tithes of all things that I have in possession. ","And the publican stood afar
 and would not raise his eyes to heaven

 this went down into his house
 and was justified from the other. For each that enhanceth himself
 shall be made low

 shall be enhanced. ","But Jesus called together them
 and said
 Suffer ye children to come to me
 and do not ye forbid them
 for of such is the kingdom of heavens. ","Truly I say to you
 whoever shall not take the kingdom of God as a child

 What sayest thou me good? No man is good
 but God alone. ","Thou knowest the commandments
 Thou shalt not slay
 Thou shalt not do lechery

 I have kept all these things from my youth.","And when this thing was heard
 Jesus said to him
 Yet one thing faileth to thee; sell thou all things that thou hast

 said
 How hard they that have money shall enter into the kingdom of God; [Soothly Jesus seeing him made sorrowful said
 How hard they that have riches shall enter into the realm of God;]","for it is lighter a camel to pass through a needle's eye

 than a rich man for to enter into the kingdom of God.]","And he said to them
 Those things that be impossible with men
 be possible with God. ","And he said to him
 Truly I say to you
 there is no man that shall forsake house

 and said to them

 and bespat; ","and after that they have scourged him
 they shall slay him

 Lord
 that I see. ","And Jesus said to him
 Behold; thy faith hath made thee safe. ","And Jesus beheld up

 Zacchaeus

 and said to the Lord

 I give the half of my goods to poor men; and if I have any thing defrauded any man

 For to day health is made to this house
 for that he is Abraham's son; [Jesus said to him
 For in this day health is made to this house

 A worthy man went into a far country [Some nobleman went into a far country]

 We will not

 and said [saying]
 Lord
 thy bezant hath won ten bezants. ","He said to him

 Lord
 thy bezant hath made five bezants. ","And to this he said

 And be thou upon five cities.]","And the third came
 and said
 Lord
 lo! thy bezant

 put up in a sudarium.[b] ","For I dreaded thee

 Wicked servant

 Take away from him the bezant

 Go ye into the castle
 that is against you; into which as ye enter [into which ye entering]
 ye shall find a colt of an ass tied

 and bring ye to me. ","And if any man ask you
 why ye untie
 thus ye shall say to him
 For the Lord desireth his work. ","And some of the Pharisees of the people said to him [And some of the Pharisees of the companies said to him]
 Master

 I say to you
 for if these [shall] be still

 For if thou haddest known
 thou shouldest weep also; for in this day the things be in peace to thee

 It is written
 That mine house is an house of prayer

 and said to them
 And I shall ask you one word; answer ye to me. [Forsooth Jesus answering said to them
 I shall ask you one word; answer ye to me.] ","Was the baptism of John of heaven
 or of men? ","And Jesus said to them
 Neither I say to you
 in what power I do these things. ","And he began to say to the people this parable. A man planted a vineyard [Some man planted a vineyard]
 and hired it to tillers; and he was gone in pilgrimage long time.","And in the time of gathering of grapes
 he sent a servant to the tillers
 that they should give to him of the fruit of the vineyard; which beat him
 and let him go void. ","And he thought yet to send another servant; and [also] they beat this
 and tormented him sore
 and let him go void. ","And he thought yet to send the third
 and him also they wounded
 and casted [cast] him out. ","And the lord of the vineyard said
 What shall I do? I shall send my dear-worthy son; peradventure
 when they see him
 they shall dread [they shall be ashamed]. ","And when the tillers saw him
 they thought within themselves
 and said [saying]
 This is the heir
 slay we him
 that the heritage be [made] ours. ","And they casted [cast] him out of the vineyard
 and killed him. What shall then the lord of the vineyard do to them [What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do to them]? ","He shall come
 and destroy these tillers [and lose these tillers]
 and [he shall] give the vineyard to others. And when this thing was heard
 they said to him
 God forbid [Far be it]. ","But he beheld them
 and said
 What then is this that is written
 The stone which men building reproved
 this is made into the head of the corner? ","Each that shall fall on that stone
 shall be bruised
 but on whom it shall fall

 and said to him
 The emperor's [They answering said to him
 Caesar's]. ","And he said to them
 Yield ye therefore to the emperor those things that be the emperor's [Yield ye therefore to Caesar those things that be Caesar's]

 and held peace. ","And Jesus said to them
 Sons of this world wed
 and be given to weddings; ","but they that shall be had worthy of that world

 and rising again from dead men]
 neither be wedded
 nor wed wives
 ","neither they shall be able to die more; for they be even with angels

 The Lord God of Abraham

 How say men

 feigning long prayer; these shall take more damnation.]","And he said
 Truly I say to you
 that this poor widow cast more than all men. ","For why all these of [the] thing that was plenteous to them [For why all these of the abundance

 Folk shall rise against folk
